8430030 of course weve got to tackle climate change its a real and present danger for used but weve also got to be absolutely clear that our energy policy has got to be figured first and foremost with a view to supplying britain with affordable and secure energy it needs for the future

8430032 energy security is fundamental to our existence as an independent democratic free state
8430033 i think the events not just in georgia but over a longer timescale have really confirmed the growing importance of energy independence for the uk

8430042 while i have never been a hillary fan i thought she did a terrific job last night she struck the right tone to help bring her voting block along personally as an obama supporter i appreciated her performance and thought it hit all of the right notes
8430043 words words words yes she is a forceful speaker and some say the dems should have nominated her i disagree she has zero credibility with half the electorate does anyone believe her endorsement of obama is motivated by anything other than preserving her viability as presidential material next time
8430044 moscow has laid the foundations for the occupation of crimea with years of careful propaganda its like hitlers excuse of helping the ethnic germans in the sudetenland as justification for the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1938 i have no doubt that now that the georgian conflict is over russia aims to take over crimea the level of hatred against anything ukrainian here is astonishing many people have been attacked in the street for merely speaking ukrainian you can talk french german or chinese here without problems but if you speak ukrainian people often come up and start insulting you

8430106 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8430107 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8430108 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8430109 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones

8430137 this regulation will damage an industry which is already on its knees without delivering any obvious welfare or efficiency gains

8430162 it also affects obviously the quality of our relationship with russia
8430163 the u s and several eu countries have been pushing for quite some time to have routes for oil and gas that would circumvent russian territory
8430164 the russians saw this as a direct threat to their interests

8430172 people are scared because every day the dragons come down and eat our goats
8430173 today its a goat and tomorrow it can be our child

8430202 our global competitiveness depends on americas having the best science and technology
8430203 to keep our lead we must support it it is vital that federal funding at least keep pace with our closest competitors in europe and asia
8430204 were seeing really talented scientists lose their grants not because they dont have strong proposals but because the grant money isnt there to say its demoralizing is an understatement it deters postdocs and over time will erode our ability to have new applications from basic research
8430205 universities have had to dip into endowments or tuition or internal funds to keep the labs lights on if investigators are falling short in research grant competitions
8430206 or they are using their own funds to get the labs equipped or built so they can better compete for increasingly scarce federal funds
8430207 we are calling on private resources to provide more bridge funding for investigators
8430208 unfortunately we have not made the case for increasing federal backing of academic r amp d strongly enough so far
8430209 but we have a tremendous opportunity to work with the campaigns each of the campaigns has been emphasizing the need to strengthen the american economy and we obviously believe that doing that is tightly linked to advancing the sciences
8430210 the point is that science continues to sink on the priority list for this country to the detriment of all of us

8430213 adults disguised as birdwatchers mask their debauchery by taking trips in groups
8430214 they can then achieve climax in the safety of the woods particularly disturbing is the high number of senior citizens using binoculars to observe birds mating these horny peeping toms satisfy their craving for sex by focusing their debasement on birds this perversion must be halted otherwise the entire moral fibre of our nation is going to hell
8430215 we believed in ourselves it wasnt a good performance but we knew we had the quality to score a goal
8430216 we may assist the israeli government in locating and negotiating the release of the hostage if requested to do so through its ambassador
8430217 all we can say at the moment is that an israeli businessman was kidnapped from the coastal city of port harcourt in nigeria near the rivers delta
8430218 this area has been known for years as a designated kidnapping and smuggling area and as a tense region on the backdrop of political tribal tensions the motives behind the israeli nationals abduction are unclear at this stage
8430219 the foreign ministrys situation room has appointed a special operations team to closely monitor the developments and try to speed up the release process israels ambassador to nigeria moshe ram is in the city where the abduction took place and is closely handling the necessary inquiries
8430220 in the meantime we have no news all we know is that he was kidnapped and we are waiting for information
8430221 we are waiting for the kidnappers to call and tell us what they want they should call people at the foreign ministry the israeli embassy in nigeria the company us someone we are standing here and waiting to hear what they want because at the moment we have no information
8430222 its all in their hands we are waiting for any information what the kidnappers want where he is being held in the meantime we dont even know who took him no one has claimed responsibility so far we still dont know if its criminally or nationalistically motivated
8430223 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8430224 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8430225 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8430226 this policy is a terrible blow to the average victorian seeking to pursue tafe training and effectively shifts the responsibility for tafe funding from the government to the individual
8430227 over the next two years fees will increase by up to 42 5 per cent in certificate iii and iv courses from 877 to 1250 and by almost 300 per cent in diploma and advanced diploma from 877 to 2500
8430228 instead of directing funding to areas with the worst skills shortages the governments reforms in fact encourage competition between tafe institutes and private providers
8430229 we havent finalised the plans at this stage for how many will stop at the station but we certainly know the ararat trains will at the very least stopping there
8430230 but we are still working it out with the department of transport to see how many of the ballarat services will stop there bearing in mind it is a single track
8430231 its a case of how many we will be able to get out there
8430232 ultimately we will work through how many additional ballarat trains can start and finish in wendouree and we want that to be as many as possible
8430233 our contractors have completed all the drainage and the lighting is now installed
8430234 we are looking at doing the asphalting next week depending on the weather
8430235 this is a big step forward for one of the nations most vibrant regional centres
8430236 ballarat offers not only the infrastructure but also high quality graduates who enable us to accelerate the development of innovative technology solutions for our clients across the globe
8430237 currently ibm employs 817 people in ballarat and 50 per cent of these comprise graduates or students of the university
8430238 these things do not happen by accident but is a strategic collaboration
8430239 were going to lose that ice so weve got to understand what this means for the rest of us
8430240 two weeks ago the federal climate change science program released a
8430241 current sea ice reduction is progressing at a very fast rate that appears to have
8430242 in the next few years putting carbon into our atmosphere is going to be as civilized as puking on your grandmothers china
8430243 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8430244 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8430245 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8430246 weve had two powerful women speak back to back on each night michelle obama and hillary clinton
8430247 this has been a joy we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time trying
8430248 we will leave denver united my goal is that we win in november
8430249 please answer the question sir are you mr koslowski of the polish resistance
8430250 please dont be afraid mr koslowski were friendly to you im commander john bradley of the 22nd regiment special air service behind me is specialist paul foley and if youll give me half a tick ill introduce you to the other two
8430251 gday mr koslowski im specialist mick connors and this daffy looking bastard behind me here is specialist david jones
8430252 if he had continued the slowest he would have run would have been 9 52
8430253 this is his first year of running the 100 meters
8430254 in two more years he should be peaking at this distance and by then i am certain he will be down to there
8430255 we havent had a review of the fee structure for almost five years and that is obviously unsatisfactory the fees are on a sliding scale based on herd numbers but the reality is that on some smaller units where the handling facilities may be less than adequate our members are frequently working for less than the minimum wage that cannot continue
8430256 we most certainly dont wish to break off relations with farmer clients who are highly valued but there has to be a sensible approach from animal health
8430257 our excellent record on animal health is dependent on preserving our declining network of large animal veterinary practices
8430258 for farmers due to test their herds for tb our advice is to contact your vet and discuss a date for the visit under current rules if a herd test is not completed on time then movement restrictions can apply
8430259 it has sustained its performance and will continue its growth with the commercial warhorse s amp ns business was we are very bullish on britain
8430260 the downturn we face generally is cyclical we dont think we will have such a bad summer every year we are taking a long term view on the british market the british love beer and we have inherited some great brands from s amp n
8430261 after all that extraordinary outrage directed at me not one person has called me up and said hey brian it looks like you might have had a point after all
8430262 we say bush is so blinded by ideology that he ignores the facts in the real world and thats true
8430263 arent we doing the same thing were being just like bush
8430264 one of the most severe tongue lashings ive ever seen administered to a public official at least face to face
8430265 we ought to just say that it worked people were understandably skeptical of the administration at the time but we have to acknowledge reality do you stay with a political position because its popular even if it doesnt square with the facts
8430266 the people in our party advocating for an immediate withdrawal of troops last year had gotten their way it would have been disastrous for the u s
8430267 this capability is a crucial first step in defining translational therapies to ameliorate the effects of inner ear disease in humans
8430268 although still a long way from the clinic the work shows that gene therapy is a potential treatment to combat some forms of congenital deafness
8430269 with one in 2 000 children born deaf because of genetic defects such a therapy would clearly be of value
8430270 when you start from nothing you can build something better because you are building from the ground up
8430271 wsm has 8 points of agreement that you can find at their website they are certainly
8430272 just skip over it for now and just come back and read it a little later
8430273 like the issue that we had with the dog he was unable to get to that meter we are going to try to send somebody out on that particular meter and try to read it in the next couple days
8430274 until we would be able to try to read the meter
8430275 on an average day it averages out to the 760 range per meter reader yes
8430276 are the punishments too harsh for students who break school uniform policies
8430277 i really think some people need to get off their high horses and quit worrying about appearing weak and make a compromise a child that looks presentable should not be removed from his her class because of a slight infraction look at whats important here our childrens education
8430278 i was upset that it happened again but i was glad to hear hes caught because hes needed to be caught for a long time
8430279 he would call me and make inappropriate remarks and inappropriate touching that shouldnt happen to a 12 year old girl
8430280 i want encourage anyone one out there if hes done this to you or another person to come forward its okay its not your fault

8430282 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8430283 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8430284 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8430285 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8430286 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
8430287 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
8430288 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
8430289 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
8430290 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
8430291 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
8430292 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
8430293 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
8430294 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
8430295 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
8430296 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
8430297 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
8430298 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
8430299 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
8430300 if you commit offences if you are arrested again you will be back before the court probably before me and you wont be getting bail again
8430301 a significant number of residents on blackberry lane are very concerned by the closure of the lane as this was our alternative escape route in case of a bushfire
8430302 were concerned about our lives in the face of a bushfire
8430303 we want to be able to drive down there if we cant get out the other way we just dont want to get trapped up there
8430304 the lanes have been used in perpetuity for over a hundred years for vehicular and foot traffic
8430305 there will also be consultation with all the residents in the precinct providing them with the opportunity to also have a key
8430306 he has a groin problem we knew it could be like this and i was surprised when i was reading some of the newspapers saying he has to play and has to start but he had a problem and now he will have an operation and will

8430308 the master idea that has governed the life the culture social ideals of the indian people has been the seeking of man for his true spiritual self and the use of life as a frame and means for that discovery and for mans ascent from the ignorant natural into the spiritual existence
8430309 marc edouard is one of the top young defenseman in the game and we are excited to have him in the fold for the next several years
8430310 he has a tremendous future with this franchise and we look forward to watching his continued development
8430311 a stay is necessary in the civil case to preserve the secrecy of the ongoing grand jury proceedings
8430312 about their views on the role of citizenship and service in post 9 11 america
8430313 we are very concerned that he may have been doing traffic stops or otherwise approaching people and taking police action
8430314 users make their credibility based decisions about the people or organization behind the site based upon the sites overall visual appeal
8430315 users said they were more likely to believe web sites that looked professionally designed
8430316 a picture is worth a thousand words an interface is worth a thousand pictures
8430317 design is so critical it should be on the agenda of every meeting in every single department
8430318 design is not just what it looks like and feels like design is how it works
8430319 beauty and brains pleasure and usability they should go hand in hand
8430320 we require from buildings two kinds of goodness first the doing their practical duty well then that they be graceful and pleasing in doing it
8430321 design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose
8430322 to design is to communicate clearly by whatever means you can control or master
8430323 design is directed toward human beings to design is to solve human problems by identifying them and executing the best solution
8430324 design is the art of gradually applying constraints until only one solution remains
8430325 the greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution
8430326 interactive design is a seamless blend of graphic arts technology and psychology
8430327 leonardo da vinci combined art and science and aesthetics and engineering that kind of unity is needed once again
8430328 we find that people quickly evaluate a site by visual design alone
8430329 true interactivity is not about clicking on icons or downloading files its about encouraging communication
8430330 to dismiss front end design as mere icing is to jeopardize the success of any site
8430331 good designers can create normalcy out of chaos they can clearly communicate ideas through the organizing and manipulating of words and pictures
8430332 the ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak
8430333 the basis for success of media products in addition to their usability and efficiency is often the potential to arouse
8430334 visual appearance is one of the most effective variables for quickly differentiating one application from another
8430335 if a site is perfectly usable but it lacks an elegant and appropriate design style it will fail
8430336 ive been amazed at how often those outside the discipline of design assume that what designers do is decoration good design is problem solving
8430337 like all forms of design visual design is about problem solving not about personal preference or unsupported opinion
8430338 making the simple complicated is commonplace making the complicated simple awesomely simple thats creativity
8430339 the architect should strive continually to simplify the ensemble of the rooms should then be carefully considered that comfort and utility may go hand in hand with beauty
8430340 the location of visual elements in the ui has a huge impact on how the user interprets information
8430341 the design of good houses requires an understanding of both the construction materials and the behavior of real humans
8430342 the fusion of art and technology that we call interface design
8430343 that strange new zone between medium and message that zone we call the interface
8430344 form follows function that has been misunderstood form and function should be one joined in a spiritual union
8430345 questions about whether design is necessary or affordable are quite beside the point design is inevitable the alternative to good design is bad design not no design at all
8430346 science arose from poetry when times change the two can meet again on a higher level as friends
8430347 effective communication is a key factor in the success of your product
8430348 problems with visual design can turn users off so quickly that they never discover all the smart choices you made with navigation or interaction design
8430349 good design is the most important way to differentiate ourselves from our competitors
8430350 where you innovate how you innovate and what you innovate are design problems
8430351 your products run for election every day and good design is critical to winning the campaign
8430352 when people talk about innovation in this decade they really mean design
8430353 design is the fundamental soul of a human made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service
8430354 you cant just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them by the time you get it built theyll want something new
8430355 i prefer design by experts by people who know what they are doing
8430356 the commonality between science and art is in trying to see profoundly to develop strategies of seeing and showing
8430357 design can be art design can be aesthetics design is so simple thats why it is so complicated
8430358 simplicity is not the goal it is the by product of a good idea and modest expectations
8430359 a designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add but when there is nothing left to take away
8430360 truly elegant design incorporates top notch functionality into a simple uncluttered form
8430361 when you take technology and mix it with art you always come up with something innovative
8430362 an enterprises most vital assets lie in its design and other creative capabilities
8430363 business success is always defined by the quality of the overall customer experience
8430364 websites that are hard to use frustrate customers forfeit revenue and erode brands
8430365 its all about one thing creative problem solving to get the story out
8430366 the challenge is about taking things that are infinitely complex and making them simpler and more understandable
8430367 the product is the brand you build brand in our industry through the product and the experience
8430368 design is always about synthesis synthesis of market needs technology trends and business needs
8430369 it is not unusual for players to be tested more than once it is not unusual for players to be tested more than once in a short period of time
8430370 the methodology we use in testing afl players is no different to that used in olympic sports and other professional sports
8430371 i was at the gabba four times and tested the same afl player three times
8430372 in rugby league i have seen the same players get tested again and again and again
8430373 perhaps jason akermanis is right from what i saw there is a very very good chance he was right
8430374 over the years ive had a few every now and then but no more than any other player
8430375 the afl has full confidence in the testing regime undertaken by asada
8430376 asada is the peak government body that tests not only the afl but every one of the 90 sports in australia
8430377 i asked the asada guy the other day if it was random testing how i could have been chosen three times in a row
8430378 all he said was that it was asadas directive to test the same three guys again
8430379 are they testing the same guys because they know we will come up negative and it will make the numbers look good by now i am starting to wonder
8430380 it makes no sense to me and this is my most important point they are never going to catch anyone if this is the way they are going to test people in any competition let alone ours
8430381 there are so many apparent anomalies with drug testing in footy
8430382 that doesnt include the jobs that happen when you come home from work those jobs quite frankly that still fall predominantly on the laps of women things like getting the laundry done making dinner nutritious dinners because you cant just make a dinner its got to be a nutritious dinner grown with good fresh clean food that takes time trust me
8430383 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
8430384 if i pick one theres no disrespect to the other bloke i think if i have to pick one i think id be picking buddy ahead of garry yeah i would
8430385 and i love gary as well i do im fond of his old man as well and garys a superstar
8430386 but i dont know what else buddy can do to win the mvp hes unbelievable they cant have a draw can they
8430387 gary is the best midfielder and buddy is the best forward as i said its very difficult
8430388 its a toss of coin really but i think buddy can improve a lot more and if i have to pick between the two i reckon buddys goalkicking inaccuracy hurts him in a toss of a coin
8430389 gary is at the highest level of midfielders he is at the elite elite level judd and diesel have set a pretty high standard and i think gary is still behind those two
8430390 thats not to say he wont be as he gets older hes going to get better
8430391 i always favour a big bloke over a little bloke but ive seen him play this year where he has been unstoppable
8430392 hes become even more valuable because he is almost impossible to tag
8430393 if you had any knock on buddy it is that his kicking is still suspect thats the only thing
8430394 the other bloke ablett doesnt have a gap in his game
8430395 hes complete as any who plays midfield hes an inside midfielder an outside midfielder he carries the ball kicks goals
8430396 who wouldve thought wed ever be comparing him to his father but hes actually more creative than gary sr
8430397 agora eu acho que hora de agir mas vou agir minha maneira n o vou de maneira nenhuma ferir a constitui o que n o me permite devolver pura e simplesmente as medidas provis rias n o vou compreendo o apelo fazer que votem contra ou a favor de alguma medida provis ria

8430409 im just waiting to see who will be the first pundit to say with a straight face that hillary clinton still doesnt mean it
8430410 why are you screaming fujimori you idiot at the teevee
8430411 because matthews just said that nowhere in europe or south america had any country elected someone of a minority ethnic group and thats what makes america great fujimoris who i could think of off the top of my head
8430412 is actually a good song for obama says see benjamin together how long did that take us 25 seconds the air vacuum inside matthews head where actual information could be stored is quite large cleek says mccain could actually use born in the usa as his song and it would almost fit for a change usa and therefore eligible for the presidency
8430413 as you might expect theyre all up in arms about the roll call im not quite sure exactly what they were objecting to except of course the outcome
8430414 the air vacuum inside matthews head where actual information could be stored is quite large
8430415 what are the chances that clinton comes out to the band playing
8430416 why are you screaming fujimori you idiot at the teevee
8430417 because matthews just said that nowhere in europe or south america had any country elected someone of a minority ethnic group and thats what makes america great fujimoris who i could think of off the top of my head
8430418 mccain was in a pow camp when bill clinton was writing letters to his rotc commander trying to get out of the draft
8430419 before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8430420 people around the world have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8430421 well its only third degree burns there are at least 95 more degrees before you get to normal so obviously shes not that committed to supporting obama
8430422 he couldnt find his ass with both hands and a map
8430423 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden on to hard pressed british families and businesses
8430424 its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8430425 the taxpayers alliance figures are seriously flawed because they are based on a discredited approach to calculating the cost of climate change and in fact green taxes have fallen as a proportion of overall taxes since labour came to power
8430426 green taxes are one of the key policies needed to prevent dangerous climate change that would cost the uk billions of pounds and ruin lives
8430427 until one is committed there is hesitancy the chance to draw back always ineffectiveness that the moment one definitely commits oneself then providence moves too all sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred a whole stream of events issues from the decision raising ones favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would come his way whatever you can do or dream you can begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it
8430428 i expect this campaign to continue to build steam right through the general election
8430429 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
8430430 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
8430431 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
8430432 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

8430437 i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and i move that sen barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation
8430438 manpower and visible presence will always be the foundation of our business
8430439 but it was obvious that as soon as ip based cctv systems became available we could offer our clients an holistic solution at an affordable price whilst meeting our goals of deterring criminal activity and preventing any incidents in our patrolled areas
8430440 the average crime incident per client rate in the areas in which we operate typically fell from 11 7 to only 1 1 within 2 3 months of the cameras being installed which demonstrates how successful the indigovision cctv system has been
8430441 these compelling statistics are generating great interest with potential clients so we anticipate adding many more cameras to the system in the near future css is extremely pleased with the results achieved through implementing the indigovision solution
8430442 i can see why so many third base coaches send runners
8430443 the chances of a perfect throw are very slim it was one of those times it hit catcher right in the chest
8430444 i dont like this place i dont know what it is about this place but they play us tough
8430445 in my mind he was going to have to come over me to score that run
8430446 that was obviously a big play just to hold them off
8430447 that was huge im sure he feels wonderful i feel good for him
8430448 usually i pride myself that if we score some runs i dont give up the lead that wasnt the case today
8430449 im thankful the guys picked me up and picked the team up
8430450 an attack combining a number of traditional attack methods like a worm a trojan horse and a keylogger
8430451 theres no way im making 145 pounds ever i dont see that happening
8430452 ive never heard that from anybody i do not plan on moving in weight class or organization im happy with where im at
8430453 at the same time thats what keeps me motivated to train harder and harder if you have easy fights its kind of hard to push yourself the more you get challenged the more you challenge yourself in the gym
8430454 i just think it comes down to the way i am and the way i compete even before i was part of the ufc
8430455 and as soon as i became a part of the ufc i made sure my manager told them straight up and down i want to fight stiff competition the more challenges i have the better
8430456 purdues administration have a lot to answer with how they treat people unfortunately bullies win until someone stands up to them
8430457 weve refined our manufacturing techniques and redesigned our low density ssds to get what the low priced pc market is looking for in the way of improved cost performance and availability
8430458 when we did an open workout there about 4 000 people showed up to watch me train at a mall
8430459 you can take it from there i speak the language i get along with everybody well i understand the people in the philippines and their struggles i just keep it real with them and they love the fact that im down no matter how big or small i am in the fight im going to be fighting and they love it i just feed off the energy so its kind of like a cyclical thing with them as much as they give me i give it back to them
8430460 yeah about 4 000 people showed up it was ridiculous
8430461 the ufc was like i cant believe theres this many people here they said they arranged this in 10 days and this is how many people showed up
8430462 man to be able to fight in front of my parents own country and have them watch in araneta coliseum where the thrilla in manila took place that would mean a lot to me
8430463 i dont know that might even mean more than any titles because its home i guess thats a super big deal if the ufc is down to going to the philippines im for sure down
8430464 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8430465 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8430466 theyre flying me out six days after the pulver fight to mexico city to do a press conference and to make a huge announcement
8430467 as i understand it both urijah and i are going i think both of us just need to hold up our ends of the bargain on sept 10
8430468 so yeah you essentially hit the nail on the head
8430469 if i can do to pulver what i have planned and what we think im going to do which is finish him were going to turn back and say hey we finished him in less than three rounds and urijah didnt finish him in five
8430470 we have styles that work well for the fans i dont think jens knows how to back away i dont know how to go in reverse its going to be one of those fights that is beautiful on paper and its going to be one fans dont want to miss
8430471 growing up i was always taught that if you dont put your hand in the cookie jar you dont get in trouble
8430472 but the legal system is a little different if youre too close to the cookie jar something can go wrong and thats what happened in my case
8430473 i had a bunch of friends that were taking different avenues in life
8430474 it had to happen to me for me to see what could actually happen
8430475 my little brothers they think im like a superhero yeah thats my brother everywhere they go they tell people about me and stuff like that it was just terrible for my family but they were always supportive they didnt let me get down on myself
8430476 they said they would give me a big fight as soon as i come back
8430477 in preseason they have to play and get ready to go but you just kind of hold your breath all the time last week there were some really good players that got hurt around the nfl and you just hope it doesnt happen to you
8430478 oh i was surprised i didnt know what was going on
8430479 i mean its pretty bad hes a young man and hes got a back like mine
8430480 itll determine the extent of the damage theyre saying four to six weeks of physical therapy
8430481 he beat bobby once before in a non title fight
8430482 but they fought on the last show and ruiz lost to bobby but it was a five round fight and its not like he was dominated anthony fought hard
8430483 im sure they wanted the title shot they were supposed to have but what can you do im sure they wanted to fight the best bobby possible because it makes it a legitimate title shot
8430484 tavitas a lot better in year two in the system than he was in year one
8430485 i expect him to be even better a month from now four months from now and a year from now tavita has an excellent grasp of the offense
8430486 the number one thing you would have to say is the difference in lyle from this year to last year is confidence
8430487 that then relates right into speed of play and decision making understanding and the ability to take something that has happened and transform it into a positive
8430488 ever since we found out he was granted his redshirt year weve been doing great things
8430489 hes been able to help me help him out and the rest of the offense hes doing a great job of being one of the leaders out there and having him back in the offense is something special
8430490 with stanford they have a new defensive coordinator wed like to see them play before we play them we cant do that in some ways its a little bit of a mystery going in and its a conference opponent you put all that stuff together and it makes for a very interesting start
8430491 last year we had some big wins but were no way satisfied
8430492 those games only showed the potential we have were all confident that we can be one of the top teams in the pac 10 we can build on what it feels like to win big games beating cal was big to drive off of and look forward
8430493 trabalhei no primeiro jornal computadorizado do brasil o di rio catarinense e l existia essa mesma discuss o para usar o computador tenho que ganhar mais o sindicato dizia que o cara era jornalista e n o analista de sistemas se fosse para aprender a usar o computador teria que ganhar mais mas esse debate passa
8430494 the extended term would benefit performers who could continue earning money over an additional period a 95 year term would bridge the income gap that performers face when they turn 70 just as their early performances recorded in their 20s would lose protection they will continue to be eligible for broadcast remuneration remuneration for performances in public places such as bars and discotheques and compensation payments for private copying of their performances
8430495 the case for an extension of the copyright term in sound recordings to be weak
8430496 t he authors of this study are not convinced by the arguments made in favour of a term extension
8430497 we have seen no evidence that living artists as a whole would benefit decisively from an extension of exclusive rights held by record companies the benefits will fall to those who need it least already wealthy performers and their estates and record companies in fact in as much as innovative musicians are users of existing recordings their artistry will be hindered not enabled by extension
8430498 as you are certainly aware one of the aims of the better regulation policy that is part of the lisbon agenda is to increase the transparency of the eu legislative process by wilfully ignoring scientific analysis and evidence that was made available to the commission upon its own initiative the commissions recent intellectual property package does not live up to this ambition in doing so the commission reinforces the suspicion already widely held by the public at large that its policies are less the product of a rational decision making process than of lobbying by stakeholders this is troublesome not only in the light of the current crisis of faith as regards the european lawmaking institutions but also and particularly so in view of european citizens increasingly critical attitudes towards intellectual property
8430499 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8430500 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8430501 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8430502 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8430503 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8430504 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8430505 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8430506 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8430507 peter would like to play if his health will permit him right now hes working on his health issues related to his foot and theres nothing new on that
8430508 it hasnt progressed to the point where were in serious discussions with the team
8430509 a further check of the driver and vehicle disclosed 1 2 ounces of crack cocaine and 1 400 in cash
8430510 looking back at the custom bike world it was such a contrast it was almost nauseating so experiencing the performance world made me want to build a bike that could balance both worlds
8430511 about two years ago i planned this machine and built it to do things its like late 50s early 60s sort of caf racer crossed with modern custom sports bike but with modern techno harley and a lot of high tech thrown in this simple little sketch that i made on an airplane it was a bike that had a look to it it was also a look that no one had really delved into before
8430512 it runs just a front cylinder and where the cylinder of the v sits i run the supercharger harleys themselves are fun to work with but to take half of one was even a bigger challenge theres something fun in making a machine go fast that really is not supposed to i figured it would either be a grenade or wed get it to work quite well
8430513 we barely start with any factory parts at all its building a bike from a clean sheet of paper on this motorcycle everything from the kickstand to the frame all the body is all hand made the wheels are specially made the hubs for instance i started with 96 pounds of aluminum material and manually machined it down to an 18 pound hub i mean youre building everything
8430514 the industry has had a lot of negative exposure most notably the show orange county not to slam them they do their thing and they have their place but they will never really be considered bike builders its entertainment its an alternative to watching temptation island its not about bike building its not about informing or educating or showing people how things are done its about silly drama thats a whole different thing and we dont like to be associated with that in any way
8430515 part of it is i didnt really push it because thats not how i roll i always sort of had this idea that this is my work and if you like it great if people pick up on it thats awesome and if not thats fine too i let my work speak for itself and thats worked for me im really not the self promotion kinda guy
8430516 im looking at buying a few and putting them in our cars i think it would be advantageous for our members as investigators
8430517 it will make not only the person being stopped but also our members more accountable for their actions
8430518 we actually have many very innovative ideas in kelowna and are leading edge in many ways that is somewhat pleasing because people are continually picking my brain about what were doing because word has spread that weve had some success especially in the downtown core
8430519 the fact is that a very small percentage of people are responsible for over 50 of the crime probably five per cent of the people account for committing 50 of the crime we have to find some legislation to deal with keeping prolific offenders behind bars
8430520 were all struggling trying to find members to become police officers its getting to a critical stage that people dont want to join police organizations anymore
8430521 the election office is now up an running out of the city clerks division and were here to answer any questions potential candidates or electors may have
8430522 during the next two years the province will continue to work with local elected officials and first nations to ensure any new information about the potential impact sales may have on water quality and the ability to expand the reservoirs is reviewed
8430523 i would have preferred they said it was over and done with but theyve agreed to back off now we all have a chance to say no
8430524 the way it is today the impact on reservoir lakes is low theres no year round residency and we have to protect those watersheds so there was concern that the government would be reselling the lots and development would take place
8430525 its very good news weve always said that its not just a matter of water quality but also quantity we do need the storage studies and im certainly pleased to see that they are not making any moves until we get more information to them
8430526 taking part in something like is something ive wanted to do for a long time but i had to wait until i had the time to devote my full attention to it i decided this year was the best chance id get
8430527 i struggled with body image while in high school i really feel into the trap of wanting to be super skinny it weighs on you and it weighs on everyone at some point i know what its like to have a good day be dependant on getting a smile from the boy you like and if that doesnt happen having it turn things upside down
8430528 i want to tell them to not hold back on doing something just because they are afraid they might fail failing is not the worst thing that could happen i was very afraid to get on the stage and answer questions but i did it and im glad that i did even if i hadnt been crowned i still have the knowledge that i tried
8430529 after the process to be selected miss kelowna was over the road to miss canada was nine days long we were watched by the judges every step of the way because someones true personality comes out after spending more than a week travelling around in a small bus the judges had a hard task because any of us woman would have been a good choice
8430530 unfortunately my family wasnt able to travel to ontario to watch the final selection actually a lot of us didnt have any family there to witness the event because it was just too expensive for them to travel so we cheered each other on when i made the top three the other girls prayed for me because they knew that was really important to me
8430531 not ready 08 presser in denver colorado counterprogramming the democrats
8430532 with the rising awareness of the problem has come mounting concern about the access to treatment and whether enough combat veterans are receiving the help that is available to them having cut way back in the 1990s as the population of veterans declined the veterans health administration says it is expanding its alcohol and drug abuse services but advocacy groups and independent experts including members of a pentagon mental health task force that issued its report last year are concerned that much more needs to be done in may the house and senate passed bills that would require the veterans agency to expand substance abuse screening and treatment for all veterans
8430533 for active duty service members the military faces a shortage of substance abuse providers on bases across the country while its health insurance plan tricare makes it difficult for many reservists and their families to get treatment
8430534 research has shown that the likelihood of mental health problems rises with the intensity of combat exposure in a recent rand corporation study one in five veterans of iraq and afghanistan reported symptoms of combat stress or major depression in turn service members with such problems more often report heavy drinking or illicit drug use nytimes com
8430535 in part this dynamic is rooted in the warrior code trained to be tough and ignore their fear many combat veterans are reluctant to acknowledge psychic wounds or they worry that getting help will damage their careers
8430536 the military generally discharges them arguing that they can no longer do their jobs and refers them to veterans clinics however some experts argue that the military should treat some who started using drugs after fighting in war
8430537 the army has increased its substance abuse budget from 38 million in 2004 to 51 million this year
8430538 indonesia does not need to apply a moratorium on its forest gapki strongly rejects the forest conversion moratorium idea
8430539 if we stop expanding our business many rich nations will be happy because then they dont need to take action to tackle global warming we dont want to be the good boy
8430540 the palm oil industries should not take advantage of the poor governance of our forests
8430541 i have a thing for pizza and this is my once a week have to have pie i always finish with a cannoli i cant have one without the other
8430542 im a recent convert to meat and when i first tried these crunchy crisp super juicy tacos i realized what i had been missing
8430543 the old woman from guanajuato mexico who works in the kitchen is really slow and it takes forever to get your food but these sopes made from masa and filled with pulled chicken lettuce queso fresco beans and housemade salsa are so worth it
8430544 i dont usually like fruity cocktails but if im having a bad day it gets a whole lot better after a couple of these
8430545 i find myself thinking about this soup all the time i love its velvety texture and spicy sour flavor it feels light and healthy and is a nice counterpoint to the greasy fried scallion cakes they serve that i also crave
8430546 he was ahead of his time and he did everything himself
8430547 the peace ship is a project of the people we hope through this station we will help relieve the pain and heal the wounds of many years of suffering of the people of the middle east

8430556 a import ncia de uns jogos ganhar uma medalha de ouro nesta competi o bvio que ajuda a ser mais reconhecido mas tentei estar sempre o mais consciente reflectir a s s e com o meu treinador isto muito importante para o futuro que existem mais desafios
8430557 a minha atitude quando soube o que se passou foi pedir calma a todos quando as provas n o correm bem normal que as pessoas n o se exprimam da melhor maneira o marco n o merecia ser t o mal interprado assim foram os seus primeiros jogos eu tamb m estive em atenas sem grandes resultados e agora trouxe uma medalha a vanessa tamb m aprendeu na gr cia preciso ganhar experi ncia feriram um atleta que ainda nos vai dar muitas alegrias
8430558 tive sempre um pouco parte tentei estar afastado do que se dizia l e c antes da minha prova quase tudo me passou ao lado s soube do epis dio do marco porque me dissera
8430559 toda a equipa se reuniu para me apoiar fiquei muito feliz houve grande esp rito de uni o e isso ajudou me imenso para poder dar este presente a todos

8430562 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8430563 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8430564 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8430565 weve had two powerful women speak back to back on each night michelle obama and hillary clinton
8430566 this has been a joy we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time trying
8430567 we will leave denver united my goal is that we win in november
8430568 we mark the 45th anniversary of the great march on washington for jobs and freedom in addition to i have a dream youll hear a variety of other voices reflecting the lost memory that the march was the result of a diverse coalition of leadership and that kings was one of voice of many and snippets of music by joan baez bob dylan marian anderson odetta and peter paul and mary will break through i am sure obama will wait to deliver his speech until our program ends
8430569 i dont see these changes making a dramatic difference in how the whole fannie and freddie fiasco plays out
8430570 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
8430571 most managers are taking the position that it would unthinkable to imagine a scenario where the government wouldnt back the debt
8430572 the end result is probably going to be that they go bankrupt and the government nationalizes the function
8430573 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb

8430579 the individual counts for nothing his class situation for everything
8430580 going through withdrawal over here very painful do your duty and post something man
8430581 he has tremendous athletic ability but can block in the trenches he can catch and run like very few people
8430582 in his eyes hes saying im the new model of tight end taller slimmer faster
8430583 you let the defensive player get under you you lose the battle
8430584 i dont think theres a tight end like him in the country
8430585 he knows whos the boss i dont care how big he is
8430586 i cant even keep groceries in the house i work for gasoline and to feed morrell
8430587 i dont think he would get on a skateboard now
8430588 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8430589 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8430590 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8430591 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8430592 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8430593 my dad who fell on hard economic times always told me champ when you get knocked down get up
8430594 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8430595 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8430596 barack obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8430597 there are some folks who will still hold out but anyone who thinks hillary clinton and john mccain have anything in common is crazy
8430598 im going to do what hillary told me to do
8430599 i am not telling you what to do because you have come here from so many different places having made this journey
8430600 the hurt some of us may feel will be so much worse if john mccain is president of the united states
8430601 ill support obama but my hearts not in it my heart is with hillary its difficult but ill abide by her orders
8430602 we need to hear something more specific before i can say ill vote for him
8430603 no doubt in my mind that shell be the president of the united states one day

8430620 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8430621 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8430622 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8430623 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8430624 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8430625 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8430626 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8430627 well location is more important to me than the doctor i mean they all were fine with me but i prefer dr m

8430631 all sample surveys and polls whether or not they use probability sampling are subject to multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate including sampling error coverage error error associated with nonresponse error associated with question wording and response options and post survey weighting and adjustments

8430638 young people aged 15 to 29 are the most affected with 25 percent of women and 17 percent of men in that age group attempting suicide
8430639 it probably has something to do with the situation of young people in greenland where school isnt always up to standards a high proportion of parents are also unemployed or have alcohol problems and theres a lot of sexual abuse of children
8430640 if we look at actual deaths by suicide there are some 45 to 50 each year these figures are very high among the highest in the world
8430641 suicide attempts are twice as common among women but men more often succeed at their attempts

8430653 some parents whose children have gender identity issues are already angry about the fact that few professionals have been invited from abroad
8430654 the dutch data on gender suspension looks promising but they have not been doing it for so many years that you have long term follow up
8430655 making mental ill health in prisons an even bigger problem
8430656 it is inevitable that prisoners in huge jails far from home will lose touch with their families and friends and end up leaving prison rootless and unskilled
8430657 the more prisoners there are the more ex convicts you will end up managing this countrys very high reconviction rate shows that prisons are currently failing to rehabilitate convicts while often destroying families and jobs
8430658 titan jails are a bad idea but it would be equally wrong to ignore the state of prison overcrowding we must address this problem and we cannot simply empty our jails of serious or repeat offenders
8430659 the right way forward is to build smaller local prisons with a new focus on reducing re offending and in this way arrest the growth in prisoner numbers
8430660 titan prisons will be a titan nightmare for those communities unfortunate enough to have these massive complexes built on their doorstep
8430661 over the course of the year the communities near titan jails will see thousands of prisoners spat out of the gate with no prospect of sensible and safe resettlement
8430662 quite frankly these are perfect market conditions for the drug trade and will inevitably result in local crime and disorder
8430663 the government is on the verge of making a massive costly and hugely damaging mistake that will destabilise the criminal justice system for years to come said juliet lyon the trusts director
8430664 giant us style prisons may be easier to build but all the evidence here and abroad says the price we would pay in running them and in higher re offending rates is far too high
8430665 we believe that investment in community sentences and in smaller units for those who need to be in custody especially for women and children are better ways of solving the prison crowding problem than building titan prisons
8430666 love love love poetry from the heart soul amp voice of love
8430667 last place and get swept by that team theyre hitting at the right time and they made the right pitches at the right time
8430668 we kind of just have to go back to the drawing board
8430669 hes been pitching and been battling out there unfortunately he didnt get the win but he threw an outstanding game he has nothing to complain about
8430670 it seems like all our games he has to pitch were not getting too many hits early on
8430671 hes got to be perfect which he was then we get a little bit of a lead for the first time in a while in his games and then pretty quickly it was 4 3
8430672 im not going to say it was a bad pitch
8430673 it was down and he hit a home run i was still winning the ballgame i got through the inning and we were still winning so thats all that matters
8430674 hes our best guy off giles we just had to make a better pitch to gerut there i think it was a slider that just kind of stayed in the middle so hes our freshest arm at the time he just got some balls up
8430675 weve been through several periods like this this year where weve had to respond and we have
8430676 our division hasnt played great our record doesnt look great but weve responded weve had a lot of games where weve been heartbroken this year
8430677 i didnt foresee getting swept here with those three pitchers but we have to deal with it weve got to move on
8430678 with search users type what they want to find with ubiquity they type what they want to do
8430679 i think it will help for a certain class of users the power user the technically minded user
8430680 now its possible it could be a foundation on which others can build and package and create solutions for a broader audience its going to evolve and others will build on it but right now and for the near future it will be a niche tool for the more skilled user
8430681 there have been a lot of other attempts to do mash up internet explorer 8 has web slices google has a mash up editor yahoo has pipes but they dont allow consumers to manage the flood of content on the web were being inundated with more and more web content so any tools that can help manage and consolidate data from the web is always helpful

8430684 after a while viper became an icon of its own
8430685 then it has to justify itself on a product and marketing basis
8430686 viper has a small loyal buyer base but like its motown brethren chrysler appears incapable of supporting a niche product
8430687 its another sign that theyre becoming more of a marketer
8430688 no se trata de censurar ni de castigar sino de poner la lupa a lo que sucede en las canchas con hinchas jugadores rbitros periodistas y sistematizar la informaci n para realizar acciones de prevenci n y poder exigir que se cumpla la ley y que por ejemplo los rbitros detengan el partido cuando se produzcan actos de discriminaci n creemos que muchas situaciones de discriminaci n engendran hechos de violencia y que los cambios culturales son posibles

8430699 i am continuing to serve the oath i took which is to support and defend the constitution of the united states then and now
8430700 this is my way of looking after my friends who are still there
8430701 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8430702 i think the consumer can be well assured that we have taken all precautions to make sure that nothing is contaminated after they buy the product here
8430703 in fact not only arent there any cases reported during this current outbreak but there has been some information circulated recently looking at cases of listeria for the past several years across canada and im happy to report that nunavut has seen no cases in the past several years
8430704 really theres no way just by smelling or looking at the meat that this might contain the bacteria or not
8430705 so really the safest thing to do is dispose of these meats
8430706 we are keeping yukon doctors and nurses in the communities appraised of the recall symptoms to look for how to test for it those sorts of things
8430707 as soon as that goes out its a top priority it should be a top priority for any business and government and so on just to get in there
8430708 i mean were yellowknife how many supermarkets do we have
8430709 were talking about products that are cooked we could try to sterilize everything that we serve to everybody but nobody would want to eat it
8430710 well have to relook at that and the question of deli meats to see if we need to go further in terms of controlling those kind of products in health care facilities
8430711 we dont think we have any cases related to this particular outbreak which is not surprising since vancouver coastal hospitals didnt serve any of the contaminated products that were initially identified
8430712 some of the larger expanded recall products had been distributed but were not so concerned about that
8430713 this is a band aid but i think you need a bigger picture which is governments issues around the direction of health services in the province because we dont have an adequate home care system
8430714 who actually looks after the patient there do they go back to their family doctor are they looked after by the doctor who looks after patients in that home in that situation it could fragment the patients care
8430715 i think in terms of safety we can reduce risk by having fewer hands in the pot
8430716 im responsible and my butcher is responsible and thats it
8430717 i think in terms of safety we can reduce risk by having fewer hands in the pot
8430718 im responsible and my butcher is responsible and thats it
8430719 bigger establishments maybe have the ability to hire better quality control staff that can be on staff to check whats going on and they also have some pretty incredible refrigeration systems that allow them to quickly cool the meat which does extend its shelf life
8430720 i think that consumers some anyway are saying now look were ready to pay higher prices if we can have something thats of better nutritional value and actually tastes like something
8430721 we face possibly having to close this store because we cant implement their rules
8430722 muxtape as you may know is a music sharing and mixing site thats apparently been shut down by the riaa
8430723 were in the process of putting up a dedicated repository for all of these but in the meantime here are 12 of our most popular riaa kazaa user settle 3 year old lawsuit
8430724 the biggest concern from the cfia inspection staff is simply the amount of time now they spend looking at reports and generating reports
8430725 and all of that means time off of the production floor
8430726 basically there is a transition period where you know that things are going to be a little touch and go and there probably should have been more resources put into the program at least until there had been enough time to see how it worked
8430727 so it means they dont get to go to the place where they know there is the highest risk in plant for instance unless it happens to be on that schedule for the day
8430728 it worries me that inspectors are reporting that they dont have the comfort level they once had
8430729 la revolucion francesa puede no haber sido un fen meno aislado pero fue mucho m s fundamental que cualquiera de sus contempor neas y sus consecuencias fueron mucho m s profundas de todas las revoluciones contempor neas la francesa fue la nica ecum nica universal sus ej rcitos se pusieron en marcha para revolucionar al mundo y sus ideas lo lograron sus repercuriones ocasionaron los levantamientos que llevar an a la liberaci n de los pa ses latinoamericanos despu s de 1808 la influencia indirecta de la revolucion francesa es universal pues proporcion el patr n para todos los movimientos revolucionarios subsiguientes

8430732 getting students as much as citizens to post online is easy sustaining a learning community with diverse cultural origins and social preferences is substantially more complex but not impossible

8430734 he has a groin problem so he will have an operation and could be out for 10 to 15 days it is not serious but we need to do it now
8430735 he has been playing some games in pain not being 100 fit and we decided that this was the best moment for the operation
8430736 he had a problem for the first game with liege and also when he went away to play for england in their friendly last week against the czech republic
8430737 we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain but now we will have to get the situation solved
8430738 we remain strong in our belief that fundamentally the ets is still just an emissions trading scheme when what is required is an emissions reduction programme
8430739 a 2 reduction in emissions over ten years is simply fiddling while rome burns the time for scheming is over now is the time for a programme of action
8430740 a real emissions reduction programme will require significant changes in our lifestyle but the alternative of doing almost nothing will be a lot worse
8430741 a sound programme would be comprehensive covering all industries and all gases the governments scheme is on the right track in that respect
8430742 but a scheme worth supporting would also be fair to all industries and consumers and transparent so everyone can see how the costs and credits have been allocated
8430743 pollution is a cost of business that should be identified at source and that business must be held responsible
8430744 instead we have deferred liability and masses of free credits going to the biggest industries and the worst polluters for years to come this negates any incentive for them to make changes this is not polluter pays its pay the polluters
8430745 credits to assist export exposed industries to adjust to the new regime should be allocated on the basis of need not by blanket donations and exemptions to huge corporate lobbyists
8430746 those free credits could be invested by the government in speeding up energy savings and moving to renewable sources in building resilient and sustainable communities and supporting poor and vulnerable people who will be worst affected by the social and economic upheaval
8430747 the government is not willing to fully explain the disastrous consequences of doing so little to save the planet for fear of a voter backlash we have to know the truth so we can make the tough decisions that are needed right now
8430748 we are told the green party and nz first have signed up to it i predict that the concessions won by them will seem like a mere thirty pieces of silver once the full impacts of climate change start to be felt
8430749 we maintain our original position that we need a radical rethink of the whole approach this scheme represents a failure of leadership
8430750 the need to make drastic changes to curb greenhouse gas emissions is what defines this moment in our history we have no time to lose the common interest must prevail in the pursuit of environmental justice and social and cultural wellbeing
8430751 now instead of auto submitting which can be inappropriate or manually submitting to the appropriate markets most of the job is done via rss
8430752 this way you or an editor or news source can have twenty headlines with one line descriptions where there used to be an entire piece
8430753 right now ive designed a site just for news content
8430754 its designed to help new sites get a little exposure but especially to disseminate the news of 2much net
8430755 last year when we launched 1 9 we were not expecting the business it provoked
8430756 i have yet to come across any other company that is as focused on customer satisfaction as they are on continuously improving and enhancing their technology platforms and related services
8430757 and not a small part of that will be using rss to inform the media and industry
8430758 i do not think so how dare you suggest it
8430759 this is how your life can be if you bellow obscenities at anyone who isnt behaving in precisely the manner you would like
8430760 my husband the baby and i were exploring our new neighbourhood and stumbled across it down an alleyway i persuaded the baby to leave his first conker for marc i havent been able to get telegram sam out of my head since
8430761 when i was doing shows nobody ever fed me i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny
8430762 i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny
8430763 i felt like absolute shit as a teenager when i was modelling and all i had around me was people telling me i was right

8430769 account for the interests of advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership
8430770 for a year when the international economy was challenging and we have had to face a considerable increase in costs driven by a higher oil price
8430771 risks to earnings in 2008 09 are increases in raw material costs and the impact of inflation and higher interest rates on consumer confidence and demand

8430880 the structure of your hair is vulnerable to drying agents including the chlorine in swimming pools
8430881 chlorine is a strong oxidizing agent which draws moisture from your hair making it dry and brittle
8430882 swimmers with both colored hair and natural hair can also experience a change in hair color with lighter shades turning green and browner shades taking on a copper tint
8430883 the best way to protect your hair from all the chemicals in the pool is to wet and condition it prior to swimming with non chlorinated water

8430890 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 cricket is how do we make it work
8430891 we definitely need a carve out period the reason i say that is not because i want to go off and play its not about that
8430892 i want to play for australia as much as i can i want to play as many tests for australia as i can
8430893 i want the next generation of australian players to have that dream to put on the baggy green cap and play 100 test matches and 300 one day games
8430894 im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change
8430895 they might see the us dollars and think maybe its more appealing to me that i go and play ipl instead of playing for my country
8430896 the hijackers surrendered without any violence and the crew are safe and sound

8430900 i move senator obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8430901 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8430902 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination
8430903 you want to vote according to what is in your heart i am not going to tell you what to do you have come from different places and made a long journey
8430904 president clinton will lay out the choices that we face on foreign policy

8430906 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this
8430907 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8430908 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8430909 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8430910 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8430911 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply

8430917 i think our talent overwhelmed them our defense in the first half was the difference we were aggressive and got our hands on a lot of passes that along with some questionable shot selections on their part led to our first half lead
8430918 in the second half i think you have to give coach capel and his guys and the refs a lot of credit for working hard and getting back into the game its difficult sometimes to keep your focus after such a lopsided half and we may have been a little complacent we had trouble containing damon fontenot and that led to some breakdowns defensively i am proud of the way our guys fought through their fatigue and finished the game with some great execution it was a fun game and the better team won
8430919 although i am disappointed with the outcome of this game i am very pleased with the effort my team displayed in the second half
8430920 we got off to an awful start when youre 1 for 19 your defense has to work extra hard to keep you in the game unfortunately the white team was allowed to basically live in the 3 second lane the entire first half because of that they got a number of easy baskets
8430921 we felt we had a chance when it was a one possession game with a little under a minute left to play they were attempting their second free throw and the shooter blatantly stepped across the line i dont know how the referee missed that but i guess that meal the opposing coach bought for him last night came in handy anyway it was a great game and we look forward to revenge next year

8431066 i dont think weve ever had a year with that many first features were kind of highlighting that
8431067 the festival has nurtured and humoured me as a filmmaker for about 10 years
8431068 the festival is that thing that you aim for its the most immediate thing that you have to know theres a good possibility your work is going to be shown
8431069 because my film is such a low budget the tax credits for sure play a major role
8431070 local filmmakers make up about 50 to 60 per cent of the projects in the province from year to year
8431071 the community has grown theres lots of film schools here and these are also people whove also had long term writing and directing shorts careers
8431072 everyone was asking me before what it was going to be like i was like i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years i had that tension and i started to let it get to me is she going to be nice is it going to be a bad environment but when i saw her everything was fine
8431073 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8431074 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8431075 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it
8431076 i dont think we ever hit each other scratching im not going to deny that
8431077 all those people who wrote the i hate brenda newsletter are going to get mad at me now like why are you leaving your child with brenda
8431078 these new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurements because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8431079 the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8431080 are pretty convincing that were going to see increases in poverty as a result of food and fuel prices
8431081 we look forward to the harvest with a lot of uncertainty
8431082 were kind of blind for a while until we get into harvest
8431083 we expect that additional pro forma loans will likelysuffer a fate similar to riverton apartment
8431084 although the parties are now analyzing the proposed loanmodification other workout strategies remain possible including foreclosure
8431085 a stay is necessary in the civil case to preserve thesecrecy of the ongoing grand jury proceedings
8431086 kami mendengar suara dan gerakan di dalam pondok yang terkunci tersebut lalu saya menyuruhnya untuk membuka pondok
8431087 masalmeh mengaku kalau dia merawat anak anaknya dengan baik tapi saya ragu dengan ucapannya
8431088 im on the verge of losing my home due to foreclosure but there are not enough hours in the day to take yet another job my dream is to work only one job and spend more time with my children
8431089 the governor believes californians ought to have the opportunity to vote on these four measures on the november ballot despite the fact that the legislature is two months past their deadline in passing a budget
8431090 im having to cut down on food just to cover gas prices i had to figure out a way to even buy my daughter school clothes this year
8431091 the governor believes californians ought to have the opportunity to vote on these four measures on the november ballot despite the fact that the legislature is two months past their deadline in passing a budget
8431092 maintains the stability and public confidence in the nations financial system by insuring deposits supervising financial institutions and managing receiverships
8431093 the bottom line is it is a nuisance for us
8431094 the crew is working with teams on the ground to eradicate the virus and look for actions to prevent that from happening in the future
8431095 it is a shame that the revised standards have put broadcasters revenue before our childrens health
8431096 australian children are exposed to more junk food ads than children in any other country in the world and obesity levels are rising
8431097 with market conditions likely to remain volatile for the rest of this year delivering growth in the short term will continue to be challenging but we remain confident in the medium to long term outlook for the wealth management industry chief executive craig dunn who started in the position on january 1 said
8431098 while amp will prudently manage through these market conditions we will also continue to invest where we see potential growth opportunities that position us well over the medium to long term mr dunn said
8431099 m amp a can be legitimate but it would have to be strategically relevant he said
8431100 we expect margins to contract by 2 to 3 per cent per annum over the longer term because of the competitive market in which we operate he said
8431101 our capital strategy is aimed at enhancing this already strong position in the current climate increasing business flexibility to grow and further optimising our capital mix mr dunn said
8431102 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
8431103 from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand spore is an intersection between science and creativity you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
8431104 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
8431105 very out of context that quote but still 30 thats only half of a good framerate

8431122 it is a tremendous honor to have any of our players be selected for their current national team
8431123 we are delighted to have joel and victor further their career playing for their country it is our goal at psa to give every player the opportunity to reach their goals and this is a prime example as these two players move to the next level
8431124 it ought to be the employers ambition as leader to pay better wages than any similar line of business and it ought to be the workmans ambition to make this possible
8431125 bosses who never did a decent thing for their employees until they were compelled
8431126 another mistake i was high when we first met everything made sense to me then the house to ourselves that night nigel had called everyone he knew and i called a few friends too the house was throbbing bill and eddie built a fire around back and grill hotdogs somebody kept the music going strong more and more cars piled into the drive the street the field encroaching on the neighbors nameless faces most of them but when she showed up nigel and i took notice can i get you a drink
8431127 he said taking her by the arm i doubt she even noticed i was there
8431128 she laughed that faraway in love look in her eye staring at the idea of nigel in her hot pubescent mind
8431129 she asks gripping my hand tightly and looking sublime her hair shining like moonlight her skin radiant and aglow i should have told her right then and there
8431130 she zips up her bag and puts on her coat to go
8431131 no i mean smoke smoke not our fire different smoke
8431132 bill and eddie poured beer on the flames and stomped on a blanket that they threw to cover the bong on the carpet in the corner laughing until the passed out
8431133 as president i will turn to the russian leadership with that request
8431134 we invite specialists from the russian federation to take a number of posts in the new government there is nothing unusual in it
8431135 i want to stress that these countries are involved in south ossetian peoples genocide
8431136 fresh water is a product whose relative economic value has risen substantially and will keep rising in the coming years
8431137 it has become a growing source of wealth and an increasingly worth while investment opportunity
8431138 markets for water and thus its export handled with transparency flexibility and solid regulation could improve substantially the way water is managed and used in quebec
8431139 this could create strong incentives for conserving water and would allow for the fair and efficient reallocation of available water to meet our needs
8431140 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
8431141 i dont think harper has to be thinking about a majority at all
8431142 strategically this is sort of a prolonged war of attrition
8431143 you can fight a war with some objective less than total victory
8431144 would be enough to throw the liberals into turmoil and give harper a virtually free hand in parliament for quite a while and really handicap his main opponent
8431145 he doesnt like being at the mercy of others he likes to be in control of what hes doing
8431146 i suspect that theres some pretty strong or in depth party polls that are riding by riding that are persuading him that his chances are pretty good right now
8431147 there may be some inner confidence that they can move those numbers closer to a majority
8431148 i am pleased to consolidate the international oil and gas operations of longe with transatlantic which confirms my commitment as transatlantics major shareholder to provide both capital and operational expertise to facilitate the expansion of the company
8431149 we wanted to play in the champions league we have been in the semi final and final the last two years

8431195 we obviously didnt expect this series with the pitchers we had going
8431196 dont foresee getting swept with those three pitchers but we have to deal with it and move on
8431197 we want to make the other team sweat a little bit the last thing we want to do is have people come in here and us be pushovers
8431198 the first day we were here haren pitched really well and today for them to win both of those games and sweep us the off day might be coming at the right time for us
8431199 you could sense we got a little bit too tight
8431200 weve been through several periods like that this year where we had to respond and we have weve had a lot of games where we have been heartbroken this year
8431201 weve had issues earlier with closing out games its been a problem for us all year but weve always responded
8431202 we are still in first we still control what happens well be ok no one in here is worrying
8431203 as far as pitching and changing speeds thats as good as i have seen him
8431204 im not going to say it was a bad pitch
8431205 it was down obviously he hit it but the single he had in the third was the same pitch down
8431206 i play basketball and football i like hanging out with
8431207 our challenge for the smes has an exceptional list of allies in these apec economies which will give us the boost to continue progressing
8431208 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8431209 del lived her life with great compassion wit tenacity generosity and valor
8431210 she inspired thousands of us to be more courageous and energetic than we thought possible when faced with moments of fatigue laziness or weakness one had only to ask what would del and phyllis do while she will be greatly missed her legacy will be cherished forever
8431211 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8431212 i also never imagined there would be day that we would actually be able to get married i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8431213 this was a really tough game and it was credit to our players that we came through it
8431214 our priority is to maintain our status wed like to get some sort of run together and get momentum

8431225 the association between magnesium sulfate and a lower incidence of cerebral palsy has biologic plausibility because magnesium stabilizes blood vessels protects against damage from oxygen depletion and protects against injury from swelling and inflammation all of which threaten the vulnerable preterm brain
8431226 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to evaluate the effect of magnesium sulfate on the incidence of cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8431227 our finding that magnesium sulfate protects against cerebral palsy is consistent with two previous randomized trials both of which were well done and which in total enrolled over 1 600 women our trial and the two others show that magnesium sulfate can reduce the risk of this devastating condition in preterm infants until we can prevent early preterm birth the best that we obstetricians can do is to improve the prospects for infants who are born very early i think that our study says that magnesium sulfate can help us do that
8431228 the dramatic clinical results from this study of gleevec in the adjuvant gist setting are especially encouraging when we consider the incremental benefit we typically see with other adjuvant therapies for solid tumors
8431229 the adjuvant use of gleevec if approved would represent an important advance in the ongoing post surgery management of gist
8431230 we understand how complex and dynamic the kids virtual world market can be brands are looking for experts who can help them find their place in the market kids brands are increasingly focusing on the roi in addition to creating a story driven branded experience kid koncepts helps brands build a sustainable business case and implementation roadmap for success

8431232 i feel very comfortable ive spent most of the day even here on the cell phone calling people in kentucky
8431233 i have more than enough votes to win and they are solid i would take them to the bank
8431234 if greg had the votes he would have already been in it
8431235 they do want some changes and were going to try and accommodate those
8431236 they want more caucuses and were going to do that they want to avoid the confusion at the end of the session and ive got a rule change that will solve that
8431237 she is a terrific candidate and is doing very well
8431238 im very comfortable that by getting people at a national level to pay attention to this race when it tightens down in the end well be able to get some support nationwide that will really help us
8431239 it was a big game for us and the response was clear
8431240 there was togetherness and focus that is what we wanted after a result like saturday
8431241 we needed to be organised because they play a little with your patience we were disciplined and focused and we were never really under threat
8431242 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday
8431243 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8431244 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8431245 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8431246 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8431247 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8431248 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8431249 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8431250 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8431251 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8431252 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8431253 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8431254 the ryder cup has brought the best out of me everybody tells me why dont you just play the way you play in the ryder cup
8431255 as tom lehman said in america wed be delighted if monty is not playing
8431256 to get selected i think ive got to show some form i havent become a bad player im just sort of out of form and have been for the last month
8431257 but i feel very much more confident having had a weeks holiday away from the game and after practising here last week
8431258 hopefully im past the stage of justifying my ryder cup potential or otherwise everybody here and im sure that i speak for the captain as well understands my love for the ryder cup and thats how i will be remembered if you like
8431259 theres no resignation in any way shape or form i just felt i wanted to turn my game around and the best way to do that was practise up here and prepare the way that i have
8431260 im still five short but we will see thats what i was doing yesterday trying to find launch angles and all kind of fancy technical stuff that ive never been into before
8431261 i played well last week and i need to do the same again this week
8431262 if that warrants me or merits me a pick then fantastic
8431263 most of us would have liked to see him trying to qualify
8431264 every player who plays his way into the team makes the team stronger
8431265 he seems to have been on a hotline to nick for a while but it would have been nice for him to have played here
8431266 you might have thought he would have known that before he either entered here or pulled out of here
8431267 i believe it the probe will finish this year for sure
8431268 i dont know whats happening now for me i think its good im trying to think only of the tennis
8431269 i still play i dont want to quit tennis im still trying to play better and better hopefully i can find my game and my confidence
8431270 its tough to say about federer he was for so many years number one and won every grand slam this year was not so great for him
8431271 maybe hes tired you cannot be number one forever i hope that hes not so top fit maybe is level is like that of any other player
8431272 you never know what can happen at us open the top six or eight guys can now win it but i dont want to speak about my chances
8431273 the hijackers surrendered without any violence and the crew are safe and sound
8431274 he one of the hijackers said no one should move from their place if anybody moves well blow the plane your all become nothing we become nothing everything becomes nothing
8431275 we couldnt move we couldnt even scratch our heads we couldnt go to the toilet no water nothing
8431276 i was so hysterical i thought it was a disaster
8431277 the overriding message here is there seems to be a plethora of vulnerabilities where apple needs to focus
8431278 despite apples about face for support in the enterprise space this was never intended to be an enterprise device and it still is not today
8431279 apple can get away with this stuff because traditionally theyve directed themselves in the consumer market
8431280 however in terms of putting out a device thats reliable and secure rims a lot better at it
8431281 you simply cant add security onto an architecture after it has been created its like putting a band aid on
8431282 in blackberrys case security and encryption were added from the start which is a very significant advantage over the iphone today
8431283 significantly stronger performance for a year when the international economy was challenging and we have had to face a considerable increase in costs driven by a higher oil price
8431284 this result reflects improved productivity after significant restructuring with new capacity in europe and the closure of loss making plants in brazil and the uk
8431285 demand increased in asia and there was a positive contribution from the successful g cure acquisition in the us
8431286 we also expect positive contributions from group efficiency programs to increase capacity and lower costs and from expansion of composites resin capacity in australia to bring in house product currently manufactured by a third party materially lowering operating costs
8431287 new agencies have broadened both nuplexs product offering and target market and several significant development projects are nearing completion
8431288 nonetheless we are confident that the investment nuplex has made in people plant and technology will provide the platform for continuing organic and acquisitive growth
8431289 market conditions in general are not expected to improve over the balance of the year
8431290 at the same time we have suffered from operator reluctance to purchase product ahead of the availability of our new viridian cabinet and gen7 platform and a larger library of content
8431291 the combined impact of smoking bans increased taxes and the economic effects of higher interest rates and petrol prices on venue gaming turnover resulted in a significant decline in platform sales 40 5 per cent representing an unsustainable implied 40 year replacement cycle
8431292 unit volumes were the key driver with a total of 32 280 units sold up from 11 063 in the prior corresponding half
8431293 petaug20 to receive your discount plus frontline products are 5 off both of these offers expire on august 31
8431294 we are going to talk to him later this week just to get an update from him but right now we are not putting any pressure on him because he has to get that feeling that he wants to play
8431295 its not something thats preferable even to him mats has said in the past its not something he is totally comfortable with but at the same time you cant say that until youre in that position yourself niedermayer went through this and needed time and perhaps mats is in the same situation
8431296 there hasnt been a whole lot of other activity going on and i think in the eventuality that this drags on for a significant period of time activity will begin to happen and well have to evaluate those opportunities when they come
8431297 its difficult to react to speculation and im not going to
8431298 i think that our position has been pretty clear we made a significant offer and we are prepared to be patient nothing much has happened in the hockey world over the past 30 days and on a moving forward basis we are going to try and remain as patient as we can
8431299 i didnt anticipate it taking this long but this isnt a simple situation its more complicated than most and we have to accept that
8431300 i understand a bunch of these teams are going to start making moves if they dont hear from him
8431301 probably by about the end of the month they are going to start making some plan bs and he knows that he has known that since july 1 really any of these teams could have changed their minds at any point in time theres nothing in holding them back to do that
8431302 we havent had much contact with him it appears hes not interested he hasnt asked many questions about the organization
8431303 i dont know if confident would be the right term but im optimistic that we have put our best foot forward describing the situation here and describing the city and our ownerships commitment to winning so im confident in what weve done but i dont want to speculate on the outcome
8431304 i am confident that some of younger players that we have spent a lot of time with this off season are going to really push to be on this team
8431305 we have added players but i think there are going to be a couple of players who are going to step up here and show us they are prepared to play in the national hockey league
8431306 no one takes this long to decide on 10 million
8431307 generally across the board weve had a strong us dollar in the past month he said from auckland this morning

8431311 furnace brook who possesses the 832 patent put forth roughly 200 demands with many mainstream and adult online ordering sites for licensing within the past four years
8431312 the company currently has more than 70 licensed users of its patent across all industries we didnt prioritize against playboy simply because it was an adult company
8431313 furnace brook sent out an initial infringement notification letter to playboy in hopes of resolving the issue but they didnt respond
8431314 however its been my experience that dealers dont just deal weed and that busting pushers for weed usually leads to arresting them for more dangerous drugs as well

8431319 we were budgeting and everything and it was getting really close to going but the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point it was a very faithful adaptation of the first few books nearly word for word they offered me the chance to redevelop it but i refused ive learned my lesson on that front and i wont do it again so im afraid its dead at hbo

8431333 catholic groups demonstrated outside canada house in london on tuesday in protest against the deportation of us soldiers who refused to fight in iraq and sought asylum in canada
8431334 canada stop deporting us soldiers who refuse to fight in the illegal war in iraq
8431335 in the year that franz jagerstater was beatified by the pope in recognition of his conscientious objection and subsequent execution for refusing to serve in hitlers army it seems extraordinary that the canadian government is adopting this position these soldiers have every right to refuse to fight in an illegal war
8431336 now for a few updates on the home front army deserter robin long a boise native was sentenced to 15 months in jail after being kicked out of canada and returned to his unit at fort carson colo he will also get a dishonorable discharge

8431340 conway also declared that al anbar province would be turned over to iraqis iraqis under the control of the puppet government controlled by the us
8431341 there are discussions going on between the united states and iraqi government were working to try to finalize an agreement by the end of december i dont have anything new to offer other than what weve said and that we think this is an important agreement and once we have an agreement we will certainly make that known to the publics
8431342 a first sergeant a platoon sergeant and a senior medic killed four iraqi prisoners with pistol shots to the head as the men stood handcuffed and blindfolded beside a baghdad canal two of the soldiers said in sworn statements

8431346 the analysis by the times found that obama donors gave 300 000 to mrs clinton in july and 135 000 in june
8431347 the democrats nominated a junior inexperienced senator with no legislative accomplishments on his resume to whom young americans and latte liberals swarmed due to his cool celebrity like demeanor but then those same democratic leaders act surprised that middle america isnt following suit how bizarre
8431348 the meltdown of progressive blogosphere 1 0 is due in large part to major a list bloggers turning a blind eye to misogyny and sexism because it helped the candidate they supported massive fail
8431349 apart from their assertion which is false that obama will end the occupation of iraq the authors make no attempt to substantiate their claim that obama represents a stark ideological contrast with mccain in fact they virtually acknowledge just the opposite
8431350 the party is worried now about mass defections by clinton supporters to john mccain well what in the hell did they expect after the may 31 charade effectively handing obama the nomination they lost what little chance they had in the fall dont expect clinton supporters to get over it any more than gore supporters when the 2000 election was stolen

8431357 what the speaker had to say about theologians and their positions regarding abortion was not only misinformed it was also and especially utterly incredible in this day and age anyone who dares to defend that they may be legitimately killed because another human being chooses to do so or for any other equally ridiculous reason should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
8431358 an error for catholics to believe fetuses do not have a soul
8431359 to reduce the scandal and consternation caused amongst the faithful by your remarks we necessarily write to you to correct the public record and affirm the churchs actual and historical teaching that defends the sanctity of human life we hope that you will rectify your errant claims and apologize for misrepresenting the churchs doctrine and misleading fellow catholics
8431360 the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8431361 philosophical discussion of st augustines time is not relevant today
8431362 the speaker agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions she believes that can be done by making family planning more available as well as by increasing the number of comprehensive age appropriate sex education and caring adoption programs

8431393 no i was just kind of you know i was kind of i dont know
8431394 youre as scared to win as you are to lose in a way too theres a lot of things that come with winning too so my intention wasnt to throw anything no

8431399 i enjoyed it it was great from start to finish you know there are times when youre tired and youre caught in a kind of hurricane a little bit but no it was all good i was happy about it all
8431400 while amp will prudently manage through these market conditions we will also continue to invest where we see potential growth opportunities that position us well over the medium to long term
8431401 m amp a can be legitimate but it would have to be strategically relevant
8431402 businesses that are most impacted by the share market have also held up
8431403 that demonstrates financial strength and the strength of our business model
8431404 we expect margins to contract by two to three per cent per annum over the longer term because of the competitive market in which we operate
8431405 notwithstanding the short term pressures caused by markets our goal remains to deliver top quartile tsr performance over a five year cycle which means average annual growth of 15 per cent in the value of an investment in amp
8431406 our capital strategy is aimed at enhancing this already strong position in the current climate increasing business flexibility to grow and further optimising our capital mix
8431407 in difficult market conditions like these we have a bias towards holding more capital rather than less
8431408 amp has demonstrated a disciplined approach to capital management in recent years and will continue to be responsive to changing market conditions
8431409 with market conditions likely to remain volatile for the rest of this year delivering growth in the short term will continue to be challenging but we remain confident in the medium to long term outlook for the wealth management industry

8431415 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8431416 these measures will send a clear message to the world
8431417 some countries may object to what were doing on principle on the grounds that they may not recognize our sovereignty i expect that we will get co operation for the most part on reporting because i think it ultimately is in everybodys interest to ensure that there is some kind of authority in the area some kind of environmental and commercial authority
8431418 were increasing our coast guard fleet we will be increasing our capacity to intercept and detain those who dont respect the reporting requirements
8431419 these measures will send a clear message to the world
8431420 canada takes full responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8431421 as an environmental matter as a security matter and as an economic matter we are making it perfectly clear that not only do we claim jurisdiction over the canadian arctic we are also going to put the full resources of the behind enforcing that jurisdiction
8431422 everyone says california and michigan are very similar tracks but they do have their subtle differences
8431423 im pretty excited to be getting back behind the wheel of that car its the same racecar that we brought to indy and michigan we had our best finish of the year in the allstate 400 at the brickyard and we finished ninth at michigan this car has been good to us this was a new car that debuted at indy and we are really excited about its performance we seem to have hit on something with this car and weve been competitive every time it has taken the track
8431424 its been a fast and furious year with the furniture row team and the good news is that weve come a long way
8431425 we still have a ways to go but for a single car team competing with the mulitcar big dogs were holding our own and showing improvement
8431426 the record is important to everyone on this team because it shows improvement and thats what youre always looking for in this business
8431427 winning the pole at the very first race was pretty special
8431428 ive had a number of good qualifying efforts there including an outside pole a few years ago
8431429 i have a mixed bag of results at california im just hoping that sundays race will be in the good column
8431430 as soon as the lights went out and i rocketed into second to start pressing for the lead i was completely convinced that we would win
8431431 if you race long enough you will have mechanical failures thats the first time we have broken that specific part but we will certainly be doing some engineering analysis and replacements on the cars to prevent this from happening again
8431432 i would say that it came at about the most inopportune time possible at mosport but it is a part of racing i feel like i had the race well in my control and it was a matter of time before i made a move on chip herr for the lead the car was perfect up until the axle went and i think we had a great shot at claiming two in a row
8431433 my race was probably a little bit better than james had but i dont have the results to show it i made a mistake trying to gain one more spot on the last lap not being able to pull off the attempted pass for 2nd is the only downside of the weekend for me but we arent satisfied with scoring safe results we know we can win and thats where our focus is at if i see an opportunity to move up a spot or two thats just what ill try to do even if it didnt work out here everything else is very positive from this weekend
8431434 unlike james and seth my race was relatively uneventful i had a good start but lost momentum when i was pinched into the wall picking up four spots was good and now im focused on a big finish at road atlanta to get into the top ten in championship points having all three of us in the top 10 in points at the end of the season would say a lot for the growth and strength of this team
8431435 we have a few more things in development for our e90s for atlanta i cant say exactly what they are but were confident of our chances were aiming to fill the podium in front of the home crowd
8431436 we have these cars figured out and dialed in mosport was a great track for us to show what we can do and so was road america but road atlanta is my home race its the one i want more than anything we came close last year and im counting the days until i can show everybody what we can do this year well be ready to put on a show i guarantee it
8431437 this week we get a chance to relax and refocus before four races in five nights its good for everyone to have a little break i know the tsr guys are working really hard and we all want to have some success for the people at bass pro chevy and jd byrider weve had some good nights this year and a couple more here in washington would certainly give us some momentum heading to california next week
8431438 having dad finish second was pretty cool he said something about him beating his dad one night in victory lane its a night ill always remember
8431439 weve very excited about the addition of larry moore to our team
8431440 with his knowledge and experience in motorsports we feel he can be an extreme asset to the organization
8431441 we have a great team and with the addition of larry moore it makes our organization even better and stronger were excited about having him on our side for the rest of the season and beyond
8431442 its been a long time since ive been behind the wheel
8431443 i really enjoy watching chad grow so it makes it real easy for me not to miss driving race cars
8431444 chad has a tremendous amount of talent and if i were still racing it would only take time away from his program
8431445 this sunday though he and my brother doug will get reintroduced to the old man
8431446 if there was ever place for me to get back in a car its spartan
8431447 i grew up there as a kid with my folks so its a very special place for me great close side by side racing and you really need good reflexes hope i still have them
8431448 my dad is the best in my book he has a knack that no one else has and hopefully with him racing ill get a refresher course in the first half of the race and give it back to him in the second half
8431449 he has taught me a lot and ive been after him to come out and race me and to be able to show him what ive learned and now i get the chance
8431450 hopefully we all have good race cars and all three of us can battle it out
8431451 i dont plan on taking it easy on the old man either
8431452 i have always wanted to race with my grandpa even though the car i drive is his and based out of our race shop in dewitt
8431453 this will be a lot of fun for gramps and i dad will drive the familiar 42 car so he has no excuses at the end of the night
8431454 this will be a great day for my folks mom and dad have supported us all over the years to make all of our accomplishment possible
8431455 all three of us on the track at the same time wow i cant wait chad has come along way the last year and is a step away from putting it all together week in and out i enjoy racing with him
8431456 jeff has enjoyed a great deal of success over the years and theres no doubt in anyones mind he will be a contender but make no mistake though this is a big race to win and i have every intention of doing so
8431457 were still focused on winning races but the time out there seems to keep everyone excited about the next race
8431458 the armor all crew rick warner shane bowers and kyle sundby and the guys from the bass pro shop team jumped in and got me back out on the track we made the most of a bad night and put ourselves in a good position for saturday we did everything we could on saturday night the track laid rubber and we still found a way to get beside the leader i thought i had a chance at the win but we came up short because of circumstances out of my control we know we are close and well keep working hard this week is a great opportunity for us to get the armor all chevy parkerstore no 15 back on the top of podium
8431459 ive always said the greatest thing about my job is spending time with kids and to be part of a charity jdrf that raises awareness and money to help cure a terrible disease is just really special
8431460 to see this project unfold with being such a creative idea to raise money and to be a part of such an innovative way of leveraging a race program its really something that is a dream come true
8431461 this car and the weekend is going to be a lot of fun
8431462 i know for the whole jdrf organization and ford and all of the people involved with this contest and in particular the young kid that came up with the design are really excited about having the winning child and their family at the unveiling and out at the races on friday
8431463 its a platform where ive excelled at the last two years ive competed in the alcohol funny car so its a track that i know well and one that ive had some good luck at and were really looking forward to flexing our muscles there this weekend
8431464 this is indy and this is the u s nationals and its the biggest race of the year for us
8431465 we wont be in the top 10 and our points wont reset after indy but as far as im concerned im resetting our points after indy as well and were going to compare ourselves to the rest of the field to see how were performing from indy on out
8431466 were not going into test mode were not working on next year were focused on closing out these last seven races strong and it starts in indy and it ends at pomona and somewhere in the middle there well take our temperature to see how were competing with the rest of the field but this is going to be an important race to set the tone as to how our season is going to end
8431467 if we want to be able to influence events and protect our interests overseas we must revitalize the arsenal of democracy through consistent defense investment
8431468 we view the decade of 2010 2019 as critical because many of our currently deployed and mainline defense and aerospace systems will be reaching the end of their useful service lives during this period
8431469 either we commit to a decade long defense recapitalization and modernization or we resign ourselves to a diminutive role on the world stage
8431470 we cant predict where future conflicts will arise but our national security strategy should be based on full spectrum dominance

8431479 it was definitely very special to win like we did at infineon it was a very emotional win for everybody involved with this suntrust racing program because as you know we have all been through a lot this year it was a very dominating weekend for us one like we always knew we were capable of and i think it was a huge relief to everybody because we have been trying so hard to win with the new dallara and weve been fast everywhere weve been with it so far and winning seemed sometimes like it was never going to happen for one reason or another the win at infineon and the way we won the race and showed we were fast all weekend is the best reward for everybody who has worked so hard and who has been so good to continue supporting this program 100 percent i think you will see a completely different suntrust racing team in a lot of ways when we get to new jersey everybody is happy once again
8431480 theres really not much i can say because ive never been there i am excited to go there because its a new track and i cant wait to see it it will be a good challenge since nobodys ever been there to see who can figure it out the best and who can figure it out more quickly this weekend i havent spent any time studying the layout the approach i prefer when it comes to a new track is to go there one day early and do some laps in a rental car and then i will have a much better idea about what to expect when we have the promoter test day on thursday i did not really study the track layout on paper i cant ever understand anything on paper because paper is 2d two dimensional and the actual race track is 3d three dimensional
8431481 nothing at all ive never been there i hear atlantic city is not far away and thats the las vegas of the east coast right the promoters say there is huge interest in our kind of racing from the local people so the atmosphere should be great theyll have a lot to see since were racing and about five or six other series are going to be part of the program too anyone who ever had an interest in sports car racing is going to love it at new jersey motorsports park this weekend for us it will be good to get back with the gt cars racing at the same time as the daytona prototypes it will be a very exciting race finally we should be good in practice and qualifying and sunday we will need another good run a good race and stay away from trouble were improving the car more and more all the time and this weekend could be even better than last weekend if you can imagine that
8431482 i hadnt really thought about it that much in previous series before i came to grand am i had had a lot of success but oddly enough before i left for infineon i was talking to my wife and i said that its been four years since i won a professional race and in grand am i hadnt won yet this year there has been a lot of pressure on the team max and myself to get results and win races it was a huge relief to finally get my first win but to be honest my win is so small compared to what the team has accomplished ive expected to win here the team has expected to win weve all put so much effort into it but for me im a small part of the team and theres so much that goes into the effort when you look at a new car a new driver pairing there are a lot of new elements to our team plus all the issues weve had all year long to win is a huge accomplishment for suntrust and wayne taylor racing
8431483 ive seen a video of the track on youtube and thats about it its a new track so it will be a learning experience for everybody it looks like a really nice facility itll be new to everyone so i think thatll be good in a way for us since its a track no one else has driven on either its hard to see even from the in car camera just what to expect it just looks really quick and our cars been strong on fast tracks so i think it should be a good race track for us and the facility looks quite nice im looking forward to going a lot of people have described the track as being a lot like vir virginia international raceway but i cant say either way ill just have to wait to decide what i think of it until i get there
8431484 yeah were down to two more races its felt like an eternity since we started the season but in a lot of ways it has gone by so quickly going to the new track its great because nobody else has been there and well be coming in there in full force with all of the many series grand am runs including the motorcycles my feeling is that now we know we can win again we just proved we can win again and theres no better way to win than the way we won at infineon we dominated from the beginning of practice we won the pole we won the race and we got the fastest race lap now my focus is to get through this and to start the rebuild of our program weve been so fortunate that ganassi racing with felix sabates and penske racing and many others have loaned us all this equipment now weve got to start replacing all of that and really the focus is going to be on rebuilding everything and then getting ready for the daytona 24 hour in january to just to continue to learn and develop this car and to develop as a team again now that everybodys got their confidence back its time to take some more big steps
8431485 just heard obama manager david plouffe s view of the world at a groovy time magazine event
8431486 hillary gave the best speech of her career it will do obama some good the only downside was that it was very generic a single tap of the word processor key to switch and replace out barack obama and the speech could have been changed in two seconds to endorse chris dodd
8431487 hillary gave the best speech of her career it will do obama some good the only downside was that it was very generic
8431488 republicans will concede that hillary gave an outstanding speech that may actually do obama some good but they will attempt to characterize it as somehow generic as indeed bill kristol did immediately after the speech on the fox news panel
8431489 finally the mount olympus set looks problematical at best an obama staffer assured me the mount olympus set will look better tomorrow

8431508 our continued efforts to focus on efficient marketing spend and to work with third parties who make their own marketing expenditures on behalf of tivo is underscored by the decline of our quarterly subscription acquisition costs sac to 135 a considerable decrease when compared to sac of 758 during the same period last year even considering that the prior years sac included the impact of the 11 2 million inventory reserve
8431509 there are a lot of legal issues that still need to be resolved on that front

8431518 i guess it says a lot about how much ground we have gained in a short time and in just a few races
8431519 we have a great group of guys to work with on this team and crew chief tony gibson and all the guys on this team have put me in great car every time ive driven
8431520 we had a really good car last week at bristol
8431521 a lot better than our finished showed we had moved up inside the top 10 and had a shot for a really good finish i guess if you had of told me last year wed be disappointed with a 13th place finish i would have thought that was pretty good
8431522 we went back with the no 8 guys in the spring and had a great run
8431523 the car was really good there in the spring and obviously the track time helps it was a great confidence builder to go there and run up front and prove that i could race with these guys in this series
8431524 ive really enjoyed working with mark the past two seasons he has been a great teacher and mentor but i feel like im ready to go out and compete each week im really excited about the opportunity to do that next season i still have five more races this year and at some tracks where we have a chance to be really strong so im just going to try and learn all i can before i get in the car full time next year
8431525 im excited to be racing in the nationwide series there are a lot of great drivers and the races are really competitive it gives me a chance to test my driving skills against some of the best drivers in the business and gives me seat time which at this point in my career is the most important part of my development
8431526 ive never raced at california but some of the other drivers told me that it can be a lot of fun its a big wide track so hopefully i will get a chance to really race hard and have some fun we are looking for a strong top five top ten performance it is fun to race with the guys up front and its also the best way to get experience
8431527 ill tell you the same thing we told everybody from day one we take each race one at a time we just try to get the most amount of points and the best finish we can get each week if you win races the points take care of themselves you just go out and take it one week at a time you dont worry about whats going to happen the next week you dont worry about what happened the week before you do the best you can when you leave the track you look at the point sheet you know where youre at you cant really plan ahead as race car drivers and as race teams our job is to go out and do the best we can each week with that attitude in mind thats how weve done what weve done in the cup series
8431528 i think the more people they add the more it makes you appreciate what youve done because you have to compete against more guys it adds a different perspective to the chase than what its had in the past
8431529 for so many years the cup series was about winning the title based upon what guy had the most points at the end of the year because he was the most consistent the chase is just a change in time im not sure it really matters what i feel about it it is what it is i think its been a positive thing for our sport but well just sit back and see what happens
8431530 it has a lot more grip in the spring because its cooler now that its hotter its a good bet that the tracks going to be slick on race day which is good thats why the groove will widen out and thats why guys can move around on the race track the way they can
8431531 they need to let the race track be you can change all the banking you want its still a two mile track the good thing is that the racing has become two and three wide and you can run on different spots on the race track but thats all you can hope for it is what it is there if they wanted to do something they shouldve been a little smarter and built a half mile or three quarter mile oval but anytime you build something that big youre going to spread cars out
8431532 i dont think anyone can call it just a southern sport anymore i mean if you truly believe that you just need to get on a plane go to the vegas race go to the fontana races go to sonoma calif go to phoenix and see the crowds i think that speaks for itself its a nationwide sport we go from watkins glen n y to loudon n h all the way to texas kansas sonoma fontana vegas phoenix its east coast to west coast now we dont just race in the southeast were covering all four corners of the united states now
8431533 its nice knowing that as a driver you can help yourself out and youre not relying so much on the car regardless of what everyone else is doing you can find a way to help yourself out it makes you feel good knowing that because the place is so wide you can move around and basically earn your money that day
8431534 the car slides all around and you have to work it all the time you have to be so focused and up on the wheel lap after lap im getting better at running with these guys for a longer period of time i just love it like i always say its a rental car on steroids
8431535 i am really looking forward to this weekend in fontana
8431536 when we take to the track for qualifying im faced with two choices i can run a solid time to get us in the race or i can go all out and hopefully earn a top 10 starting spot and risk wrecking its a challenge when you know you have a solid car so you dont want and push it too hard and screw up your chances of making the field but you cant leave anything on the table either its a fine line you have to balance the guys work hard all week on these cars gillett evernham motorsports has been giving me solid racecars the more practice time i get the better we seem to perform
8431537 barack obama is ready to be the president of the united states

8431545 we had a few police officers on the 19 man trek
8431546 one was taking and photos with a large lens of the trees and flowers
8431547 he then discovered what looks like the remains of a body
8431548 it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman
8431549 we are wrestling with a football ticket problem of huge dimensions
8431550 if we could get a stadium of 200 000 seats it would solve all our problems
8431551 our goal is to provide all ua students who want to attend the game an opportunity to acquire tickets before non students are allowed in the student section with general admission tickets
8431552 the band was the largest and most obvious group of students who because of their role dont need to buy a ticket to get into games
8431553 we will follow the same procedure as we identify other groups who fall into this category so that as many tickets as possible are available in the student section for students
8431554 it is possible that student hosts hostesses and the cheer squad could be impacted in the future
8431555 i believe this sum is fitting as you are probably the most greedy person i know

8431563 this is a great opportunity for the boys as they need exposure and to blend a combination before the curtain raiser game
8431564 the under 19 team featuring in the world cup curtain raiser is another step forward in the development of rugby league because the scouts and development coaches will have access to them

8431568 me me me i i i i did this but hey lip service we need to back our candidate though you should have picked me
8431569 it is the tale told by an idiot full of sound and furry signifying nothing
8431570 the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated
8431571 in 1922 ernest sellin found in the book of the prophet hosea second half of the eighth century unmistakable traces of a tradition to the effect that the founder of their religion moses met a violent end in a rebellion of his stubborn and refractory people the religion he had instituted was at the same time abandoned the tradition is not restricted to hosea it recurs int the writings of most of the later prophets
8431572 and lead his contrite people and perhaps not only his people into the land of eternal bliss
8431573 the palpable connections with the destiny of the founder of a later religion do not lie in our present course
8431574 only a part of those who later became the jewish people had undergone the fate of bondage in egypt
8431575 the tribe returning from egypt combined later in the country between egypt and canaan with other related tribes that had settled there for some time
8431576 a new religion common to all the tribes the religion of jahve
8431577 broke asunder into two parts the kingdom of israel and the kingdom of judah
8431578 exercised a more important influence on the later development of the people because they brought with them a tradition the others lacked
8431579 must have brought his retinue with him his nearest adherents his scribes his servants they were the original levites tradition maintains that moses was a levite
8431580 at the time of the union with the followers of jahve formed an influential minority culturally superior to the rest
8431581 the word jahve was freely used in the formation of personal theophorous names such as jochannan jehu joshua
8431582 the exodus and the founding of the new religion were thus brought close together in time the long interval between being denied
8431583 it was he and not the volcano god who had freed his people from egypt
8431584 the existence and activity of moses were transferred to qades

8431594 there are some things i want you and all wives to do no matter who your husbands are
8431595 i move senator obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8431596 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8431597 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination
8431598 you want to vote according to what is in your heart i am not going to tell you what to do you have come from different places and made a long journey
8431599 president clinton will lay out the choices that we face on foreign policy
8431600 he will talk about how barack obama has what it takes to be a strong commander in chief
8431601 this really goes against the grain of the other economic indicators that weve seen i need to get to the bottom of it
8431602 many seniors are leaving the workforce so their incomes are not as great as they used to be and we have people retiring to vermont they may have assets but not a lot of income so that may well be an explanation because we are the second oldest state now
8431603 the hijackers surrendered without any violence and the crew are safe and sound
8431604 he one of the hijackers said no one should move from their place if anybody moves well blow the plane your all become nothing we become nothing everything becomes nothing
8431605 we couldnt move we couldnt even scratch our heads we couldnt go to the toilet no water nothing
8431606 i was so hysterical i thought it was a disaster
8431607 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this
8431608 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8431609 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8431610 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8431611 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8431612 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply
8431613 mr rudd has the power now to withhold money from states that have not complied with this and the challenge for him is will he do so
8431614 sometimes then i thought i would like to be on stage with the rockettes but not as a ticket taker
8431615 for toby keith and the jonas brothers well set up 5 500 seats
8431616 in order to not insult him i said come with me ill take you to her so i took him to where he said his mother was and his mother was there in her seat with food and he pulled the false teeth out of her pocket and gave them to her
8431617 at the end of the 10 days well be tired and if you ask if well come back next year its hmmmmm but a week later well say sure
8431618 i was really surprised at how expensive books were its a lot different than high school
8431619 never saw a textbook at the one hundred dollar mark 20 years ago even 10 years ago
8431620 i had to buy a 170 biology book and my psych book was a hundred something ive spent almost 600 for the first semester
8431621 weve got a book on the shelf now that has 8 parts to it that book we can not buy back because not all eight parts are reusable
8431622 way back when editions would come out every three or four years lately we see editions every 18 months sometimes within the same year
8431623 what that does is take the used books out of the market
8431624 you have to be smart and ive been thinking about going into it
8431625 its about saving now so youll have the resources to do what you want to do later on in life
8431626 its really important for families not to assume there will be enough money for financial aid when the time comes most aid is loans and that is paid back with interest so the more a family can save the better off its going to be
8431627 i know its a tight squeeze for many families but even a little will help

8431661 they were tough they were really fighting even in extra time
8431662 talvez mais importante do que um depoimento como este em que a testemunha tem o direito constitucional de ficar calada e n o se incriminar substitu lo pela investiga o para termos acesso a informa es fundamentais
8431663 trata se do primeiro termo de compromisso firmado na hist ria do cade em que h reconhecimento de participa o na conduta por parte da compromiss ria
8431664 a conduta sexual humana deveria respeitar a seguinte ordem desejo excita o e por ltimo orgasmo mas com a supervaloriza o do orgasmo a maioria pula a fase do desejo e vai direto pra a excita o e a n o tem beijo abra o nem carinho s que eles se esquecem que o beijo um fator essencial para se atingir o orgasmo
8431665 fato que quanto maior a renda e o grau de instru o melhor o desdobramento desse assunto por m o que est em jogo hoje a quest o da falta de tempo e a necessidade emergencial do orgasmo e isso atinge toda e qualquer classe
8431666 o beijo est ligado aos nossos cinco sentidos tato olfato vis o audi o e paladar voc olha nos olhos v a verdade no outro cria um v nculo
8431667 todas disseram que j aceitaram propostas bizarras mas n o aceitam dar beijo na boca muitas delas t m namorado ou tem filho e disseram que nem pagando dariam o beijo

8431826 one hundred percent of children are touched by bullying as a victim perpetrator or bystander
8431827 in a recent study 77 percent of students said they have been bullied and 14 percent of those who have been bullied said they have experienced severe reactions to the abuse
8431828 bullying is a reality that must be recognized and addressed it is not simply a part of growing up
8431829 although there is a tendency to categorize we must realize that students may be a victim in a given circumstance and a bully in another
8431830 sometimes when a bullied student is otherwise unable to stop the bullying the victim may in turn exhibit those behaviors to others
8431831 we should not tell students to fight back against bullies the cycle of bullying and victimization is reinforced when the victim responds aggressively mediation between the bully and victim is not possible in a true case of bullying putting them together to work out their problems would simply revictimize the victim
8431832 the popular kids are very likely to use their popularity in a negative way they will use their status within the group to humiliate others and because they tend to be psychologically stronger than their peers they use that ability to control others bullies can enjoy a high social status
8431833 the evidence is clear that bullies when allowed to continue will escalate their behavior as they get older vandalism shoplifting and truancy are all destructive aggressive behaviors theres also a direct correlation between substance abuse and gun violence and bullying behavior
8431834 this is one of the most difficult myths about bullying to overcome
8431835 research indicates that self esteem seems to be an indicator of intensified prosocial and antisocial tendencies high self esteem can mean that a student can be either a positive or negative leader in other words we cannot assume that a student who thinks well of him or herself is not a bully because he or she can use that self confidence either to bully or defend victims
8431836 elementary school children who witness bullying are at risk for long term troublesome and depressive behaviors
8431837 it causes stress anxiety apprehension and other types of physical responses in children

8431855 forced confinement excessive work demands employer abuse and financial pressures are key factors pushing these women to kill themselves or risk their lives

8431881 in some ip boutiques youll have one or two partners who enjoy and are good at doing the administrative work and would perhaps be happy to scale back in client work
8431882 the make up of the people we had was not that way they were much more interested in staying in contact with their clients

8431894 the association between magnesium sulfate and a lower incidence of cerebral palsy has biologic plausibility because magnesium stabilizes blood vessels protects against damage from oxygen depletion and protects against injury from swelling and inflammation all of which threaten the vulnerable preterm brain
8431895 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to evaluate the effect of magnesium sulfate on the incidence of cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8431896 our finding that magnesium sulfate protects against cerebral palsy is consistent with two previous randomized trials both of which were well done and which in total enrolled over 1 600 women our trial and the two others show that magnesium sulfate can reduce the risk of this devastating condition in preterm infants until we can prevent early preterm birth the best that we obstetricians can do is to improve the prospects for infants who are born very early i think that our study says that magnesium sulfate can help us do that

8431913 we need to think before we speak and plan and act before we commit ourselves too deeply beyond the range and strength of our power
8431914 there is a very strong case for a bigger army and this will sound like a fudge but it isnt meant to be what we need is a defence review based on our national security not on treasury guidelines and that will tell us either that we need to reduce the commitments that we have or we need to increase spending

8431918 the man was found with some sort of knife stuck in his face he was only treated at the scene for about five minutes and was then rushed to ari
8431919 at about 11 30pm there was a confrontation involving four men on marischal street heading up to castlegate it ended up with one of them being struck in the face with a knife
8431920 we will be looking at cctv footage to form part of our inquiry
8431921 we know that the confrontation started on marischal street and one of the men went into the tilted wig pub on castle street
8431922 were looking for people who were in the pub at the time who might be able to tell us anything it was tuesday night and the city centre is generally quite busy
8431923 the male sustained significant injury and was transferred by ambulance to aberdeen royal infirmary where he remains following surgery his condition is described as critical
8431924 people are questioning it more than talking about it trying to find out what happened its really shocking whats happened
8431925 for someone to be knifed in the face is hard to imagine to hear a knife has been used in that way is shocking
8431926 how another human being could do that to someone is beyond belief
8431927 the board considered that he should have remained slightly further away from inverness if too busy to make the call to inverness atc
8431928 we do have concerns which are well known and shared over the amount of uncontrolled airspace around inverness given our proximity to the military range at tain and two military bases
8431929 there is good co ordination and liaison is of the highest order but occasionally we get aircraft such as the mirages in this case which come into the system as well as other civil craft such as microlights

8432057 moscow has laid the foundations for the occupation of crimea with years of careful propaganda its like hitlers excuse of helping the ethnic germans in the sudetenland as justification for the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1938 i have no doubt that now that the georgian conflict is over russia aims to take over crimea the level of hatred against anything ukrainian here is astonishing many people have been attacked in the street for merely speaking ukrainian you can talk french german or chinese here without problems but if you speak ukrainian people often come up and start insulting you

8432078 there is the prospect he would sell paintings on the open market it might be these it might be others if the deal doesnt come off he retains all his options as an owner
8432079 say we fail then they will be sold i cant speak for the duke i cant say which works will be sold but the decision has been made to sell a significant quantity
8432080 we are away from the table and out of the room
8432081 the price for the titians is extraordinarily advantageous for us weve really got a lot of time it doesnt mean all the money has to be in their pocket by then
8432082 its the renaissance collection thats at the heart of the national galleries of scotland collection and without the sutherland the heart is torn out its difficult to imagine it happening but it could
8432083 it puts the national gallery of scotland in a very difficult position but loans cannot go on for ever and public galleries have to react accordingly
8432084 scottish ministers are determined to do everything they can to ensure this world class collection remains on view for the enjoyment of the public in this country
8432085 under no circumstances should be allowed to leave british shores
8432086 it would be hard to exaggerate the importance of these works in terms of art history
8432087 i have loved and admired these great paintings since i was an art student in edinburgh i go and stand in front of each of them for half an hour and my knees turn to jelly
8432088 over the years the bridgewater collection has grown in value to the point where it is prudent to review the holding in terms of the balance of the familys overall assets
8432089 it does now seem sensible to consider the sale of some part of this collection and the duke and his family would very much hope that it could be acquired by the nation
8432090 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8432091 i think we need to see the united states and see the world through eyes that are younger through eyes that have dreams through eyes that see something new for the nation
8432092 i know my situation isnt terrible but i am not happy with it i know it could be better and i just need some help to get it done
8432093 i used to be organized but happened and things got hectic things have settled down now and i just need to get things back to normal
8432094 im ready for things to change i know they can be better
8432095 i dont know how to be organized it will never work
8432096 i dont even bother anymore because i know it wont do any good

8432100 theres the possibility that in maybe ten years or 20 years there will be much more effective treatments for these diseases because of these skin cells
8432101 for the first time people will have in the laboratory large numbers of nerves to study and test for drugs
8432102 its not the need that has changed it is the decisions and priorities made by labour in westminster for england compared to the snp in holyrood for scotland
8432103 the snp would rather spend money on council tax freezes and business rate cuts instead of health
8432104 at the last election labour were committed to giving every single extra penny from the spending review and efficiency savings to education which would have taken money away from the health budget
8432105 the red squirrel is one of our most beautiful and valuable native species and scotland is one of the few sanctuaries it has left
8432106 since its arrival in the british isles the grey squirrel has gradually taken over with its more aggressive feeding habits meaning that its red cousin is now endangered
8432107 to make matters worse a new threat is heading north in the form of squirrelpox lethal to the red squirrel and almost endemic in the grey population
8432108 humane destruction of grey squirrels is absolutely necessary to make the projects aims a reality there is simply no alternative
8432109 the rise of the otter perhaps reflects its resurgence in britain in recent years after almost becoming extinct
8432110 its a beautiful charismatic animal often featured in wildlife films cartoons and even company logos so its no great surprise to see it top the polls
8432111 a lot of them are often seen in and around towns and urban areas and i wonder whether thats a reflection of the results
8432112 maybe its a sign that we live in an urbanised society
8432113 i think it possibly comes down to stories maybe its because they are animals that people associate with their childhood
8432114 a lot of it isnt a physical or real or even first hand connection but its experienced through things like television books and popular culture the animals are then assigned a character so the hedgehog may be as nasty as you like but people have assigned it a character as mrs tiggy winkle
8432115 the bat has been assigned a persona as something connected with the devil or dark deeds
8432116 clearly its not a nasty animal any more than the hedgehog so its interesting how people do these things
8432117 wilkinson established a firearms factory in a small suburb of reading that was able to meet the demand nationally of the criminal fraternity the firearms have since been used in all of our big cities
8432118 this gun factory appears to have been responsible for 90 per cent of mac 10 incidents and shootings since 2004

8432139 we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steve would play in this match with the pain but now will have to have the situation resolved
8432140 titan prisons would be a huge waste of public money doing nothing to reduce crime or tackle sky high reoffending rates

8432149 how many guys have gone through what ive gone through
8432150 when i get my bike back im going to have to park it in the house
8432151 broke into their home wandered from room to room and urinated in their home
8432152 theres a confidence a strength and an infrastructure on national security that ive never seen before in this party
8432153 i dont think this is the property of the bush administration or sen mccain
8432154 we in the obama campaign have very much supported that counterinsurgency doctrine
8432155 evenness of temperament to contrast with what ill call the other candidate
8432156 john mccain is well known for his ability to lose it
8432157 we took heat for saying it but he stood tall by it as we found over and over and over again the american people agreed with him they thought it was natural strong and wise for us to engage with our adversaries
8432158 it will lead to a greater understanding greater dialogue and greater exchange i hope with the islamic world
8432159 i think that there is a role for force in pakistan and sen obama has been clear about this
8432160 we have to be honest in saying we have some interests that are at play there
8432161 the concept of quote war on terror is a terrible misnomer for the challenge we face which is a global counterinsurgency
8432162 we need to rethink not rebrand rethink what to do with our information strategy since counterinsurgency is based on the center of gravity of the population
8432163 iraq has worked completely counter to that and this is a central thesis and one of the great strengths of obamas strategy he understand it john mccain does not

8432167 itu perkara lain yang penting aturan itu harus ditegakkan mereka yang telah bertahun tahun berjuang di partai kok tiba tiba digeser dengan orang orang yang tak pernah berkeringat di partai apa itu adil
8432168 ya mungkin mereka ini hanya kader kader tetapi kan ini memilukan pengurusnya ada yang tidak terima lalu ajukan gugatan
8432169 kami tidak akan menuruti permainan jpu fokus pledoi kami sudah jelas akan kemana
8432170 pada tuntutan ayin dikatakan artalyta memberikan sejumlah sesuatu kepada pegawai negeri tapi di tuntutan urip menerima hadiah bagaimana ini selain itu tuduhan kedua juga pasti tidak terbukti karena syamsul nur salim bos bank dagang nasional indonesia tidak pernah dihadirkan menjadi saksi
8432171 we will be writing to patients who have contacted the board expressing concern about dr kerrs situation explaining how general medical services will continue to be provided at the williamwood medical centre during dr iain kerrs suspension
8432172 once the suspension has been served dr kerr has the right to reapply to be reinstated to the list of general medical practitioners in the board area
8432173 im delighted to say that the greater glasgow and clyde health board have decided not to terminate my contract
8432174 because it gives patients the choice of discussing end of life matters
8432175 im delighted by this decision and that common sense has prevailed to some extent
8432176 but i still think the six months suspension is unnecessary and doesnt serve any purpose whatsoever dr kerr is a wonderful gp he has a marvellous manner and has the full support of everyone i know
8432177 i have no doubt that whatever he did was driven by compassion the son of the woman who died even said he totally supports dr kerr
8432178 more people are taking the view that passive euthanasia is justifiable and morally permissible from there it is no step at all to moving to something like physician assisted suicide after assessment by a panel of experts
8432179 regardless of the final amount set by the court we are pleased that the principles of fair play and fair competition that prompted mattel to bring suit in the first place have prevailed
8432180 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us were pleased that the jury agreed with mattel that what mga did was wrong
8432181 it seems like bunty is a more urban version of veerappan without some of the romance
8432182 normally the low pressure moves to the north of scotland but the lows have been further south than normal so the worst of the weather has been across central areas of the uk
8432183 lerwick has been above all the bad weather so it has had sunny spells shetland really has been fizzing above the gloom and rain that has been affecting everywhere else
8432184 august visitor numbers appear to be as good as any other year but shetland like a number of areas has seen a reduction in visitors this year that is probably influenced by the credit crunch
8432185 it has been noticeably sunnier here even the days that have started a bit dull and breezy have brightened up and i have lost count of the number of long sunny evenings
8432186 when i came back to live here in may after 15 years away i made sure my winter wear was at hand even for summer but it has been far too lovely for that
8432187 pulling him and pushing him keep doing it telling people this is a sad moment and look hes not doing it
8432188 he goes i dont want to do it i dont want to do it
8432189 he kept pressuring him make him do the knife thing pulling him trying to get his t shirt off pulling and pushing him he was saying just do it
8432190 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it any more
8432191 it was an emotional time and the children were happy they asked for it no one forced anyone
8432192 if id known this would be the result of breaking the law i would never have done it
8432193 the cps wishes to make it clear that this prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims
8432194 the law exists to protect the young from harm or being exposed to harm in this case both boys were made to take part in the ritual flagellation and suffered injuries to their backs
8432195 this man not only abused the vulnerability of these children but went against the wishes of his own community as well as knowingly breaking the law
8432196 the sensitivities this case raises legal and cultural are significant we are aware of the communitys concerns about how this case could be portrayed and have been working closely with community leaders throughout the process
8432197 in short the dollar rules to the great benefit of the u s could it lose its dominion it could for real rates compare the nominal return on short term trasury bills less than 1 5 with the rise in the consumer price index over the last year 5 someone sitting on cash in the form of t bills is seeing his wealth shrink and this is before income tax is subtracted neither u s savers nor foreign central banks are willing to undertake this sacrifice forever foreign central banks purchase roughly 80 of all the new debt issued by the u s government by my calculation approximately 55 of the increase in corn since 2001 can be accounted for by the dollars decline by denying a direct link between the dollar and commodity prices the fed is signalling that it wants room to move interest rates and the dollar down

8432200 the new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurement because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries data from household surveys have also improved in terms of country coverage data access and timeliness
8432201 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one percentage point a year since 1981
8432202 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8432203 scots who like his confident and ebullient approach to leadership would be shocked to see how readily that becomes graceless bluster and bullying
8432204 attacking opponents by coining nicknames for them is a childish tactic more suited to the playground than a parliament to pretend to read from his manifesto and change the wording to pretend a promise was never made is to treat that parliament with contempt
8432205 perhaps the strangest of mr salmonds juvenile jibes came when he responded to a book he did not like by pointing out that scotlands patron saint was real while englands was only a myth perhaps he was joking but it sounded like my dad is bigger than your dad
8432206 we should confront the first ministers playground politics and confound him on the serious ground
8432207 the labour party are past masters at political insults usually directed at each other
8432208 he should try telling us something about himself and the labour party for a change rather than continually obsessing about the snp
8432209 mr gray has just confirmed that labour are now nothing more than the anti snp party with nothing positive to say no wonder they are trailing us by 19 points in the polls
8432210 we the foreign ministers of canada france germany italy japan the united states and the united kingdom condemn the action
8432211 we call unanimously on the russian government to implement in full the six point peace plan brokered by president sarkozy on behalf of the eu in particular to withdraw its forces behind the pre conflict lines
8432212 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one we need to raise the costs to russia for disregarding its responsibility we need to re examine the nature depth and breadth of relations with russia
8432213 russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region
8432214 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel the economic and political losses
8432215 if she truly wants respect and influence and the benefits which flow from it then russia needs to change course
8432216 there is a danger of having your cake and eating it of saying that you want a tough response to russian aggression you want to build a strong coalition but then ruling out so many of the potential items
8432217 having russia as a member of the g8 at a time when her troops are still on the sovereign soil of another country i think is inappropriate
8432218 this was not a war of our choice we have no designs on georgian territory
8432219 its a good thing for the party you need this clear out every ten or 15 years
8432220 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
8432221 is a fight for the future and a fight we must win together
8432222 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8432223 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8432224 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8432225 we dont need four more years of the last eight years more economic stagnation more war and less diplomacy
8432226 to my supporters to my champions to my sisterhood of the travelling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you
8432227 for someone in a minority sport to go from virtual obscurity to this is amazing
8432228 they have made the whole country proud to be scottish by what they did in china
8432229 athletes put in years of training for a single event so its only right people get off their backsides and wish them all the best
8432230 they really deserve all this in fact i think they deserve a lot more we just cant do enough to show them how much we appreciate their success
8432231 its great that this event has been put on so that we can show them just how much it means
8432232 i think its brilliant its lovely to see them up there its great to be part of their success its been amazing this year weve never done so well its been a fantastic success all round and particularly for scotland
8432233 edinburgh produced chris hoy and the council want to knock down the very birthplace of his success
8432234 its a welcome unlike anything else we had no idea out in the athletes village what was going on back in britain you get the odd text message and e mail saying its crazy but you dont take it in
8432235 its bizarre but ive really enjoyed every minute of it so far i know it wont last for ever
8432236 their success was achieved in china a country where eric liddell devoted much of his life
8432237 each of these athletes are fitting successors the scottish governments overriding priority is to see an increase in sporting participation throughout scotland the success of our four medallists can only be a major influence on our young people and help inspire the heroes of tomorrow
8432238 the achievements of the four scottish medallists will hopefully inspire and motivate our young people to take part in sport and physical activity and engender the belief that they too can succeed
8432239 i would cross that bridge when i came to it if it came to scotland representing itself in the olympic games i would be very proud to do that obviously
8432240 my concerns initially were that were scotland to go it alone there arent the facilities in my sport to sustain a team so i believe before any calls are made for a scottish team they need to address the facilities
8432241 weve got the talent weve got these athletes weve got the passion we just need the opportunities and facilities to make it happen otherwise you would be banging your head against a brick wall
8432242 there is no easy answer as to why these islands have such high levels of obesity perhaps it is because the islands are outwith mainstream agriculture and so there is more ready made food imported
8432243 shetlanders are very active we have great leisure facilities and lots of people use them all the time i am highly sceptical about this survey it is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that shetland is an obesity hotspot
8432244 yesterday scotlands olympians including chris hoy and katherine grainger returned home to a heroes welcome the scottish government should be asking these great sporting role models to help scotlands youngsters see the benefits of active lifestyles
8432245 it is important that people understand both the risks of obesity and the benefits to their health of modest weight loss
8432246 this is why it is so important that there is a funded national intervention strategy in place for the evidence based treatment of obesity
8432247 it is about looking at the underlying root cause of the problem and about empowering children to make positive changes
8432248 we are making tackling obesity particularly in early life a high priority and we have set a new national target to reduce the rate of increase in the proportion of children out with the healthy weight range by 2018
8432249 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8432250 to end stalker erotomania you have to crash their world around them
8432251 legal protective obligation smart missile or funny missile my brain my life my diplomacy
8432252 it is easier to find a war than a job these days
8432253 to end stalker erotomania you have to crash their world around them
8432254 legal protective obligation smart missile or funny missile my brain my life my diplomacy
8432255 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8432256 that doesnt answer your question at all does it i dont care give me all your money
8432257 well when you have that many monkeys anything is possible
8432258 new orleans doesnt care about the hornets new orleans doesnt want the hornets
8432259 one look tells me all i need to know but i check for a pulse anyway
8432260 even at a time like this i think about protecting that damned secret identity
8432261 in the name of democracy no one can violate the law if anybody is challenging the law they deserve to be dealt with strictly and punished
8432262 wont you be generous while taking action against my workers if you dont nobody will come forward to fight for maharashtra then it will be your turn for crying
8432263 in the election year deshmukh cannot afford to antagonise the north indians because they constitute a sizeable portion of the congress vote bank
8432264 moreover he has to send a strong signal that his administration wont tolerate mindless violence in the name of serving sons of the soil
8432265 this is not an easy task at all however i know where this meeting can take place and it can be held during the regular annual meeting of the bsec in october
8432266 i am 91 years old ive been waking people for suhoor with my drum for the last 30 years i plan to continue doing so this ramadan too if i am given the task
8432267 i drum while on my motorcycle in this way i fulfill my task without getting tired
8432268 we too were unable to figure it out the telecommunications authority press center issued a written statement on this issue but did not ask about the situation i mean youtube is not online
8432269 because the content which caused youtube to be blocked by ankaras 11th high criminal court without any justification was taken off from youtube the court decided to permit access to the web site youtube is now online
8432270 the prosecutor of the court did not ask the court to allow access to youtube no such decision was sent to us
8432271 we are still considering it what is important is whether such a visit will be useful or not
8432272 it was a us proposal for the date which is 2015 and an iraqi one which is 2010 then we agreed to make it 2011 iraq has the right if necessary to extend the presence of these troops
8432273 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention in denver or the people of colorado
8432274 it is a fact that laws that are amended in a way as if there is no terrorism threat against our country prevents security forces from fighting terrorism in a rapid and effective manner
8432275 these efforts have had positive outcomes in terms of extending the scope of human rights and freedoms but they have introduced new arrangements for security forces and considerably restricted their scope of authority in taking the necessary precautions to prevent crimes encouraged by the amendments to laws terrorist organizations and illegal formations have increased their acts and gained ease of movement to abuse the freedom granted to them
8432276 we are aware that it is a necessity to ensure safety in the country without taking away human rights but if terrorist groups threaten human rights then we believe it is necessary to revise the balance between rights and freedoms and measures to be taken evaluating the amendments to our laws in light of this necessity will contribute largely to our fight against terrorism
8432277 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
8432278 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
8432279 i will embrace all citizens without discrimination during my time in office i will preserve my impartiality and do my best to ensure that state institutions work in harmony
8432280 what the request in regards to the ruling party will make turkey gain or lose should be considered carefully
8432281 this project includes a greater vision that will positively affect welfare stability and peace of a broad geography beyond europe and turkey commitment to the reforms means turkeys real modernization
8432282 of course to provide a city with drinking water with high levels of arsenic is not a desirable thing but zmir has limited water sources the water source that supplies 38 percent of the city cannot currently be used due to drought supplying water that has high levels of arsenic instead of providing nothing is a move to decrease the cases of contagious disease on the other hand there are risks posed by arsenic consumption what should be done in this case actually there is no straightforward answer on one side are acute diseases on the other side are chronic arsenic effects this is zmirs position things shouldnt have been allowed to get to this stage if aml dam could be completed zmir would not have such a big water problem
8432283 carbon filters and water softeners are not effective for removing arsenic
8432284 if you are very picky you can use distillation devices at home but because of high energy consumption this method may prove costly
8432285 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8432286 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8432287 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8432288 we dont need four more years of the last eight years more economic stagnation more war and less diplomacy
8432289 to my supporters to my champions to my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you
8432290 anyone who saw michelles speech last night knows she will be a great first lady for america
8432291 as i recall we did it before with president clinton and if we do our part well do it again with president obama
8432292 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8432293 russia has recognized the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia mindful of its responsibility for ensuring the survival of their fraternal peoples in the face of an aggressive chauvinistic policy pursued by tbilisi
8432294 turkey attaches importance to the independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia and is highly concerned about the recent developments turkey is of the opinion that this conflict should be resolved through peaceful means
8432295 unfortunately our warnings concerning kosovos independence were ignored and an international case law has emerged
8432296 in international relations you cannot have one rule for some and another rule for others
8432297 this is not an easy task at all however i know where this meeting can take place and it can be held during the regular annual meeting of the bsec in october
8432298 the mhp is not saying anything new they have just collected our previously made proposals and those that they have made in the past into a package and they submit it to us as if it is a new package
8432299 given the constitutional courts decision concerning articles 10 and 42 of the constitution the court can cancel any constitutional amendment it is not possible to make an amendment concerning the composition of the constitutional court every step we take may lead to another decision by the court that is similar to the one concerning articles 10 and 42
8432300 in the third national program announced on aug 18 our government pledged to make 131 amendments it follows that the new legislative term will be considerably busy with respect to the eu process mr bah eli created a package picking several proposals that we had made in the past it is a good development that he came to this point after a certain time
8432301 the mhp suggests that the constitutional court should punish individuals what is the difference between that and closure
8432302 on the one hand the mhp says that this government is not legitimate on the other hand they say that they will lend support to the constitutional amendments this government will make can an illegitimate government make a constitutional amendment this approach intends to block the amendments at least the republican peoples party chp says this openly the mhp is trying to make the ak partys position disputable and give the impression that they are supporting the amendments but in reality they are trying to prevent them it does not seem possible that this parliament can make these constitutional amendments
8432303 except for the presidential election in 2007 the ak party has always sought and secured consensus with opposition parties for constitutional amendments only in the presidential elections the chp refrained from conciliation the government reached a consensus with the mhp and the democratic society party dtp in connection with the constitutional amendments that would have lifted the headscarf ban in university campuses after the july 22 elections we have never acted alone in connection with a constitutional amendment no compulsion came from our side and this will continue
8432304 this decision was intended to prevent further comprehensive constitutional amendments it placed a big barrier before turkeys course it will not be possible to remove this barrier for another 10 15 years it is no longer possible to make comprehensive constitutional amendments without getting the consent of the constitutional court or without obtaining consensus with the constitutional court as well as political parties parliament cannot draft a new constitution
8432305 they told us to use the same figure that they use their value is correctly calculated using their own methodology but it is not an ethical calculation
8432306 as a result they come up with a figure to say that if a person cannot spend such an amount of money on food s he would face starvation this criterion is used for such underdeveloped countries as somalia ethiopia and sierra leone where people struggle to live on sometimes less than a dollar a day this calculation does not take into account nonfood expenditures such as housing to satisfy basic needs
8432307 say that it is possible to live off of that amount of money
8432308 civil servants law number 657 requires employees to have clean and presentable clothing at work because they represent the government if a civil servant does not comply with this s he can be given disciplinary punishment so a civil servant should make an income to meet his her basic needs
8432309 we are talking about an honorable wage on the way to turkeys accession to the european union
8432310 ytl 255 means ytl 2 or 3 1 6 2 5 per person a day if they insist on this amount we will ask them to go out and try to survive on this little amount of money maybe they could empathize then
8432311 in the face of turkstats suggestions we now feel more empowered in public
8432312 evaluating its organizational model to determine the appropriate artistic and business management structure for the future
8432313 the lack of security precautions taken to secure important data is shocking there needs to be accountability and processes in place to ensure that data taken from a company whether it is on a laptop pda or usb stick is secured in such a way that there is no risk of it getting into the wrong hands
8432314 encryption isnt enough it is a blend of security that will keep data safe it is all encompassing from allowing only authorised staff to access the files on the network to password protection to encryption to tracking and recovery software

8432335 thats no problem excess electricity gets sold to the power company who stores it for you
8432336 in january 2007 the texas legislature convened helped win pickens a key new legal right it was contained in an amendment to a major piece of water legislation the amendment one of more than 100 added after the bill had been reviewed in the house allowed a water supply district to transmit alternative energy and transport water in a single corridor or right of way
8432337 pickens still needed the power of eminent domain if he was going to build his pipeline and wind power lines across private land and by happy coincidence the legislators passed a smaller bill that made that all the easier the new legislation loosened the requirements for creating a water district
8432338 various activities will be organized in parts of turkey by the turkish ministry of culture and tourism and the japanese embassy as part of the 2010 japanese year as our city is kushimotos sister city we decided to also contribute to these events by organizing artistic and cultural activities

8432356 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8432357 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8432358 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8432359 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8432360 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8432372 two thirds of adverse events after a heart att advertisement ack which may be a further heart attack stroke or major bleed happen after a patient has been discharged from hospital
8432373 our findings are of concern because we believe that the risk for patients whose heart attack was originally considered not as severe may be being misjudged
8432374 as a result there may be some patients who should be but are not receiving treatments such as the placing of stents to open up the artery drug treatments and lifestyle changes which could prevent a further heart attack from occurring

8432379 i dont know his name we havent got that far other than the fact that he is eastern european
8432380 its down to the community to pull together as a result of what has happened and to work with each other to make sure that any extremists are weeded out of the community

8432388 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8432389 i was pushed to the limit the last time i played her she was up 5 1 in third and i had to come back
8432390 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty
8432391 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match and be able to win even when you feel tired
8432392 when i got into a dangerous situation so i started moving her around a little bit more in the second set i was able to gain more confidence
8432393 it was a big game for us and the response was clear
8432394 there was togetherness and focus that is what we wanted after a result like saturday
8432395 we needed to be organised because they play a little with your patience we were disciplined and focused and we were never really under threat
8432396 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday
8432397 we expect bankruptcies to continue to surge past 1 million new cases by year end

8432402 solid and reliable because david hill has probably done more campaigns in colorado in the last 18 years than anybody in america
8432403 hes a very reputable pollster wholl not tell a client what the client wants to hear he tells the client what is real and what truly exists
8432404 i dont think the democratic national committee really has that much impact on my race it gives me some national recognition but im really more concerned about recognition within the distric

8432409 theres no price tag on experience and he boeckman can now evaluate things from a whole different perspective i think it is a lot easier for him to step up and take charge of a football team
8432410 matt knows our offense pretty well but hes kind of in a tough bind because on one had he makes so many plays because he is a playmaker he gets out there and gets out of jams and makes a lot of plays but he also has to understand that he has to protect the football you hope that he will do a good job making those kinds of decisions every situation is different because now he knows that if there is nothing for him down field that throwing the ball out of bounds is ok
8432411 then education becomes the single most important activity that any of us can participate in
8432412 exigi ndole a calder n que inmediatamente d rdenes como comandante supremo de las fuerzas armadas para que cesen los cateos sin mandamiento judicial
8432413 sin duda es un tema importante que comentar pero que no se equivoque el presidente una cosa es que se le haya dado la facultad de no venir al congreso no venir personalmente a entregar el informe en la c mara de diputados y otra que se utilicen los espacios y tiempos del estado para solamente platicar de los temas que al ejecutivo le interesan
8432414 abkhazia declared independence 15 years ago so abkhazia was independent already not separatist as people say
8432415 stalin attached abkhazia to georgia but we dont accept that abkhazia was already a de facto independent state but we are glad that russia has now recognized it
8432416 eighty to 85 years of unwilling unity has ended stalin is the cause of this unity ossetians faced three genocide campaigns throughout this century that westerners do not know about at least from now on no more people will die
8432417 all georgians abkhazians and ossetians will live peacefully there but as georgia abkhazia and south ossetia
8432418 we are happy now and will take it to the end georgia should look back to its own history ossetians and abkhazians were attached to it awkwardly the caucasus are not made up of georgians alone many ethnic groups live there
8432419 the single most important thing i have to make clear is the choice we have in november between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for americans and help families who are struggling
8432420 sometimes this administration has low balled the costs of treating our veterans coming home because the budget for the war was so much greater than they had promised
8432421 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8432422 we will increase the number of these helicopters to 17 by the end of this year
8432423 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8432424 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8432425 we are continuing our journey with the understanding that we build bridges of love and culture wherever there are muslims and turks with a love of brotherhood that goes beyond borders we will set up iftar fast breaking meals in 21 different cities in eight balkan countries
8432426 we would like to introduce our country and show that turkey has not forgotten our fellows in the balkans our iftar project has strengthened our ties of brotherhood with the balkans
8432427 biden may be an important part of the decision making mechanism in foreign policy but it may not be wise to expect biden to control the entire foreign policy making process
8432428 we tend to analyze what could happen in the future on the basis of past policies of the us and turkey but both the united states and turkey are changing and so will biden
8432429 all presidential candidates talk during their election campaigns but then go through a training period of six months to one year as president if obama is elected april 24 will come before this training period
8432430 this is our view on this issue first of all no people can be forced to live under another countrys oppression hence we are respectful of the will of the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia
8432431 we as the turkish cypriots have lived through similar incidents turkey was the one that extended its hand of help and who recognized us the turkish cypriots have displayed many times their determination not to live under the oppression of the greek cypriots who attacked them consequently we understand the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia very well and respect them
8432432 we have been in a resolution process our target with the resolution process is to constitute a federal structure based on two zones political equality and two constituent states accordingly our target via resolution is to create a federal and united cyprus that integrates with the world this is our current policy
8432433 we understand the desires of south ossetia and abkhazia to live under the roof of their own independent state and we respect their decisions
8432434 developments in kosovo south ossetia and abkhazia and other developments that could take place in other regions warn that this partnership state is a target that needs to be urgently reached
8432435 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8432436 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8432437 that is not impossible i repeat that it is very dangerous and there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova
8432438 ukraine could be the next political pressure point for russia therefore it is important from a stability point of view to send a positive signal that it is possible for ukraine to progress toward the union
8432439 hi my names your name and im addicted to piss
8432440 why would you say i said that stuff if you have a probem with me let me know

8432444 i think its important it go down in history her coming as close as she did to winning the nomination
8432445 thats my role in the party its my conviction about the importance of political engagement
8432446 this is not about clinton its not about obama its about the nation the nation is due for a change
8432447 you dont win elections by showing up at these breakfasts you win elections by knocking on doors
8432448 florida is a state that decides elections and lately youve been doing a damn poor job
8432449 some of you may not like what i have to say
8432450 john mccain is not a perfect man he can be a little emotional but he is fundamentally a good person i would feel comfortable waking up in the morning with john mccain as president
8432451 if you believe what we need is another four years then vote john mccain if you believe we need to take a different track barack obama will start the process of restoring america
8432452 young voters are motivated like never before young voters are working hard for the voice of a new generation barack obama
8432453 ill be a democrat at the end of the day but if you were sent here by your constituents and you are a person with integrity you stick with how you were sent
8432454 she wanted to be a hillary delegate excuse me where is your ethics am i wrong
8432455 she should have kept her mouth shut or she should step down
8432456 it seemed she was being pushed out of the race
8432457 and when they pushed her they were pushing us because we worked for her
8432458 vote for whoever you want to vote for but remember this never took place because if they hear that were divisive you do nothing but demean the democratic party and put john mccain in office
8432459 i think the fact that we havent really started up yet with media etc and we are as close as we are is very significant
8432460 the landscape has shifted in nevada and out of the early caucus opportunity the registration shift the registration shift has been really quite remarkable
8432461 and this fall we are going to pick up more seats
8432462 thats a lot of change but not the change that is needed
8432463 eighty percent of the kids we bring over get placed
8432464 weve had 150 kids adopted over the years and 30 more adoptions are in the works

8432466 i was a silicon valley sales guy for 21 years i got laid off in 2002 and a week later i was invited to speak at an adoption conference and help lead a bay area hosting program
8432467 our mission is to create an opportunity for kids to meet families we get the word out through churches the media and our network
8432468 in the past we had pursued adoption through santa clara county
8432469 it was very hard to get our foot in the door
8432470 we dont really miss russia because we like this place better
8432471 we like all the fun stuff and all the toys we have
8432472 we get doctor care and we get to go to church and we can get a good education
8432473 they didnt speak any english so we had to deal with translators
8432474 there was a fear of being sent back to the orphanage
8432475 and they would hoard food they would run out of food at the orphanage they didnt understand that you dont run out of food in america

8432478 dewitt was batting 500 11 for 22 over a four game stretch that ended on saturday but according to his day by day stats on milb com he hasnt played since not sure why but ill try to find out ozuna had become nothing more than a late inning defensive replacement and pinch runner but i would imagine if he clears waivers hell be back next week
8432479 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8432480 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8432481 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8432482 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8432483 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8432484 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8432485 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8432486 adam schefter of nfl network reported that merriman signed a contract that had a maximum escalator of 4 4 million in 2009 and he has earned 2 85 million so far to add to his 2009 base salary so if he plays this year and plays well enough to record 12 5 sacks and get to the pro bowl he can collect an additional 1 55 million next year

8432492 i thought all the quarterbacks played really well im proud of the way they led through the spring all three of those guys are good players really good players
8432493 permanent joy for all of the little this is probably why
8432494 admittedly i will always tend to vote for the more conservative candidate in any election even if he or she is brain damaged thats because individual freedom and protection of our freedom is my main political agenda thats my bias im sure the lefties approach things similarly

8432499 the build up of nato forces in the black sea area
8432500 russias actions have called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8432501 russia clearly intended this as a blatant challenge to world order its now up to all of us to roll russian aggression back if they get away with this they will carry on they will also attack other countries in the neighborhood
8432502 we are sorry about this decision for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we cannot support this position
8432503 we will see how this will develop we are sticking to the conditions on the timetable for the russian fleets presence there strictly

8432509 i do not know anything about a study bearing this result many things are written in turkey intentionally and with prejudice so i have no idea about such a study
8432510 what i give importance to here is the methodology in preparation of a new constitution people sometimes want to make a contribution that is already being made if they cannot do this they tend to criticize it even if it is something they favor
8432511 the sensitivity i showed in rector appointments is obvious i appointed 28 rectors and 22 of them were at the top of the list sent by the higher education board y k to the president one should put aside prejudices when criticizing someone it is true that one of the rectors i appointed was a parliamentary candidate from the ruling justice and development party ak party there are also other rectors who occupied important positions in opposition parties why do those critics talk about this i appointed rectors whom i thought were the best for the position

8432515 we wanted to create a classic jean you can wear year after year
8432516 when we started everything was low rise embellished and torn that was our opportunity
8432517 our customers are loyal because we are an american classic and have been around a long time and we dont follow trends too hard

8432586 davids fearless disdain of the physical distance between himself and his many subjects coupled with his brilliant use of natural light produced pictures of powerful nuance and intimacy whether posed or candid
8432587 i became a professional photographer on the morning my son seth was born
8432588 utilizing my photos and those of my mentor david gahr
8432589 it is impossible to think about americas popular and folk music of the last half century without having a david gahr picture in your mind
8432590 we spoke about this already and so i mean it ought to be right
8432591 you must know what is wrong and how to correct it
8432592 cannot stand wrong intonation i know i put the conductors in an embarrassing situation but they have to be able to do it
8432593 you dont hear what they are doing you are in your own world and you are going too quickly
8432594 you have to know the culture to know the score and to project what you want to hear some conductors are well prepared but cannot transmit their ideas to an orchestra and others are good communicators but have nothing to transmit because they are not absorbed enough in the score
8432595 but i am doing a lot of things they may be small movements but they are directed exactly to the musician who needs them and in performance the force is always more because of the excitement of the concert
8432596 you have to impose your will not with a hammer but you have to be able to convince people of your point of view
8432597 audiences follow the orchestra the problem is that performers say oh my god if i programme schoenberg nobody will come and thats not true last year with the berlin philharmonic i played music by bart k schoenberg berg and webern the literature of before the first world war and i was told by some people that this was a difficult programme i say all these works are composed before 1914 thats not new do you think in 1940 people were saying my god tristan und isolde is so difficult to listen to 80 years after it was written the 20th century is famous for being the century of speed but the speed is not there when it comes to culture i find
8432598 i can live for months without performance and i am not deprived at all

8432600 all the people with whom i was very close at one point in my life stockhausen berio ligeti nono bernd alois zimmermann they are all gone
8432601 with berio with whom i kept a good relationship we only met once a year or so and with stockhausen we had almost no contact in the last decades because he made himself alone
8432602 i also live rather alone in business in the music world people know that i can be very friendly and warm but that after a certain moment the business is closed i like to be alone in order to concentrate on my work the social life does not exist it has never existed for me really i have chosen instead the working life because i prefer that i like to work otherwise i do not know what i would do
8432603 after the mahler i will go to baden baden where i have a house far away from this madding world
8432604 call that a pardy a fella cant hear himself think in there in my day we knew how to pardy mumble mumble mumble

8432609 we just wanted to give our institutions a heads up that our examiners will be focusing on how the institutions are handling cutbacks in home equity lines of credit
8432610 there are clearly rules that apply when an institution wants to suspend or reduce an equity line of credit
8432611 our goal in issuing the guidance was to bring all those rules together in one place
8432612 september 2nd is officially moms open season to make tremendous amounts of money in home based businesses
8432613 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone

8432615 we can actually do our work in some ways we are very very happy
8432616 the only reason we got them back was because of all of the media attention this received
8432617 i have no reason to believe they are facing any sort of charges
8432618 then again would i believe that the minneapolis police would stop people for walking down the street at 1 30 in the morning
8432619 the times reports on the problems of adding wind farms to the power grid because of the grids old design it
8432620 okay for the next 3 hours this coal plant needs to produce more power
8432621 thats no problem excess electricity gets sold to the power company who stores it for you
8432622 in january 2007 the texas legislature convened helped win pickens a key new legal right it was contained in an amendment to a major piece of water legislation the amendment one of more than 100 added after the bill had been reviewed in the house allowed a water supply district to transmit alternative energy and transport water in a single corridor or right of way
8432623 pickens still needed the power of eminent domain if he was going to build his pipeline and wind power lines across private land and by happy coincidence the legislators passed a smaller bill that made that all the easier the new legislation loosened the requirements for creating a water district
8432624 it seems that he just had a pen in his hand and they started fighting and at some point during the fight he began to stab the victim
8432625 what separates poetry from religious dogma is the ability of a poem to speak across time to everyone no matter their world view

8432638 we at canadians for accountability a group founded to promote accountability and support whistleblowers were shocked and offended many of us are whistleblowers ourselves

8432642 primero hay que redactar el documento luego hay que pedir los informes sectoriales una cosa es cu ndo el ayuntamiento ha dicho que quiere tener terminado su trabajo y otra cu ndo se aprueba porque despu s depende de los informes sectoriales de otras administraciones y s lo entonces va a ir a la comisi n y luego al pleno

8432644 insisto en lo que dije hace unos meses y es que el ayuntamiento hab a recibido 80 y tantas sentencias de julio a junio en asuntos urban sticos eso es tener un nivel de litigiosidad en urbanismo elevad simo cu les pueden ser la causas pues probablemente el que no se ha acotado bien la seguridad jur dica del planeamiento anterior

8432663 the decision to deliver aid using nato battleships is something that hardly can be explained
8432664 i made clear above all that i would have expected that we would talk about these questions in international organisations before unilateral recognition happened
8432665 there are several un security council resolutions in which the territorial integrity of georgia was stressed which russia also worked on
8432666 we cannot accept these violations of international law of a territory by the army of a neighboring country

8432672 i just think he doesnt have the temperament to be president
8432673 do i have the ability to speak with experience about someone who has abused everyone hes dealt with
8432674 there isnt a republican serving in the senate thats happy hes the nominee now theyre all supporting him but ill tell you they have told me ive had republican senators tell me they dont think theyll vote for him
8432675 if you find the defendant did not abide by the rules no matter how he might have fought or how many days he spent in the military if he violated the law of war that day you have a duty to find him guilty

8432677 well melting moment didnt seem to mind too much sammy dont worry about it
8432678 im not that generous but hey its a free world
8432679 not really i was going to meet some friends for drinks after work why
8432680 hey trevor lets go shoot some heroin and rob a convenience store and trevord be all
8432681 oh burgers youre smart i shoulda made my man do that too
8432682 why thank you beth youve saved me time and money and attempted to maintain my place if not in front of at least equal to sex and the city
8432683 im just wondering how i can get in the line youre in it seems to be going so much faster than my line which ive been in for well over an hour
8432684 oh silly me maybe the next time im in safeway ill just push my way to the front and start dumping my groceries on the scanner you dont think theres a line are you insane do you actually think thats an acceptable response you dont think there really is a line well thats amazing what an amazing anarchist world you must live in
8432685 the 30 year old equivalent of dorothy from the golden girls
8432686 theyre very concerned about the consequences but the fashion of filling streets with angry farmers seems to be fading so were not seeing a very strong reaction
8432687 the new regulation will be made worse by our own new laws released after the grenelle de lenvironnement
8432688 those proud to help feed the world are angry because they fear huge production cuts though it seems no studies have been done to assess by just how much
8432689 indeed the problem with our politicians is that they dont link pesticide use to production they believe we spray chemicals just to maintain our friendship with chemical manufacturers
8432690 should society really be organising shortages like this thats crazy isnt it
8432691 we havent heard much against these new regulations from our main farm unions but according a smaller one it seems that lighter cap reform has been exchanged for farmers accepting the chemical limitation
8432692 but im sorry to tell you that in germany the topic is something of an insider debate
8432693 the german agricultural press doesnt believe the problem is as big as forecast by the pesticide industry
8432694 so well lose fewer pesticides than other countries but wheat rape and sugar beet farmers with an effective lobby will be less affected than those growing vegetable and fruit
8432695 i dont understand the idea of forbidding pesticides proved not to be harmful
8432696 further restrictions will mean lower yields fewer possible crops and substantially bigger problems especially with grassweeds
8432697 in other words what is the environmental cost of different production methods per kg of crop yield
8432698 which is better for nature a combination of very intensive farming with some unfarmed nature reserves or for the same yield a bigger area farmed less intensively combined with almost no reserved land
8432699 like many in this part of the world we are major users of older off patent active ingredients as they tend to be very cost effective
8432700 were trying to reduce our cost per hectare all the time as its difficult to improve our yields through additional inputs due to climatic conditions

8432712 le estamos apostando a una televisi n coherente que genere contenido y no que reaccione a lo que est pasando ten amos que hacer un programa que tuviera algo que aportar en la ma ana ya es tiempo de darle otra cosa al p blico y no entretenimiento barato
8432713 there can be no underestimating the impact of wilkinsons actions his conversion of imitation weapons allowed criminals to arm themselves with guns capable of killing and maiming people we have significantly disrupted an organised crime group that had been supplying large quantities of automatic weapons and ammunition into criminal networks
8432714 he was acting in a way that made the hair on the back of your neck stand up
8432715 you are talking about blood money this is not a legitimate business or legitimate money he is selling the guns to the underworld just to kill people and its all because of greed
8432716 i think he the gun maker is as guilty as the people who are using the gun
8432717 it is clear that the usage in crimes in the uk of mac 10s can be directly linked to the factory at the briars
8432718 the availability of these weapons is clearly fuelling violence on our streets
8432719 we are battening down the hatches it could be six 12 maybe 18 months
8432720 i think the single most important lesson is the speed of reaction slowing land purchases attacking costs hard
8432721 marginal projects will be put on hold as financial pressure on housebuilders intensifies and transaction volumes remain low pushing government housebuilding targets further into the wilderness a rapid policy rethink is vital if 2m homes are to be built by 2016 to achieve government targets
8432722 housebuilding is set to fall below 100 000 over the next year with housing starts already down 25 to reduce the excesses of this boom and bust cycle a more sustainable approach to housebuilding needs to be enacted sooner rather than later
8432723 i was staggered when i saw the works a new sense came upon me a new heaven and a new earth stood before me
8432724 it is the most important old master paintings loan to any public museum in the world and is of supreme importance to scotland and the rest of the uk
8432725 they could be one of the greatest acquisitions we could ever make these are among the four or five pictures which would come to mind if one thought of what titian stood for as an artist
8432726 it is really important to realise that art is not there just for the country in its moments of affluence it is a major solace for times of difficulty most major acquisitions have been made against a background of economic distress
8432727 obviously his strongly preferred option is to sell them to the national galleries the price represents a huge discount i know the duke is extremely fond of these paintings they mean a lot to him
8432728 their experience in financial services will be of great benefit to rbs given the increasingly diversified and international nature of our powerful banking franchises
8432729 they are no shrinking violets they will stand up to the board
8432730 its one step forward in corporate governance but they have more to do
8432731 he is very ambitious and knows exactly how many beans make four when it comes to banking
8432732 hester is a bit young to be chairman and british land are unlikely to let him go to be chief executive
8432733 from an rbs point of view hes a nice answer to the people who question succession planning
8432734 this move by rbs is too little too late but a step in the right direction for upgrading the board and providing credibility for the long overdue ceo search ryan and mcfarlane know their banking
8432735 when i saw chris a few days ago he seemed happy but he said he was feeling the pinch at work because of the credit crunch
8432736 there was a cctv system at the property which has been recovered by officers and will be examined over the coming days the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead
8432737 they wont be able to go into the house for a couple of days because its unsafe due to the extent of the fire the waiting is killing me
8432738 it is very very weird we have not heard anything we dont know whether they were in there or not
8432739 nobody knows until we can get access to the building
8432740 in preseason they have to play and get ready to go but you just kind of hold your breath all the time last week there were some really good players that got hurt around the nfl and you just hope it doesnt happen to you
8432741 oh i was surprised i didnt know what was going on
8432742 most of the world is bemused by western moralising on georgia
8432743 should support the underdog georgia against russia most support russia against the bullying west the gap between the western narrative and the rest of the world could not be clearer
8432744 account for the interests of advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership
8432745 lets be clear the issue here is not delich rather it is the blending of the perspectives of the neo nazis the islamists and the far left even if we accept delich made a mistake it would be one which simply could not have happened were is not for the poisonous rhetoric and vicious racism that has characterised the debate over israel palestine it would have been impossible without the coalescence over the past decade of the coalitions which have constituted both respect and the stwc what after all is the fundamental difference between linking to neo nazis and carrying a placard bearing the slogan we are all hezbollah now
8432746 the retail environment is as bad as ive seen and whole foods and others are doing things they normally havent had to do
8432747 the first step is that we need to be there on the store shelves and then its eventually about replacing those kinds of foods with the kinds we offer
8432748 we want to extend the brand as much as we possibly can and want to expand our business as much as we can too
8432749 the opening and expansion of these two new research centers continues our commitment to meet the challenges farmers face in europe and around the world by providing genetic solutions farm by farm field by field and hectare by hectare

8432815 aunque es una conferencia en la que participan cient ficos de todo el mundo se denomina europar porque es una forma de reivindicar que en europa podemos tambi n ser l deres en paralelismo frente a los americanos
8432816 clave a nivel mundial porque cada vez va a haber muchas aplicaciones que necesita mucha cantidad de datos

8432818 nos dirigimos b sicamente a encontrar aplicaciones para toda esa cantidad de potencia de c lculo que tenemos actualmente
8432819 no obstante en los procesos industriales que se dedican a producir cosas necesitan simulaciones y esas simulaciones necesitan mucho procesamiento y esa es una de las principales aplicaciones que estamos estudiando aqu en europar

8432833 this is in contrast with etis robust performance in h1 the first half when ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation was held flat we had taken this as reassurance that eti was outperforming the weak on trade beer market but the q3 third quarter data and trading update from july suggest otherwise
8432834 the next day or so could prove key for the uk market to see if this strength is set to continue this month has seen the ftse run out of steam ahead of the 5550 70 area once already and the temptation to book some profits on the back of the past weeks gains could prove too tempting for traders
8432835 it is more important that the group meet its 4bn target from disposals though recent comments from managements have raised doubt that it will
8432836 our sector view is cautious with the risk remaining to the downside net asset values will continue to be written down and earnings per share growth is coming under pressure
8432837 london office vacancy rates are increasing and retail sales volumes are down to recessionary levels in the last cyclical downturn this pushed rents down in both office and retail sectors this will continue to weigh on share price valuations
8432838 in valuing johnston press we believe that the market is overlooking trinitys more diversified revenue base
8432839 fifty per cent of trinitys revenues are derived from circulation versus 25 per cent of johnston and we favour trinitys national regional mix in preference to johnstons pure play regional exposure in the current environment
8432840 the most powerful small business marketing tool known to man or
8432841 yeah i need to do all that too but i just dont have the time
8432842 everyone eating there were egg line waiting drop outs who couldnt hack it anymore
8432843 i went here on a date the other night and although that didnt end well the food and service at juliette were perfect for apps we split the crab cakes and beet salad the c c were a perfect blend of crab and filler plus they had a nice little bite to them which was something i wanted to do to my date although he wasnt into it the beet salad was delicious as well nice and sweet with a little wedge of sharp cheese to balance it out for my meal i had the moules frites granted i had a few grainy ones and the top of the fries were so salty i almost sucked my tongue down my throat but aside from that delicious in addition to the food the service was terrific as well when our waiter took our drink order he was back so quickly i though maybe he was a mind reader and had them waiting for us at the next table cant complain about that
8432844 my personal message to him was that im dying and hes taking any hope away from me im appalled
8432845 without that were goners im afraid there is nothing else
8432846 we have seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses giving up pensions and selling their cars to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth
8432847 six months ago i was facing certain death very soon physically now im able to do everything that i was doing before
8432848 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8432849 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8432850 it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case
8432851 restaurant gordon ramsay has had a very good innings eight years at the top and still maintains very high standards
8432852 in the end though it is hardly surprising that an impassioned individual concentrating on one establishment such as marcus wareing has overtaken the flagship of an ever more celebrity driven empire where the name chef is rarely present
8432853 indeed the ramsay empires current performance and in particular the poor standard of the more recent openings raises questions as to its direction and its ability to maintain its reputation as an operator of the highest quality
8432854 it is the culmination of many years hard work from myself and my team and also comes at the perfect time as i will open my own restaurant
8432855 if he wants me never to get to the status i want
8432856 then my advice to him is put a gun to my head shoot me put me in a box and bury me because if you dont ill come back and ill come back ill never give up till i get where i want to go
8432857 ideally we would like to reach agreement with all the parties where there are overlapping claims but if it is not possible to resolve a dispute then we will be preparing a submission to the un clcs anyway as the uk

8432859 it is clearly having read a bit about it a very long term project
8432860 ascension island is going to be the only territorial claim that is relatively unproblematic
8432861 there could always be a scientific spanner in the works but its going to be a simple question of the commission assessing whether the areas claimed are legally part of the islands continental shelf
8432862 urban areas might be dealing with the problem more effectively but in the outlying regions it seems to be getting worse places like newport plymouth st davids stockport
8432863 so that means itd be okay if i were to touch your boob then
8432864 not necessarily i dont necessarily know you like that however if you were to be allowed to touch marias boob then by the transitive property theoretically you should be able to touch mine too if the ability transfers from rob maria audrey then rob audrey would make sense
8432865 be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont mind
8432866 ive learned that people will forget what you said people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel
8432867 i believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge myth is more potent than history dreams are more powerful than facts hope always triumphs over experience laughter is the cure for grief love is stronger than death
8432868 you know youre in love when you cant fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams

8433014 acuerdo para ejecutar la entrega del control y de las operaciones de
8433015 with this agreement goldman sachs will provide financing to allow us to further our business objectives
8433016 a deal of this magnitude will allow us to continue investing in the infrastructures which are vital to maintaining our growth which has been outstanding thus far
8433017 but like any organization in order to make it work youve got to get involved you go to national conventions and you have the cost of going there and time out of your practice
8433018 the amount of money weve spent has been far exceeded in the amount of business weve been able to generate
8433019 i wouldnt be doing it if i didnt think it was a wise investment on the part of my firm
8433020 we go to big companies and say why pay the big prices
8433021 clients are just as anxious to find good lawyers as lawyers are to find good clients
8433022 the only way we saw possible to do that was by joining up with an affiliation of firms
8433023 it was of concern to him because he has clients in different jurisdictions
8433024 its extremely helpful to have another plaintiff attorney say yes ive used this expert witness and yes the expert is good
8433025 when we have cases in the office that we think would be of interest to the public we can add our stories to the newsletter
8433026 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8433027 lets declare with one voice that barack obama is our candidate
8433028 dr evans is truly a pioneer in the field of pediatric oncology and in patient care
8433029 astro is honored to be able to extend an honorary membership to her in recognition of her admirable career and the contributions she has made to cancer patients and the field of oncology
8433030 is so efficient that it can travel at up to 3 to 5 times the true wind speed on land
8433031 high performance computing is entering a new era of massively parallel processors and petascale systems that will enable researchers to solve a new class of complex problems
8433032 but to fully leverage these resources researchers will need in depth knowledge about parallel programming principles as well as the parallelism models communication models and resource limitations of these processors
8433033 a huge challenge in teaching computational science is that computer science departments typically focus on topics that computer scientists need to know while in domain science and engineering departments like physics chemical engineering or aerospace engineering computational science courses focus on applications of simulation to those disciplines
8433034 many aspects of the nuts and bolts of computational science then fall between the cracks and as a result it is not easy for todays students to learn all they need to know to become tomorrows innovators in high performance scientific computing
8433035 although i still have a ways to go on learning the specifics of fully utilizing accelerator technology i feel that i have been given a firm foundation in the way the architecture works
8433036 i will be much more mindful of the types of engineering problems which can exploit the capabilities of gpgpus now especially considering their cost effectiveness compared to cpu clusters
8433037 this summer school has given me a starting point for cuda programming for the nvidia gpus that i plan to explore in depth
8433038 writing multi threaded code for my research in nanoparticle self assembly will help us look at bigger systems and longer time scales that are currently inaccessible maybe it will help us get results faster or maybe it will help us look at things we couldnt even think about looking at before
8433039 the contacts i made will help me keep in touch with a circle of researchers from different areas that are interested in gpu programming
8433040 the contacts and friendships that were gained over the past week will hopefully be used to keep on top of cutting edge gpu research and maybe even for a future collaboration
8433041 the project i started during the summer school with tom henretty ohio state university will hopefully provide the basis for porting coupled cluster methods in nwchem and other quantum chemistry codes to gpu enabled hardware
8433042 i plan to used what i learned at the summer school to consult on the application of gpu programming in the research projects of my fellow igert students though our regular seminars
8433043 with the trends of high performance computing moving toward heterogeneous systems learning the basics and practical applications of gpu programming is a necessity for a young researcher in computational fluid dynamics and in fact all computational sciences

8433052 titan prisons would be a huge waste of public money doing nothing to reduce crime or tackle sky high reoffending rates
8433053 the money could be much better spent elsewhere making improvements to the existing prison system and investing in measures to reduce the prison population
8433054 cement this countrys position as the prison capital of western europe

8433066 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse i do not know when that day will come
8433067 despite high praise from audience members critically acclaimed performances and the release of the much anticipated cast recording we have made the difficult decision to close the show in london a few weeks earlier than originally planned both the knock on effect of the current economic climate as well as disappointing ticket sales throughout the summer months have contributed to our decision to close early
8433068 we are grateful to our outstanding cast led by ruthie henshall julian ovenden and alexander hanson and to our exceptional production team and artistic collaborators who have helped us to realise marguerite at the theatre royal haymarket we are very proud of what we have achieved in january next year we begin rehearsals for a japanese production which will open at the akasaka act theatre in tokyo in february followed by performances in osaka and plans are underway for a spanish production in 2009 and a french production in 2010
8433069 tourists particularly the americans who traditionally keep the theatre alive in the summer are staying away thanks to the weak dollar and a recession that is starting to bite

8433074 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aide using battleships
8433075 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8433076 ever since we launched newwest net back in 2005 our community has been asking us for a print magazine
8433077 the new west with its tight focus on the big story of growth and development in the region is a logical complement to both newwest net and our growing conference series
8433078 the mountain west is changing dramatically with farms giving way to subdivisions ranches turning into hunting and fishing retreats and cities and towns becoming far more vibrant and cosmopolitan were all grappling with the changes
8433079 the new west will cover that story from every angle
8433080 i will say that i look at the website daily and mostly like it though conservative commentary doesnt exist there purposely or not

8433093 la presidenta deber a saber que el banco de espa a no depende del estado espa ol es una irresponsabilidad vincular al estado con las advertencias de un grupo de analistas bancarios de ninguna manera corresponde que sea ella quien conteste si quer a explicaciones debi pedirlas a trav s de la canciller a no puede plantear la discusi n como un tema de estado a estado
8433094 m s que quejarse por lo que dice el banco central de otro pa s cristina kirchner deber a dar explicaciones de por qu un pa s que seg n afirma el gobierno goza de una salud financiera ptima paga intereses del 15 por ciento por la colocaci n de su deuda o la salud financiera que describen no existe o detr s de todo esto hay un negociado enorme
8433095 cada vez que cualquier agencia de un gobierno realiza alguna acci n se reacciona en contra del estado no se entiende que en espa a el banco central es una entidad aut rquica y que el gobierno espa ol no interfiere en sus decisiones como s pasa en la argentina
8433096 una vez m s el gobierno demuestra que se pelea hasta con sus aliados
8433097 la idea presidencial de que el informe tiene poco que ver con un an lisis de la econom a argentina
8433098 ser a deseable que no s lo tuvi ramos actitudes declamativo sino adem s que se implementen acciones concretas me preocupa la posibilidad de que la discusi n quede en el terreno de los medios mientras que los espa oles siguen actuando seg n sus intereses y en contra de los nuestros
8433099 no s si el riesgo est exactamente en los niveles que plantea el informe pero evidentemente la argentina no est recibiendo inversiones extranjeras y estamos muy atrasados respectos de nuestros vecinos como chile y uruguay

8433102 un 60 por ciento de la poblaci n de costa rica depende econ micamente del comercio entre costa rica y eeuu por eso nos preocupa la posici n del senador obama de renegociar el tratado de libre comercio de am rica central o cafta porque para nosotros no es s lo comercio sino nuestro futuro
8433103 costa rica realiz muchos cambios sociales pol ticos y econ micos como por ejemplo la eliminaci n de monopolios para ser parte de cafta muchos proyectos dependen de ese acuerdo
8433104 en una situaci n y posici n nica ya que mantenemos buenas relaciones tanto con estados unidos como con cuba
8433105 somos un pa s peque o con recursos limitados como para tener una relaci n tan compleja por estados unidos
8433106 no todo se soluciona con libre comercio sino que tambi n se necesita un di logo de pueblo a pueblo
8433107 duele ver c mo la oficina de inmigraci n y aduanas ice trata a nuestros ciudadanos pero una reforma inmigratoria sin libre comercio como propone el senador obama tampoco es la respuesta
8433108 estados unidos realiza conversaciones multilaterales pero luego la implementaci n es bilateral
8433109 para nosotros es prioritario construir una nueva mayor a que va a apoyar todos los proyectos
8433110 sabemos que con patria querida o con vanguardia podemos establecer mayor as puntuales sobre cuestiones que no solamente interesan al gobierno sino tambi n al pa s de manera a garantizar la estabilidad y el desarrollo de determinadas pol ticas

8433113 de esta forma en los ltimos 30 d as la imagen positiva de cristina kirchner se estabiliza en torno al 30 por ciento mientras que su imagen negativa se ubica en alrededor del 35 por ciento

8433132 security fears have been heightened by mr obamas decision to hold his acceptance speech not in the convention centre in denver but in the open roofed football stadium a much harder venue to police the evidence suggests a well planned assassination attempt with weapons assembled a truck rented and hotel rooms booked in a town where most accommodation was full months before the convention but police sources doubt such an attempt could have been carried out metal detectors will search all those entering the stadium the nearest rooftops are 750 yards from the ground and will be monitored by police snipers helicopters will guard a no fly zone over the stadium and even a mcveigh style truck bomb would be kept away by a large cordon around the area

8433174 were focusing more on the delivery of that content on the internet you can see the writing on the wall in terms of online expansion its the way to go i think
8433175 a lot of blogger have come online and a lot of them really want in addition to just pretty pictures they want editorial comment some kind of text that they can plug in that doesnt look like an advertisement that looks like an actual discussion of the issues going on with the scene
8433176 so once we can send something specific to their blog they can either take what we already have there and adjust it to save them the time of actually writing it themselves or they can ask us to
8433177 if they have a specific theme on the blog that week and they like the pictures that we have that are related to the topic we can also write something about that
8433178 we would really like to cater to the diverse needs of the affiliates
8433179 our affiliates have a wide variety of ways to promote websites and that calls for different kinds of content we really want requests and feedback so that we can give webmasters something other than cookie cutter content
8433180 what were trying to do is get some webmasters that are interested in some of the more unique mainstream marketing techniques like social networking and viral marketing
8433181 most people that are affiliates at this point are doing a blog or theyre doing tgps and some of the standard stuff but what were doing now are the more unique mainstream type of techniques that we can apply to the adult industry and see if we can work out some kind of a program with specific affiliates to take advantage of those kinds of strategies
8433182 the webmasters take one look at the tour and tell us that they know they can sell this site
8433183 when we show our site tour to the webmasters we keep hearing terms like very appealing clean and compelling over and over again

8433276 ideally isps should only allow authenticated servers to propagate changes but that means everyone in the trust chain would have to participate the easiest mitigation is that isps monitor their address space and monitor who is peering with bgp through blacklists and whitelists

8433330 showing absolutely no indication theyre going to stop enriching uranium
8433331 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks iran is a threat not only to israel but this is a global threat
8433332 any kind of hesitation is being perceived by the iranians as weakness
8433333 you dont even give them 15 months necessarily you think its a more urgent matter
8433334 t he world cannot afford a nuclear iran and weapons of mass destruction everywhere in this region in the hands not only of states but also of terrorist organizations
8433335 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
8433336 responsible financial institutions and businesses worldwide are taking steps to avoid doing business with iranian nuclear and missile entities as well as with the front companies and cut outs the iranian regime uses to disguise its activities
8433337 these five nuclear and missile entities have been used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions
8433338 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
8433339 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
8433340 they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards
8433341 the issue with iran is not about uranium enrichment it wants to control the region
8433342 the reason for this is that they do not want people to panic
8433343 if there is a nuclear leak from one of irans nuclear reactors we need to have stockpiled iodine
8433344 kuwait must have emergency medical teams ready to deal with such situations who are equipped with supplies ready in all areas of kuwait who are ready to deal with every contingency
8433345 stockpile food and have alternative routes to import food into kuwait
8433346 kuwait would need to procure more trucks for this purpose
8433347 this would require oil tankers equipped to travel in shallow water during the tanker war this was done and proved to be very expensive
8433348 it was successful to maintain the flow of kuwaiti oil but expensive
8433349 powerful forces have historically attempted to control trade via this point
8433350 so they could control traffic through the gulf iran has had this intention since 1971
8433351 the maneuvers that have been carried out recently are held one after another to keep our armed forces prepared and strong fortunately these exercises have shown our great defensive capabilities to the world
8433352 security is a national issue the people expect our courageous armed forces to take even the slightest threats seriously
8433353 what we are talking about here are threats from outside the region
8433354 to all my arab brothers and sisters in neighboring countries i must say that our security is your security and your security is ours
8433355 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
8433356 reserves the right to take whatever action it deems necessary
8433357 would give iran international legitimacy for its programme which it currently lacks
8433358 the americans are not ready to allow us to attack iran
8433359 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress
8433360 it would not be right to talk about these things
8433361 threat to the whole world order and there are many actions to be made in the realm of intelligence and preventive measures
8433362 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
8433363 israel supports international efforts to place pressure on the regime in tehran to cease nuclear enrichment its time for the international community to send a clear message to the iranian leadership only if diplomacy is exercised seriously will diplomacy succeed
8433364 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
8433365 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
8433366 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
8433367 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilization development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behavior in scapegoating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
8433368 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there
8433369 there is a mechanism which is agreed between iraq and these countries on what these countries can do through the meeting of interior ministers of these countries through the expanded neighboring countries conferences which took place in kuwait and anther one that is going to take place in jordan in fall
8433370 we are going to continue these negotiations through diplomatic channels
8433371 we hope that any improvement in the relationship between iran and the u s will help the situation in iraq
8433372 it is noteworthy that despite these groundless allegations to date no single credible evidence has ever been presented to substantiate them
8433373 to the contrary several high ranking iraqi officials are on record stressing irans constructive role in the country and rejecting the solid allegation
8433374 the united states accuses iran because the two countries have as yet not resolved their outstanding disputes
8433375 the accusation is designed to stem irans rising regional influence which the u s itself helped to enhance by overthrowing two of the islamic republics most implacable enemies the taliban and saddam hussein regimes
8433376 in addition during these operations numerous jish al mahdi militia fighters and leaders of jish al mahdi associated highly trained special groups fled to iran where they received sanctuary
8433377 as far as the u s is concerned the accusation has the advantage of undermining irans image in the eyes of iraqi shiites by blaming iran for the nefarious activities of the discredited elements in the mahdi army
8433378 the allegations are also designed to provide credence for americas narrative that depicts iran as a deceitful untrustworthy and hypocritical power which while professing to support the central government in baghdad trains funds and arms iraqi prime minister nouri enemies
8433379 irans role in iraq is a byproduct of u s iran relations
8433380 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq
8433381 the security situation has improved not simply because of the surge but because of a host of other factors including the successful completion of ethnic cleansing in key areas and americas success in buying off former sunni insurgents
8433382 economic conditions the improving performance of the iraqi military the decision on the part of iran to lend greater support to the iraqi central government instead of shiite militias as well as blunders on the part of al qaeda and setbacks suffered by moqtada al sadr
8433383 theres ongoing cooperation between us on missile defense but theres nothing new on that
8433384 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
8433385 we will protect our land and territorial waters with all our might
8433386 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

8433400 irans role in iraq is a by product of u s iran relations
8433401 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq

8433404 justifications and pretexts for those us and israel who want to drag the region down a dangerous slope
8433405 who didnt adequately refute claims over iraqs supposed weapons of mass destruction
8433406 israel must on no account attack iran speak of attacking iran or even think about it
8433407 belligerent measures taken by a nation to prevent passage of vessels or aircraft to and from another country customary international law recognizes blockades as an act of war because of the belligerent use of force even against third party nations in enforcing the blockade blockades as acts of war have been recognized as such in the declaration of paris of 1856 and the declaration of london of 1909 that delineate the international rules of warfare

8433409 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
8433410 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though
8433411 the courts position seems consistent with a typical trespass case where defendants are liable even when they have a reasonable good faith but mistaken belief in authority to enter on the plaintiffs land
8433412 a blockade of coastal states that had joined the confederacy at the outset of the civil war the court explicitly ruled that a blockade is an act of war and is legal only if properly authorized under the constitution
8433413 the power of declaring war is the highest sovereign power and is limited to the representative of the full sovereignty of the nation it is limited in the united states to its congress exclusively and the authority of the president to be the commander in chief to take that the law be faithfully executed is to be taken in connection with the exclusive power given to congress to declare war and does not enable the president to do it or to introduce without act of congress war or any of its legal disabilities or liabilities on any citizen of the united states
8433414 vested in a congress of the united states which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives
8433415 to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and welfare of the united states
8433416 make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces
8433417 to declare war grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules concerning capture on land and water
8433418 fundamental doctrine of the constitution to declare war is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature
8433419 determine the existence of any threat to the peace or act of aggression and if necessary take military or other actions to restore international peace and stability
8433420 right of individual or collective self defense if an armed attack occurs against a member until the security council has taken measures to maintain international peace and security
8433421 we will be forced to react not with diplomatic but with military technical methods
8433422 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
8433423 we are currently working on a series of satellites that will be put into orbit within the next two years
8433424 iran is currently exploring the possibility of sending a human into outer space this is one of the countrys priorities for the next 10 years
8433425 in accordance with a program that we have developed by 2021 iran is to become the leading space power in the region
8433426 head of countrys aerospace organization reports production of several more satellites in the next two years
8433427 port marlborough at last appears to be listening to the wishes of picton people
8433428 the rest of the province might see the board as a marlborough identity but it lives in picton and plays a significant part in commercial aspects of the town
8433429 when board members live in places like tauranga its difficult for people in picton to approach them
8433430 it wasnt a fair split and changes did have to be made but i just think it is an opportunity we will never have again
8433431 we are never going to get back in to the first division to chuck it out because a few people are a bit pissed off is sad
8433432 quentin and kade poki have certainly made central a better club when they were playing just having better players around the way it lifted other players in the team i dont think there are going to be any macdonalds playing for marlborough in the future
8433433 the reason he stayed and it was his choice was that he wanted to play for tasman he was all pumped about it
8433434 the tasman under 20 team in the last two years that was some of the best rugby ive watched that team had a pretty much 50 50 split between the two provinces
8433435 some of the young talent coming through from the mbc first 15 and the tasman under 21s i reckon we would have had 10 fellows playing for the makos from marlborough
8433436 the nzru should never have made us commit 2 5million to upgrade the stadium
8433437 if we didnt have that bill things might have run a bit smoother
8433438 i thought tasman was formed for the young fellas not the administrators its alright going back to marlborough but who are you taking it back to marlborough for
8433439 are you taking it back for the senior fellows now who are past their prime or are you taking it back for the young players coming through
8433440 if you are taking it back for the young fellows coming through most of them want to play professional rugby whether or not they have the ability they want the opportunity
8433441 quentin will have to go hes got a few options at the moment hes just got to get game time and show what hes got but hes definitely going
8433442 at this point were probably just going to be spoilers here were going to make other teams sweat a little
8433443 the last thing we want to do is have people come in and think were pushovers i think this series is a good message that were going to continue to fight
8433444 the pitch to hundley it kind of came out of nowhere the way he was pitching
8433445 he was cruising pretty well and all of a sudden its a 4 3 ballgame and a completely different game after that
8433446 for a year when the international economy was challenging and we have had to face a considerable increase in costs driven by a higher oil price
8433447 risks to earnings in 2008 09 are increases in raw material costs and the impact of inflation and higher interest rates on consumer confidence and demand
8433448 he also possessed a great knowledge of the association and he could explain complicated concepts effectively often using his great sense of humor

8433459 nun ja eine beschreibung die auch auf jeden blog passen k nnte ausgew hlt wird schlie lich auch da und auch nicht nur die verlobte von boris becker ganz im gegenteil solche klatschgeschichten kommen dort ganz im gegensatz zu den etablierten medien eher selten vor
8433460 nie waren handwerklich und ethisch gut ausgebildete journalisten notwendiger als heute um das berleben des qualit tsjournalismus in der digitalen welt zu sichern

8433462 drohen die medien zum surrealen kettenbrief digitaler illusionen und t uschungen zu werden wo die fakten durch meinungen und die professionellen nachrichtensammeler von durchgeknallten kommentatoren ersetzt werden
8433463 but hes not ready to lead the united states of america
8433464 she agrees with him on the issues but she didnt say that he was prepared
8433465 john mccain has a life time of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8433466 she comes out of this week in denver and the entire election season as a bigger and more powerful figure than she ever was before
8433467 democrats must always remember this night they could have had hillary clinton and she would have won

8433470 our oil and gas addiction in particular has led to wars and human rights abuses in many countries u s dependence on oil and gas has driven an unparalleled assault on the global environment and on human rights in many nations
8433471 we oppose energy utility deregulation we recognize that deregulation and its reliance on markets as opposed to state based regulations is incapable of providing affordable reliable and clean energy we support state efforts to regain control over electricity by establishing democratic public control systems to locally coordinate supply and demand and by eliminating energy trading
8433472 new construction should be required to achieve substantial portions of its heating energy from the sun
8433473 we call for independent public access radiation monitoring at all nuclear facilities
8433474 we call for major public investment in mass transportation so that such systems are cheap or free to the public and are safe accessible and easily understandable to first time users
8433475 hahaha short of spending trillions on mass transit youre never going to get all three and since were talking about the government running this system youre never going to get anything thats easily understandable no matter how much you spend
8433476 the present day approach of upgrading streets to accommodate increased traffic generates new traffic because access is now easier and people will now take jobs further from their homes or purchase homes further from their jobs
8433477 this is the best part the greens admit that people dont like taking transit admit that private transport is faster and that public transit wouldnt work without massive subsidies
8433478 redirect resources that currently go to enhancing auto capacity into expanding human scale transit options
8433479 what the hell is a human scale transit option and id love to see the day when a public mass transit system is more economical to use than a private system thats also the day communism will finally work and pigs will fly
8433480 emphasize the use of light and heavy rail for freight transportation
8433481 why its slower it has a lot more delays and is constrained in where and how it can go an airplane or truck can bypass congestion a train cant just ask anyone whos taken amtrak speaking of which
8433482 expand our countrys network of rail lines including high speed regional passenger service
8433483 ban flights between cities where land based travel options can get a passenger to their destination within four hours

8433507 all this fighting is just distracting us from the real enemies
8433508 people with differing views put forth their beliefs in polite discourse
8433509 the modern day undercurrent of antipathy by society as a whole is spookily similar to the antipathy which was present against early christians
8433510 all this fighting is just distracting us from the real enemies
8433511 atheists are satanists the new age movement are satanist catholics are satanists if they are doing bad there not real christians im right the rest of you are wrong and to hell with the lot of you
8433512 yes and the first thing we learn on this site is to trust the established version of history lol i think its you that needs to do some research
8433513 if tortures as horrific as these were still morally acceptable to the majority they would still be carried out and most definitely be carried out against atheists but we as society have moved on since then hmmm coincidentally since churches no longer rule nations funny that
8433514 yes and the first thing we learn on this site is to trust the established version of history lol i think its you that needs to do some research

8433519 because its labor day they thought folks might be traveling home or getting ready for holiday celebrations so it might be better to open early
8433520 people will still have a large selection to choose from
8433521 what do these secreted proteins have in common in terms of their physical and chemical properties amino acid sequence and structural features that can be used to predict them
8433522 if the city and its guidelines cannot protect the historic structures on this block then they can not protect structures anywhere in irvington
8433523 any observations besides that this is a giant can of worms
8433524 looking out for oregons middle class and those working hard to get ahead
8433525 so i live on se 21st and powell now im loving the area and the options that are available to me to get downtown
8433526 the one thing i find absolutely stupid is that there is no 21st avenue bus service what is wrong with this picture
8433527 the challenge is that being based on the payroll tax trimets revenue expands as area employment expands
8433528 from a big policy point of view its kind of broken were encouraging this change in travel behavior but the revenue doesnt support the change
8433529 its somewhat easier for trimet to find capital dollars than to find operating dollars
8433530 and then after that well look at bus expansion things are kind of spoken for
8433531 adding frequency and amenities to existing routes is more effective in attracting riders than offering new infrequent routes
8433532 im certainly in support of light rail im glad theyre doing it
8433533 but i wonder if we arent shortchanging more frequent services and replacement busses
8433534 there are tons of people driving biking and walking north and south on 21st it is an ideal inner city north south avenue and there is no service at all
8433535 the 20 along burnside is packed during rush hour and its not even a frequent service bus it baffles me as to why its not ive sat on burnside watching the 20 go by every 18 or 20 minutes completely packed and they go by the stop
8433536 almost the entire day there are only one or two busses that wont have every seat filled most of the time every seat is filled and theyll have one or two people standing up right now that bus runs every 30 minutes and its a real pain if youre trying to do stuff
8433537 i would love to know what i would have to do to give trimet a little kick in the butt to put a bus on there
8433538 they can be a very low percentage of your population
8433539 its not a good measure a school can fail because of a small subgroup
8433540 thats a terrific stigma to put on a lot of these schools that have very dedicated staff
8433541 its still too early to tell exactly what its going to do
8433542 if a tree comes through the roof and buries them underneath there theyre going to be on their own
8433543 the citizens should not be worried about the flooding again
8433544 the moment i heard them together ross singing austins controlled screaming and nicoles cute vibe i instantly knew that would be the focus of the record
8433545 killed myself when i was young with my fingers on the poison gun cause i had to come back new
8433546 andy warhol said make art and while people are deciding what that art is make more art
8433547 after making records for big corporations i kind of lost my compass
8433548 then i was like do i want to do this
8433549 thats just a weird winter document that record i had no intention for it to come out well i did but i didnt make it thinking it was going to be in a record store at some point
8433550 in certain parts of the country if you touch on religious themes at all people react to it in markedly different ways
8433551 i remember seeing this thing that said i was a born again christian the notion that one could be writing from a different place or with a different voice is kind of lost you have to be really literal about it now or preface it with something my name is not this my name is this

8433600 is a fight for the future and a fight we must win together
8433601 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8433602 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8433603 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8433604 we dont need four more years of the last eight years more economic stagnation more war and less diplomacy
8433605 to my supporters to my champions to my sisterhood of the travelling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you
8433606 clean off the fingerprints from your clear cards after youve made them i always see a lot of smudges on mine thanks
8433607 showing absolutely no indication theyre going to stop enriching uranium
8433608 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks iran is a threat not only to israel but this is a global threat
8433609 any kind of hesitation is being perceived by the iranians as weakness
8433610 you dont even give them 15 months necessarily you think its a more urgent matter
8433611 t he world cannot afford a nuclear iran and weapons of mass destruction everywhere in this region in the hands not only of states but also of terrorist organizations
8433612 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
8433613 responsible financial institutions and businesses worldwide are taking steps to avoid doing business with iranian nuclear and missile entities as well as with the front companies and cut outs the iranian regime uses to disguise its activities
8433614 these five nuclear and missile entities have been used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions
8433615 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
8433616 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
8433617 they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards
8433618 the issue with iran is not about uranium enrichment it wants to control the region
8433619 the reason for this is that they do not want people to panic
8433620 if there is a nuclear leak from one of irans nuclear reactors we need to have stockpiled iodine
8433621 kuwait must have emergency medical teams ready to deal with such situations who are equipped with supplies ready in all areas of kuwait who are ready to deal with every contingency
8433622 stockpile food and have alternative routes to import food into kuwait
8433623 kuwait would need to procure more trucks for this purpose
8433624 this would require oil tankers equipped to travel in shallow water during the tanker war this was done and proved to be very expensive
8433625 it was successful to maintain the flow of kuwaiti oil but expensive
8433626 powerful forces have historically attempted to control trade via this point
8433627 so they could control traffic through the gulf iran has had this intention since 1971
8433628 the maneuvers that have been carried out recently are held one after another to keep our armed forces prepared and strong fortunately these exercises have shown our great defensive capabilities to the world
8433629 security is a national issue the people expect our courageous armed forces to take even the slightest threats seriously
8433630 what we are talking about here are threats from outside the region
8433631 to all my arab brothers and sisters in neighboring countries i must say that our security is your security and your security is ours
8433632 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
8433633 reserves the right to take whatever action it deems necessary
8433634 would give iran international legitimacy for its programme which it currently lacks
8433635 the americans are not ready to allow us to attack iran
8433636 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress
8433637 it would not be right to talk about these things
8433638 threat to the whole world order and there are many actions to be made in the realm of intelligence and preventive measures
8433639 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
8433640 israel supports international efforts to place pressure on the regime in tehran to cease nuclear enrichment its time for the international community to send a clear message to the iranian leadership only if diplomacy is exercised seriously will diplomacy succeed
8433641 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
8433642 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
8433643 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
8433644 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilization development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behavior in scapegoating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
8433645 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there
8433646 there is a mechanism which is agreed between iraq and these countries on what these countries can do through the meeting of interior ministers of these countries through the expanded neighboring countries conferences which took place in kuwait and anther one that is going to take place in jordan in fall
8433647 we are going to continue these negotiations through diplomatic channels
8433648 we hope that any improvement in the relationship between iran and the u s will help the situation in iraq
8433649 it is noteworthy that despite these groundless allegations to date no single credible evidence has ever been presented to substantiate them
8433650 to the contrary several high ranking iraqi officials are on record stressing irans constructive role in the country and rejecting the solid allegation
8433651 the united states accuses iran because the two countries have as yet not resolved their outstanding disputes
8433652 the accusation is designed to stem irans rising regional influence which the u s itself helped to enhance by overthrowing two of the islamic republics most implacable enemies the taliban and saddam hussein regimes
8433653 in addition during these operations numerous jish al mahdi militia fighters and leaders of jish al mahdi associated highly trained special groups fled to iran where they received sanctuary
8433654 as far as the u s is concerned the accusation has the advantage of undermining irans image in the eyes of iraqi shiites by blaming iran for the nefarious activities of the discredited elements in the mahdi army
8433655 the allegations are also designed to provide credence for americas narrative that depicts iran as a deceitful untrustworthy and hypocritical power which while professing to support the central government in baghdad trains funds and arms iraqi prime minister nouri enemies
8433656 irans role in iraq is a byproduct of u s iran relations
8433657 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq
8433658 the security situation has improved not simply because of the surge but because of a host of other factors including the successful completion of ethnic cleansing in key areas and americas success in buying off former sunni insurgents
8433659 economic conditions the improving performance of the iraqi military the decision on the part of iran to lend greater support to the iraqi central government instead of shiite militias as well as blunders on the part of al qaeda and setbacks suffered by moqtada al sadr
8433660 theres ongoing cooperation between us on missile defense but theres nothing new on that
8433661 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

8433681 justifications and pretexts for those us and israel who want to drag the region down a dangerous slope
8433682 who didnt adequately refute claims over iraqs supposed weapons of mass destruction
8433683 israel must on no account attack iran speak of attacking iran or even think about it
8433684 belligerent measures taken by a nation to prevent passage of vessels or aircraft to and from another country customary international law recognizes blockades as an act of war because of the belligerent use of force even against third party nations in enforcing the blockade blockades as acts of war have been recognized as such in the declaration of paris of 1856 and the declaration of london of 1909 that delineate the international rules of warfare
8433685 as part of general international law and customary international law
8433686 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
8433687 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though
8433688 the courts position seems consistent with a typical trespass case where defendants are liable even when they have a reasonable good faith but mistaken belief in authority to enter on the plaintiffs land
8433689 a blockade of coastal states that had joined the confederacy at the outset of the civil war the court explicitly ruled that a blockade is an act of war and is legal only if properly authorized under the constitution
8433690 the power of declaring war is the highest sovereign power and is limited to the representative of the full sovereignty of the nation it is limited in the united states to its congress exclusively and the authority of the president to be the commander in chief to take that the law be faithfully executed is to be taken in connection with the exclusive power given to congress to declare war and does not enable the president to do it or to introduce without act of congress war or any of its legal disabilities or liabilities on any citizen of the united states
8433691 vested in a congress of the united states which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives

8433698 we will be forced to react not with diplomatic but with military technical methods
8433699 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
8433700 we are currently working on a series of satellites that will be put into orbit within the next two years
8433701 iran is currently exploring the possibility of sending a human into outer space this is one of the countrys priorities for the next 10 years

8433711 whoever has the hereafter as his main concern allah will fill his heart with a feeling of richness and independence he will be focused and feel content and this world will come to him in spite of it whoever has this world as his main concern allah will cause him to feel constant fear of poverty he will be distracted and unfocused and he will have nothing of this world except what was already predestined for him
8433712 know that victory achievement comes through patience and that ease comes through hardship
8433713 the search of time is one of the most frequent causes of stress
8433714 they have to start filming in september and its all contingent on evos tco permit which were expected to receive on september 4 that might be cutting it close for their production schedule
8433715 embark on an amazing african adventure battling extreme conditions and interacting with wildlife such as elephants and gorillas while attempting to forge alliances with strangers from diverse backgrounds
8433716 sesungguhnya allah telah redha kepada mereka muhajirin dan ansar dan mereka juga telah redha kepada nya
8433717 dan adapun pemergian ke basrah ummul mukminin aisyah az zubair dan thalhah radhiallahu anhum berserta orang orang yang bersama dengan mereka tidaklah mereka sedikitpun ingin membatalkan kekhalifahan ali radhiallahu anhu mereka tidak juga mencabar jawatan tersebut mereka tidak menyebut apa apa kecacatan yang merendahkan beliau ali radhiallahu anhu daripada jawatan tersebut tidak juga bertujuan mengangkat khalifah yang baru yang lain dan tidak memperbaharui baiah kepada sesiapa yang lain ini adalah sesuatu yang tidak dapat diingkari oleh sesiapa dengan apa cara jua kebenaran yang sebenar yang tidak memiliki apa apa permasalahan padanya adalah mereka tidak pergi ke basrah untuk memerangi ali atau menentangnya atau mencabut baih daripadanya yang benar mereka berangkat ke basrah tidak lain adalah untuk menutup daripada berlakunya perpecahan yang baru dalam islam disebabkan peristiwa pembunuhan yang zalim ke atas amirul mukminin uthman radhiallahu anhu
8433718 orang orangpun merasa tenang lagi lega kerana persatuan tersebut pada waktu malamnya kedua dua pihak bermalam dalam keadaan yang sebaik baiknya
8433719 penduduk kufah pasukan ali menyerbu kita pada malam hari mereka mengkhianati kita
8433720 dont make it about a christian thing because its not just that some people are just more spiritually evolved than others
8433721 zainab juga telah menyaksikan pertempuran demi pertempuran yang terpaksa ditempuh oleh ayahnya dalam menentang kaum pemberontak yang dipimpin oleh muawiyah bin abu sufyan seperti pertempuran di siffin
8433722 ya allah jadikanlah beliau orang yang memimpin kepada hidayah dan berikanlah kepada beliau hidayah
8433723 pasukan pertama daripada kalangan umatku yang berperang di laut telah dipastikan bagi mereka tempat di syurga
8433724 dan tidaklah muawiyah mengingkari sedikit jua akan keutamaan ali dan hak beliau untuk menjadi khalifah akan tetapi pada ijtihad beliau perlu didahulukan penangkapan ke atas para pembakar api fitnah daripada kalangan para pembunuh usman radhiallahu anh daripada urusan baiah dan beliau juga berpendapat dirinya paling berhak untuk menuntut darah usman
8433725 tidak akan datang hari kiamat sehingga dua kumpulan yang besar saling berperang berlaku antara kedua duanya pembunuhan yang dahsyat padahal seruan kedua duanya adalah satu yakni kebaikan islam dan umatnya
8433726 lalu ali berangkat meninggalkan kufah dan menuju di permulaan jalan yang menuju ke arah syam dari iraq ali mengisyaratkan supaya orang ramai tetap tinggal di kufah dan mengirimkan yang selainnya ke syam sampai berada kepada muawiyah bahawa ali telah mempersiapkan pasukannya dan ali sendiri keluar untuk memerangi beliau maka para pembesar syam mengisyaratkan kepada muawiyah agar dia sendiri turut keluar untuk berhadapan dengan pasukan ali maka orang orang syam berangkat menuju ke sungai furat melalui siffin dan ali maju bersama pasukannya menuju siffin juga seandainya ali tidak mempersiapkan pasukan yang bergerak dari kufah nescaya muawiyah tidak akan bergerak dari syam
8433727 sesungguhnya orang yang membunuh orang islam dengan tangan kaum muslimin setelah terjadinya pembunuhan usman maka dosanya berada di atas para pembunuh usman kerana mereka adalah pembuka pintu fitnah dan mereka yang menyalakan apinya dan mereka yang menipu sebahagian hati kaum muslimin dengan sebahagian yang lain
8433728 dan muawiyah bukanlah daripada kalangan mereka yang memilih untuk memulakan perang bahkan beliau daripada kalangan yang paling menghendaki agar tidak berlaku perang yang benar adalah dengan tidak sepatutnya berlakunya peperangan meninggalkan peperangan adalah lebih baik bagi kedua dua pihak tidaklah dalam peperangan tersebut perang siffin wujud satu pihak yang benar akan tetapi ali lebih mendekati kebenaran berbanding muawiyah peperangan adalah peperangan kerana fitnah tidak ada yang wajib dan tidak ada yang sunat dan meninggalkan perang adalah lebih baik bagi kedua dua pihak hanya sahaja ali adalah lebih benar dan ini merupakan pendapat al imam ahmad dan kebanyakan ahli hadis dan kebanyakan para imam fiqh dan ini juga merupakan pendapat para tokoh sahabat dan tabiin yang selalu mendapat kebaikan
8433729 sesungguhnya saya telah datang menemuinya dan tinggal bersamanya beberapa lama maka saya dapati ia seorang yang kuat menjaga solat suka kepada kebaikan selalu bertanya tentang masalah feqah dan berpegang teguh kepada sunnah al bidayah wan nihayah jilid 8 hal 233
8433730 ya allah perluaskanlah rahmat untuk muawiyah demi allah bukanlah dia sama seperti orang orang sebelumnya dan tidaklah pula akan datang sesudahnya orang sepertinya sesungguhnya anaknya yazid adalah salah seorang yang soleh dari ahli keluarganya oleh itu hendaklah kamu berada di tempat masing masing dan serahkan ketaatan dan baiah kamu kepadanya
8433731 aku mendengar ibnu umar r a ditanya oleh seseorang penduduk iraq tentang seorang yang memakai ihram lalu dia membunuh lalat apakah dendanya lantas ibnu umar r a menjawab penduduk iraq bertanyakan tentang denda membunuh lalat sedangkan mereka telah membunuh anak lelaki kepada anak perempuan cucu rasulullah s a w
8433732 sesungguhnya tidak terbukti sama sekali bahawa yazid yang membunuh husain r a kerana itu tidak harus untuk dikatakan bahawa beliaulah yang membunuh husain r a ataupun yang memerintahkannya apatah lagi untuk melaknatnya kerana tidak harus menisbahkan seseorang muslim kepada suatu dosa besar tanpa sebarang kepastian
8433733 tidak sahih di sisi kita bahawa yazid telah memerintahkan supaya husain r a dibunuh
8433734 imam muhallab berkata hadis ini menunjukkan kedudukan yang mulia untuk muawiyah r a kerana dialah orang yang mula mula berperang merentasi lautan dan juga kedudukan mulia anaknya yazid kerana dialah orang yang mula mula memerangi bandar qaisar
8433735 wahai manusia orang orang kufah dengan nama allah aku bersumpah untuk bertanya kamu ceritakanlah tidakkah kamu sedar bahawasanya kamu mengutuskan surat kepada ayahku menjemputnya datang kemudian kamu menipunya bukankah kamu telah memberikan perjanjian taat setia kamu kepadanya kemudian kamu membunuhnya membiarkannya dihina celakalah kamu kerana amalan buruk yang telah kamu lakukan untuk dirimu
8433736 wahai penduduk kufah wahai pembelot dan pengkhianat kami adalah ahlul bait yang allah taala menguji kami dengan kamu dan menguji kamu dengan kami
8433737 kamu telah membunuh kami dan merampas harta benda kami sebagaimana kamu telah membunuh datuk kami ali r a pedang pedang kamu sentiasa menitiskan darah darah kami ahlul bait
8433738 seramai dua puluh ribu penduduk iraq telah berbaiah kepada husain kemudian mereka mengkhianatinya lalu memberontak terhadapnya dalam keadaan baiah masih lagi berada di tengkuk tengkuk mereka dan membunuhnya
8433739 bukan dari kalangan kami orang yang memukul mukul pipi mengoyak ngoyak kolar baju dan menyeru dengan seruan jahiliyyah
8433740 syiah pada zaman imam imam a s hidup dalam keadaan taqiyyah menyembunyikan pegangan mereka serta menyatakan tidak sebagaimana yang dianuti oleh itu tidak terdapatnya syiar syiar sebegini pada zaman mereka bukan menunjukkan amalan tersebut tidak di syariatkan untuk zaman ini andaikata syiah pada zaman mereka hidup di zaman ini sudah tentu mereka akan melakukan sebagaimana yang kita lakukan ini seperti menaikkan bendera bendera hitam dalam menghidupkan upacara mengingati imam husain begitu juga di rumah rumah untuk menyatakan kesedihan
8433741 bukankah imam maksum menyuruh supaya kamu menyembunyikan agama kamu kerana ianya membawa kepada kemulian sebagaimana yang diriwayatkan oleh al kulaini di dalam kitab paling sahih di sisi syiah iaitu al kafi daripada imam jaafar as sadiq a
8433742 sesungguhnya kamu berada di atas agama yang mana sesiapa yang menyembunyikannya akan dimuliakan oleh allah dan sesiapa yang menzahirkannya akan dihina oleh allah al kafi jilid 2 hal 223
8433743 we can drop them from the tree onto a big rock
8433744 pretty soon well wonder how we got along without it and it wont even be noticed
8433745 you can slow a picture down so much that you can see the grains of sand and the clay around the bag you can see whether or not a person has shaved that day
8433746 the commissioner has come around and hes embraced it because the technology is undeniable im sure there was a time when all of us watched baseball on black and white tvs now i bet you everybody in the room has a high def tv
8433747 the commissioner has been very clear were not going any farther than weve gone
8433748 but we dont expect anybody is going to impact the game in that fashion if it were true that something like that did happen wed impact them very quickly from the commissioners office without a doubt but we dont have that fear not at all everybodys going to want to show the play
8433749 our state is better prepared than it has been before to respond to a major disaster
8433750 but i want to emphasize that our citizens have a personal responsibility
8433751 its still too early to tell exactly what its going to do
8433752 if a tree comes through the roof and buries them underneath there theyre going to be on their own
8433753 the citizens should not be worried about the flooding again
8433754 you should live every day like it would be your last
8433755 to dispose of clothes which have only been worn a few times in favour of new cheap garments which themselves will also go out of fashion and be discarded within a matter of months
8433756 i get a feeling that people are trying to become more individual at the moment and buying secondhand clothes is a way to do that
8433757 there has been exposure of certain high street retailers who have not been clean as they should be in their supply base so if you want cheap clothes and a clean conscience then a charity shop is an obvious route
8433758 for shoppers who love the dig and delve experience of shops like tk maxx there is really not much difference in going to a charity shop it is all about enjoying the experience of finding a bargain
8433759 a certain section of consumers are turning their back on fast fashion and like the idea of recycling
8433760 we are not in that place where charity shops used to be where people come to us because they have no money and nowhere else to go we think we are much more attractive as somewhere where you can find unusual interesting and one off pieces of clothing sales are driven by that and we have put a lot of work into getting better quality and interesting donations
8433761 you can get clothing as cheap or cheaper at supermarkets and value shops
8433762 this end of the market should do well when householders are hard up
8433763 but there is a problem in whether we can find enough quality donations
8433764 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8433765 s as operadoras poder o atuar com qualquer m todo inclusive o guardi o
8433766 salvo quando a conduta delituosa tiver sido realizada por meio dessa modalidade de comunica o
8433767 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8433768 many people speak of ghosts but few have ever seen one
8433769 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8433770 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8433771 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8433772 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8433773 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8433774 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8433775 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8433776 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8433777 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

8433781 it was awesome britney really proves how much the fans really matter because the fans really want to see britney win and turn it around
8433782 to be honest i dont think this will be the year fall out boy
8433783 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus
8433784 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff
8433785 the weakness in the dollar and the strength in u s exports are acting like a bit of an automatic stabilizer for the u s economy
8433786 its a key offset at a time when other things are not so good
8433787 clintons speech marked an end to her campaign against obama

8433790 do i have the ability to speak with experience about someone who has abused everyone hes dealt with
8433791 there isnt a republican serving in the senate thats happy hes the nominee now theyre all supporting him but ill tell you they have told me ive had republican senators tell me they dont think theyll vote for him

8433793 securing virtual worlds against real attacks the challenges of online game development
8433794 typically when a gaming account is compromised attackers will convert the objects they steal into virtual currency and then convert the virtual currency into real money

8433797 diverticulitis is a real medical condition it can be serious it can lead to operations surgery colon perforations even death in rare instances

8433800 in preseason they have to play and get ready to go but you just kind of hold your breath all the time last week there were some really good players that got hurt around the nfl and you just hope it doesnt happen to you
8433801 oh i was surprised i didnt know what was going on
8433802 the initiative has not materialized because the capital costs of the project have exceeded the original budget by about 25 per cent
8433803 we were only building the building it was supposed to go ahead but we never got that far
8433804 currently on p e i theres just not enough bioscience industries here to fill or meet the building so the occupancy level is a good part of where the decision ended up
8433805 it will be an incubator mall what we may do is combine bioscience with the service industry and that way were not so focused on the infrastructure component of the building which is very expensive
8433806 we didnt necessarily back out in terms of the deal that was being proposed it just didnt work out at the end of the day for either party
8433807 were going to need some assistance in terms of hopefully some financing assistance
8433808 nothing is dead yet were just trying to move through all the costings we have to raise some more cash to basically allow the project to go ahead
8433809 marcus wareing is emerging from ramsays shadow as the proprietor of what is now clearly the best restaurant in london
8433810 in the end though it is hardly surprising than an impassioned individual concentrating on one establishment such as marcus wareing has overtaken the flagship of an ever more celebrity driven empire where the name chef is rarely present
8433811 it is the disappointing standards at ramsays three most recent mass market openings which are most immediately concerning each of them the warrington devonshire house and foxtrot oscar is nominated in roughly one in every three of the survey reports they attract in the most disappointing meal of the year category these newcomers are so uninspired in concept and so erratic in performance that if they were opened by independent operators they would likely be closed within a year
8433812 what he urgently needs to do is to stop chasing media attention across the globe and to start putting some real effort into improving standards at the restaurants in his london heartland
8433813 we are very proud of the huge success of p trus which was opened by grh in march 1999 and as a company we have been instrumental in continually raising its game to help it evolve into the restaurant that it is today
8433814 grh have taken the one and two top spots in the current hardens guide which is surely cause for plaudits rather than the inevitably negative spin that the guides editors have chosen in order to generate publicity for their guide
8433815 i am incredibly proud to have achieved this accolade particularly from such a respected guide as hardens
8433816 it is our feeling that the writers of restaurant guides such as hardens vary in their opinions from food guides such as michelin and it is the latter that our industry as a whole looks to as the ultimate gauge of success
8433817 if i never speak to that guy for the rest of my life it wouldnt bother me one bit
8433818 wouldnt give a fuck i admire gordon but would i lose sleep knowing he wouldnt be there no chance when you wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and all you see is a man who is constrained confined and trapped then youve got to change
8433819 put a gun to my head shoot me put me in a box and bury me because if you dont ill come back and come back ill never give up until i get where i want to go
8433820 when i was doing shows nobody ever fed me i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny

8433921 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8433941 i attempted to get up to use the restroom rather urgently during the 7th inning stretch as god bless america was beginning
8433942 as soon as the latter came out of my mouth my right arm was twisted violently behind my back and i was informed that i was being escorted out of the stadium
8433943 i was sitting in the tier level and of course this is the highest level of the stadium and i was escorted in this painful manner down the entire length of the stadium
8433944 when we reached the exit of the stadium they confiscated my ticket and the first officer shoved me through the turnstiles saying get the hell out of my country if you dont like it
8433945 nowhere on the yankee stadium ticket policy nor on any posted sign does it say that forced patriotism is a required element to attend a baseball game nowhere in the laws of this country would that begin to be defensible
8433946 furthermore when the two officers returned to their section steve who was still in the stadium overhead one of the officers say we got to watch ourselves
8433947 i do not believe in god nor am in support of this country to a degree of patriotic fanaticism the fact that i wanted to use the restroom instead of standing through god bless america should not be grounds for a forcible ejection from a baseball game
8433948 this tip doesnt surprise me at all everyone has to stand just like in school and youll get berated and harassed if you dont

8433955 it is not only that we have no gas since april 22 but on march 15 the elevator fell to the basement with my sister in law and her three kids inside
8433956 supposedly it was repaired then on aug 12 we heard a loud noise and felt the whole building shake it was the elevator that had fallen a second time also with a person inside thank god no one was seriously hurt
8433957 they management send us these letters saying things like we are sorry for the inconvenience we are working hard to solve the problem etc
8433958 but when we ask for updates they never come to the phone they refuse to speak to us and nothing gets done

8433984 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8433985 was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8433986 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements he said
8433987 mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8433988 the deadline was extended to accept minor league contracts voluntarily entered into by the clubs and the players with the help of their agents he said
8433989 it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8433990 we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system coonelly said
8433991 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8433992 friendfeed downloads millions of rss and atom feeds every hour sup makes it much more efficient and lets us check much more frequently like every minute or every couple of seconds 30 minutes to polling every 300 minutes 5 hours and also monitored the appropriate sup feed every 3 minutes the total amount of feed polling would be reduced by about 90 and new updates would typically appear 10 times as fast
8433993 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8433994 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8433995 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8433996 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8433997 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8433998 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8433999 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8434000 who are open to doing something on the production side
8434001 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8434002 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8434003 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8434004 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8434005 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8434006 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8434007 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8434008 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8434009 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8434010 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8434011 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8434012 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8434013 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8434014 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8434015 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8434016 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8434017 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8434018 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

8434037 no es lo mismo los casos que me reportan que los nuevos infectados que es lo que queremos conocer
8434038 no es lo mismo los casos que me reportan que los nuevos infectados que es lo que queremos conocer es identificar qu grupo se infecta m s en un a o

8434042 ministers must act to help the thousands of families struggling to keep a roof over their heads
8434043 about 50 per cent of an inspectors time is spent on the floor of the plant the other 50 per cent is overseeing paperwork most of it scientific in nature test results and the like
8434044 were concerned with the safety of the food supply and canadian consumers
8434045 there is no valid argument whatsoever that theres been cuts to the canadian food inspection agency
8434046 one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but we can always make it better
8434047 thats why were investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and have already hired 200 more inspectors with more to come
8434048 there has to be a shared responsibility there is no system in the world where every product is inspected all the time thats just not feasible
8434049 through this particular crisis we will evaluate everything we learned from it and make sure the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again
8434050 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8434051 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully we have and we continue to improve on our action plans
8434052 youre racing from place to place doing the paperwork and how much time does that realistically leave you to do inspection activities
8434053 even if your manager has the sense to tell you to use your discretion and judgment if you think you want to take a quick stroll through the plant youre often not going to have the time to do it anyway
8434054 theyve moved to a paper system whereby industry basically regulates itself so the big loss in terms of front line inspection happened long before the conservatives came onboard
8434055 the conservatives are simply doing another round in the same direction
8434056 we will not restart the plant until this investigation is complete and ive signed off on it personally
8434057 the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history
8434058 se contarmos que um curso de direito abre em m dia com 100 vagas como se tiv ssemos fechado 243 cursos
8434059 nesses tr s anos da minha gest o no minist rio fechamos mais vagas do que autorizamos
8434060 cortar vagas n o o principal a redu o de vagas vem como parte de uma reforma acad mica importante porque ajusta o n mero de alunos capacidade da institui o mas a reforma essencial para atender os alunos que ficam
8434061 live the moment and greet his teams victories less with relief and more with sincere appreciation
8434062 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful
8434063 its like what we havent gone to the final four what we didnt win the national title very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot
8434064 part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win he added
8434065 im not saying that it happens all the time but it happens at the end of that spain game most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career here at duke
8434066 like being in a coaches clinic and while theres little chance that boeheims noted 2 3 zone defense will show up at cameron indoor stadium this season collins said some of those coaches principles could make their way onto the blue devils chalkboard
8434067 doing those two things at the same time afforded me an amazing opportunity to grow krzyzewski said
8434068 throughout this time there have been sometimes articles you should do this you shouldnt
8434069 standard setting practices must be transparent standard setters must be accountable
8434070 while for significant areas there will be convergence you cant get to full convergence without taking steps to adopt fully
8434071 having two different standard setting bodies is not a sustainable model
8434072 we realize significant work lies ahead in preparing for a transition but believe ifrs has proven to be a reputable set of standards for preparing transparent financial information
8434073 i dont believe the transition will be onerous for them
8434074 because the convergence is going to be ongoing by the time we get to the point where we have to adopt we might be in the same place anyway
8434075 i have here in my hand a list of 205 a list of names that were made known to the secretary of state as being members of the communist party and nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the state department
8434076 the application failed to intialize properly click ok to terminate
8434077 at this point we need the funding for the staff to continue working on partnerships
8434078 this is meant to be a community effort government cant solve all the problems were hopefully the guiding force that helps build up these partnerships the more partners we have the more donors we have
8434079 if we could go in and take care of these things on a day to day basis rather than having to flock here that would be better
8434080 its morally right but if you want to be pragmatic about it if someone can come here and get access to all the services they need then its going to save the city a fortune down the road
8434081 were going into a down economy theres going to be some tough calls at city hall but im the housing commissioner
8434082 im going to fight for all the programs which are successful and this is a successful one
8434083 for this to be sustainable ill have to find some dollars from the for profit and nonprofit sectors
8434084 where the money is coming from we dont know yet
8434085 mit grossem stolz gebe ich bekannt dass barack obama der kandidat der demokraten f r die pr sidentschaft der vereinigten staaten ist
8434086 barack obama ist bereit amerika zu f hren und amerikas f hrung in der welt wiederherzustellen
8434087 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8434088 some days you eat the bear and some days the bear eats you
8434089 obama didnt say iran is tiny except in comparison to the once huge soviet union
8434090 at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons
8434091 we call a foul ball on this one by separating obamas words from their context and from his other comments on the subject mccains ad distorts obamas stated views on iran
8434092 the board of directors is firmly committed to dan mudd the board will continue to work closely with dan and his management team to guide the company and support the housing finance system through a very challenging period
8434093 this team will be responsible for meeting the dual objectives of conserving capital and controlling credit losses while fannie mae continues to provide crucial liquidity to the us housing and mortgage markets
8434094 theyre acting as though hes responsible for stealing the colonels secret recipe hes only aired widely held views and concerns about the changes being proposed they are being very hard nosed about the whole thing
8434095 there is zero confidence that we will not be entering another round of redundancies
8434096 patients will be able to receive treatment in any member state which will be reimbursed at home up to the level of the same or similar treatment in their health system
8434097 going private in this country is hugely expensive using hungarian dentists means we can offer people top quality treatment at a much lower price
8434098 c tempo x queste cose x adesso pensiamo a vivere la vita istante x istante
8434099 cher is director chris nolans first choice to play catwoman he wants her to portray her like a vamp in her twilight years the new catwoman will be the absolute opposite of michelle pfeiffer and halle berrys purring creations
8434100 in some ip boutiques youll have one or two partners who enjoy and are good at doing the administrative work and would perhaps be happy to scale back in client work
8434101 the make up of the people we had was not that way they were much more interested in staying in contact with their clients
8434102 i took the managing partner role as mostly a burden and not as something that was particularly enjoyable
8434103 my preferences were clearly toward serving my clients and that was a big driving force for me
8434104 but that doesnt mean you cant have a litigation practice unless you represent gm or merck
8434105 the ability to get referrals from general practice firms has slowed down considerably
8434106 at that point everyone was talking to other people and we began talking to pat kelly
8434107 since the spring the only people weve talked to are pat kelly and the two other guys
8434108 synnestvedt is the oldest continuously existing intellectual property law firm in the area and one of the oldest in the country
8434109 they bring exceptional experience not only in patent and trademark preparation and prosecution but also in intellectual property litigation
8434110 we are thrilled to welcome a partner of joes caliber to the firm
8434111 his experience will strengthen our existing intellectual property capabilities and will expand the ip services we are able to offer clients
8434112 discussing the possibility of several other attorneys from synnestvedt joining the firm
8434113 every thing happens for a reason and maybe you needed to hear something there
8434114 maybe you needed to go there to see it isnt what you needed so you can go on to the other meeting and know that you should be there
8434115 one of the most profound and important victories available under our system of justice
8434116 defendants were represented at the supreme court by nine attorneys from three of the nations largest law firms and had access to all the legal resources provided by their own vast governmental budgets
8434117 where the result is especially important and there is significant professional risk to counsel in pursuing the litigation
8434118 if this is not an exceptional case we are at a loss to describe what case would qualify
8434119 the request is made in the good faith belief that the issue requires revisiting
8434120 no lawyer rationally undertakes on a contingent basis work that would yield the same fee for the same work that could be earned without risk of non payment
8434121 we obviously are going to have to look at it closely thats a lot of money this is not a situation where there was a trial everything was done on motions certain kinds of work are recognized to be appropriate and certain kinds are not
8434122 were going to wait to see what im going to do
8434123 i cant say when hes going to pitch or if in fact hes not going to pitch until he plays catch trembley said
8434124 i just think he doesnt have the temperament to be president
8434125 do i have the ability to speak with experience about someone who has abused everyone hes dealt with
8434126 there isnt a republican serving in the senate thats happy hes the nominee now theyre all supporting him but ill tell you they have told me ive had republican senators tell me they dont think theyll vote for him
8434127 are all the problems necessarily the fault of apple or the iphone
8434128 your iphone is out of warranty so you cannot get hardware support just technical support
8434129 im so sorry apple really regrets this happening to users
8434130 you are telling me that my hardware problem started at exactly the same time as the upgrade to 2 0
8434131 well i know it sounds crazy but yes your hardware has gone bad and it just happened to go bad at the same time as the update
8434132 its not supported and you would void any warranty you have
8434133 the years of the major makers shipping out 75 in hardware and selling it for 600 are over
8434134 oh gee there are problems must be the network because in the lab it works fine
8434135 apples coterie is reminiscent of the french jacobin club and its morbid obsession with power death and adversarialism
8434136 we were fighting the church the couch and the courts
8434137 nothing was ever accomplished by hiding in a dark corner why not discard the hermitage for the heritage that awaits any red blooded american woman who dares to claim it
8434138 being able to help make changes in the way lesbians and gay men view themselves and how the larger society views lesbians and gay men
8434139 self acceptance and a good sense of my own self worth
8434140 buy a snack from me you know you love me
8434141 if your enemy is hungry feed him if he is thirsty give him a drink for in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head
8434142 children have fun holding onto a sheep and trying to last six seconds

8434147 excessive bail shall not be required nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted
8434148 like any plant disease you have to manage it but at the moment there is no cure part of our strategy is that we recommend growers to dig up the infected trees and get rid of them
8434149 it will probably come down to the point where people have to decide whether they want orange juice or not
8434150 we entered into a binding licensing agreement with immersion and are asking to have that agreement honored
8434151 we now have our full attention and focus devoted to working with innovative companies around the world including microsoft to accelerate and rapidly achieve global adoption of our haptic technology in gaming consumer electronics mobility and medical products
8434152 you only find out how strong the partners commitment is to the firm by putting it to the test over the years our firm has come through many difficult times relatively unscathed by working out problems as they come up an important part of our culture has been to discuss our problems in a diplomatic and statesmanlike manner our partners recognize that collectively we can earn more money and achieve our professional and personal goals than if we were with a smaller firm or practiced alone
8434153 i knew back when i was 18 that i probably wanted to be an attorney
8434154 i made it to the final tournament but i didnt make it to the closed door trials of eight to 10 people
8434155 it was a competitive environment so i think that was somewhat of a preparation
8434156 having gone through testing yourself in pressure conditions it makes you more capable of tolerating a stressful environment
8434157 i think my experience as an athlete helped me in college helped me in law school and helps me now
8434158 when i went to college it was going to college and training but still being expected to keep good grades but all that has prepared me for what i do now you dont find many lawyers who work nine to five
8434159 ive been juggling multiple things since i was 15 years old
8434160 it was always a national powerhouse team you had to try out to get on it
8434161 it was wonderful to do it when you were in the united states
8434162 theres definitely something to be said about the home team advantage especially in a sport like swimming where you can see the audience
8434163 every country that hosts the olympics has their own olympic torch relay
8434164 the cheering and the lightbulbs flashing it gave people here a chance to feel that excitement
8434165 it seemed like when i was running there were lines of people
8434166 there were some police but they werent holding people back there were no barriers
8434167 it was as close as ill get to my olympic glory
8434168 if they needed my counsel as a sports agent or with their sports agent they know that all they have to do is ask
8434169 yes i logged onto our site today and i tried to play a song but it would not play at the santa monica public library i want to know why not is this what youre doing with the money we invest
8434170 a very simple trick gives anyone full access to your cellphone private information in mail sms contacts and even safari
8434171 with all the hubbub going on about a cracking the iphones passcode easily through a bug in v2
8434172 the iphone is a computer just like a desktop computer and so it can easily be booted in such a way that one can mount the disk and delete or modify the devices configuration including the passcode configuration
8434173 ive found even the most novice cop geeks have been able to crack the iphones passcode and install my forensics toolkit on the device
8434174 many criminals who once thought the incriminating evidence on their iphone was safe have come to the rude awakening that passcodes do not equate to security
8434175 the times reports on the problems of adding wind farms to the power grid because of the grids old design it
8434176 okay for the next 3 hours this coal plant needs to produce more power
8434177 thats no problem excess electricity gets sold to the power company who stores it for you
8434178 in january 2007 the texas legislature convened helped win pickens a key new legal right it was contained in an amendment to a major piece of water legislation the amendment one of more than 100 added after the bill had been reviewed in the house allowed a water supply district to transmit alternative energy and transport water in a single corridor or right of way
8434179 pickens still needed the power of eminent domain if he was going to build his pipeline and wind power lines across private land and by happy coincidence the legislators passed a smaller bill that made that all the easier the new legislation loosened the requirements for creating a water district

8434187 baa will certainly have plenty of knowledge about queues to share with the 2012 organisers the british have almost perfected it as an olympic sport
8434188 if baa have been appointed security advisers for the 2012 olympics the athletes will be lucky to get in by 2013 it will take at least six months for baa to clear people through security

8434227 the cost of measuring manufacturing performance is a vital element to bottom line profitability yet too often secondary standards have mislead cfos and caused many wrong decisions
8434228 the most important standard is to know how each part produced contributes to the profitability of the company
8434229 i do not understand why profits are down the measurement of x indicated that we would have a good month
8434230 there are many reasons why an increase in pieces per hour may not cause an increase in profit the first is the sales price and therefore contribution may be lower for the product mix produced during the month another is that raw material may cost more

8434236 it would have been odd to hand back cash when weve just raised money from investors
8434237 im going to need a few minutes to understand why were raising tax on investment revenue when we brought down inheritance tax a year ago

8434239 the uks uncompetitive corporate tax system is driving firms overseas and until this is recognised and tackled we fear more internationally mobile firms will follow this path

8434251 perhaps my reaction is mainly a knee jerk one but i hope to zeus that i never start thinking of my marriage as an institution to be modeled after a corporation
8434252 but actually when you look at underlying profit and the cash being generated and our digital growth there is a lot to be encouraged by
8434253 we would expect the company to continue taking out cost to mitigate revenue declines to a degree and the presence of a strategic investor should provide some support to shares
8434254 but with cyclical structural pressures accelerating we continue to remain cautious
8434255 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8434256 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8434257 in particular to withdraw its forces behind the pre conflict lines

8434293 since i was 5 or 6 my grandmother listened and sang japanese music around the house whenever id visit wed sing karaoke thats how i learned to speak the language initially
8434294 i didnt ask my grandmother what the lyrics meant but id listen over and over and just sing along
8434295 enka is a form of i call it japanese blues the lyrics are very melodramatic and sad they talk about feeling the blues most of the songs have low tempos usually about women some are about lost loves

8434297 the costs of sexual harassment and phone sex with employees

8434300 was a bipartisan board funded by former nixon ambassador and reagan friend walter annenberg that worked with republicans and democrats in illinois to fund education programs
8434301 the rnc does have a number of people on the ground reviewing documents related to barack obamas relationship with unrepentant terrorist william ayers

8434309 we had just left templetons crossing and had walked up over the top of mt bellamy and were coming back down to the next camp ground when some of the hikers stopped to take photos of the natural canopy above the trail
8434310 one of them zoomed in on what appeared to be a body he had zoomed in on it and when the wind blew you could see what looked like a body and it appeared to be hanging by a cable
8434311 i couldnt make it out at first it was quite high up about 12 to 15 metres then the wind blew again and i saw it move
8434312 it appears to be sitting in an aluminium harness and hanging from a cable which leads us to believe it could be an airman
8434313 if it is a body then its a very significant find there will be a family somewhere who had a family member missing in action who might be able to put that person to rest

8434315 a truck had an accident and took out a 20 foot section of the guardrail at the trent river bridge
8434316 the truck lost a front axle and was left crossways of the eastbound lane
8434317 simultaneously a vehicle wrecked exactly on the opposite site of the highway on u s 70 west
8434318 that one wasnt as bad but youre talking about serious traffic congestion
8434319 it was probably the smoke we were sending up from the flares
8434320 they have worked for a long time on an emergency patch for the guardrail

8434326 im here tonight as a proud supporter of barack obama
8434327 i cannot wait to watch barack obama sign into law a health care plan that covers every single american
8434328 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander our promise of a country that really fulfills the hopes of our people
8434329 i will always remember the single mom who had adopted two kids with autism
8434330 i will always remember the young man in a marine corps t shirt who waited months for medical care
8434331 its so far away its surrounded by cops its just ridiculous
8434332 the legal requirement is that those expressing their freedom of speech are within reach of the delegates
8434333 its the greatest thing weve ever worked for how do i feel i feel like weve got 10 weeks of hard hard work ahead of us and weve just got to bring it home
8434334 im overjoyed but not just because obama is the first african american nominee for president if he was white id be just as happy im happy because he is the right man for america and for the world at this time when america elects obama president it will validate the sacrifices of our fathers my father worked and died for our family and he is smiling down right now this isnt over the hard work is just beginning
8434335 its beautiful democrats united what more could you ask for if i were a republican id be scared by the united democratic team

8434339 the process of renegotiating our banking covenants is going as we would have expected we are having a good constructive dialogue with all our lenders and we expect to conclude the talks comfortably before the end of the year there is no sticking point in the talks
8434340 of course wed like to see the government help the market but our view is slightly different to some other companies
8434341 even if it did intervene through measures like a stamp duty holiday or a fall in interest rates we still think the market would be in a difficult position its not something the government alone can fix
8434342 the community reaction is going to be that of surprise but from what i know of the details he is not known to have any connection with the muslim community in derby
8434343 i dont know his name we havent got that far other than the fact that he is eastern european
8434344 its down to the community to pull together as a result of what has happened and to work with each other to make sure that any extremists are weeded out of the community
8434345 im very concerned as to what they think of us
8434346 that is honestly the first time ive ever been asked that question ive been married and had the children today
8434347 there is no political intent in this film it is just funny
8434348 after reading the part that was handwritten for me i was not sure if i should be flattered or insulted im still a bit unsure
8434349 its a really funny script and we didnt see any reason to wander off course
8434350 we just thought lets do a spy movie because we hadnt done one before
8434351 i note the comments on the newcastle website the contents of which disappoint me because james milner was left with no option in his opinion but to formally ask for a transfer following the clubs total refusal to offer him a new contract
8434352 he was simply asking for an improvement that reflects his development
8434353 having played over 50 games last season and 160 games in the premier league he believed his improvement warranted a new contract it was made clear on two occasions there was not going to be a new contract therefore he felt that he was left with no option
8434354 yeah good question i dont know if anyone else has had any communication with him
8434355 i would do anything to help the cause of the european team
8434356 montys a tough one the only one whose emotions i had to deal with
8434357 at the end of the day he has a difficult choice coming up on sunday and im sure whoever he picks will be two good additions to the team
8434358 maybe ian feels like hes done enough thats all i can imagine
8434359 ive spoken to ian and i dont buy that comment
8434360 ive heard nothing from nick i have not been given any indication which direction hes going with his picks i have no clue what hes doing to do
8434361 she the grandmother went back in she could hear her
8434362 i think she must have lost her in the panic of getting everyone out and then she ran straight back to get in
8434363 we could hear the screaming and then we saw the flames and my daughter said mummy somethings wrong and we ran over there but it was too late
8434364 its terrible its a terrible time for the family and theyre all in a lot of pain
8434365 its been a really terrible year for them with tubbys mr tarrants troubles and their other little girl getting so sick
8434366 how can a family cope when life just hits them over and over again like this its ridiculous
8434367 elle voyait soname a elle et qu elle n arrivait pas a croire a sa propre beaut et avait besoin de dire que cette beaut venait d une force divine tant cetait fort
8434368 im sorry were going to have a debate about whether or not the earth is flat it doesnt make sense to have a debate about whether offshore drilling is going to bring down gas prices you know what its not the fact that its false ought to be reported or youre advancing a lie
8434369 this is a guy who lives in my neighborhood hes not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
8434370 be aware of the social and moral universe we inhabit and be a teacher capable of hope and struggle outrage and action teaching for social justice and liberation
8434371 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barrack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
8434372 explain that relationship for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
8434373 the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense to me
8434374 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
8434375 how do i center a fixed width layout using css
8434376 it is about making sure that they know barack knows them
8434377 i know what youre doing every day i know youve got a paycheck that only goes to the 23rd i know youre struggling
8434378 when i am president you will be forgotten no more
8434379 with people who have a lot of gifts its hard for people to identify with them
8434380 barack obama is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8434381 there are so many things about our candidate that are different that the challenge that we have is to give people a confidence that despite all these things that feel different ok i get what hes about personally that his family is like every other family that your kids go to school with
8434382 people need to know that the president is awake gets it isnt in some cocoon or bubble somewhere
8434383 as close to street level as possible really identify with these people
8434384 waiting to see that hes angry about that stuff too not just that he thinks its wrong intellectually that hes angry
8434385 25 of the largest u s corporations those with more than 50 million in revenue had 1 1 trillion in gross sales in 2005 and yet paid no federal income taxes
8434386 is proposing to use the government to remake economic policies in a way that hasnt been seen in washington in decades
8434387 with the goal of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8434388 you probably wouldnt even do that for the people you call your best friends
8434389 spraying is our last resort but with the number of positive mosquito samplings so high we need to knock that down
8434390 it the spray breaks down very quickly in about a half an hour creating minimal risk of human or animal contact with the pesticide
8434391 the virus could go in a cycle but it is too early to tell
8434392 we just know there is a marked increase this year comparable to 2003
8434393 am very interested to also learn how to stop my chihuahuas from running up down the stairs i have tried to walk up the stairs first blocking them on every third step or so sometimes it works other times the three little brats run past me and believe it or not these brats do not respond to treats

8434396 but wilson is no mere shock jock and while her revelations about pop culture occasionally restate the obvious they do so in terms so hilariously biting as to render them almost canonical
8434397 on my first record i didnt have a direction i just wanted to make a record
8434398 i feel pass it along is the best body of work ive done this is where i am now and where ive come from

8434406 i was always very busy going through school and doing other classes
8434407 i always loved doing graphic design and writing for a newspaper or magazine so i figured this would be a great opportunity
8434408 when we first come up with ideas adults arent always receptive
8434409 but once they see that we take it seriously they start to take us seriously
8434410 it was definitely intimidating going in and having them all sitting around
8434411 but they were all very supportive so i didnt feel as nervous as time went on during the meeting
8434412 c alifornia is another country you wake up in the morning and new york is already on its first coffee and the first scandal has broken in washington one more republican crony caught with his hand in the honey pot it all feels very far away

8434431 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8434432 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8434433 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8434434 dont make it about a christian thing because its not just that some people are just more spiritually evolved than others
8434435 cualquier puede decir cualquier cosa y nadie se hace responsable de lo que dice la situaci n en r o grande es conflictiva y como ministro he acudido a cada convocatoria a audiencia a pedido de los trabajadores
8434436 todos conocemos como es esto el estado no tiene facultad para impedir despidos salvo que sea una situaci n protegida por la ley no entiendo que pretenden que se haga
8434437 cuando se hicieron los 120 despidos de australtex pretend dictar la conciliaci n obligatoria y el gremio nos pidi que no lo hici ramos porque la empresa ten a que incorporar al personal y ellos deb an levantar la medida de acci n directa cosa que no quer an

8434441 dara had surgery in november 2007 to remove bone spurs and repair a partial tear in her rotator cuff
8434442 she was doing quite well but over time she developed this degenerative arthritis problem in the ac joint
8434443 we basically remove the area of arthritis and create a space so she is no longer pinched off by the spurs
8434444 theres immediate relief after the surgery and recovery is quite quick
8434445 the goal would be by six weeks to be back to full activity
8434446 this is a great way of relieving her discomfort and allowing her to resume the activity shed like to in a pain free way
8434447 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8434448 a lot of the women who dropped off the list this year were for job related reasons
8434449 in some cases its simply a matter of the woman still has a powerful position but other women are relatively more powerful and pushed her down and off the list
8434450 certainly had she been the democratic nominee that probably would have catapulted her higher
8434451 shes still an incredibly powerful force shes way more powerful than any other female senator

8434455 in some of the more heavily populated urban areas of the country family life is quite frankly in meltdown or completely unrecognisable in some areas of the country even including the more urban parts of the sleepy west in which i operate family life in the old sense no longer exists so i suggest that the general collapse of ordinary family life because of the breakdown of families in this country is on a scale depth and
8434456 i am not saying every broken family produces dysfunctional children but i am saying that almost every dysfunctional child is the product of a broken family
8434457 and what is government doing to recognise and face up to the emerging situation what is it doing to halt the decline or even reverse it the answer is very little and nothing like enough it is fiddling whilst rome burns
8434458 america was methodist once upon a time methodist or baptist or presbyterian or congregationalist or episcopalian
8434459 would have trouble recalling the dogmas that once defined all the jarring sects but their names remain at least half alive
8434460 the death of protestant america a political theory of the protestant mainline
8434461 without the political theory that depended on the existence of the protestant mainline what does it mean to support the nation what does it mean to criticize it the american experiment has always needed what alexis de tocqueville called the undivided current and now that current has finally run dry
8434462 now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve the lord and if it seem evil unto you this day whom you will serve whether the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord
8434463 that church or pastor is weird strict legalistic or a cult
8434464 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth
8434465 honor thy father and mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee
8434466 the time will come when they will not endure sound
8434467 for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgement that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him
8434468 now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord
8434469 and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord
8434470 the culture change from a stable two parent home to the fathers abandonment of his responsibilities of marriage and parenting is americas most urgent social problem the fathers absence is the main reason for unhappy homes many current social problems and is a national crisis of our time
8434471 to admit authorities however heavily furred and gowned into our libraries and let them tell us how to read what to read what value to place upon what we read is to destroy the spirit of freedom which is the breath of those sanctuaries everywhere else we may be bound by laws and conventions there we have none

8434502 i intend to tell the womens caucus that their pro abortion agenda is not only a crime against children but treachery against women of the highest order
8434503 there are millions of women hurting from the unspoken shame and guilt of abortion and they need our help they need to own what they did embrace their lost children and find healing mercy and forgiveness
8434504 in korea there are only 3 main meals and no tea time in between

8434528 o fato destacado desta confer ncia que os governos acordaram compilar as diferentes propostas de solu es de forma estruturada para ser examinadas na pr xima reuni o do grupo de trabalho entre 1 e 12 de dezembro em pozn n pol nia

8434545 hay una raz n para sufrir y es la de evitarnos el conocer demasiado de los dem s y no lo suficiente de nosotros mismos
8434546 si t dudas no lo ver s y si t lo ves no dudar s
8434547 hay dos clases de dudas la destructiva y la constructiva la duda destructiva generalmente es escepticismo las personas que tienen este h bito mental nunca hacen algo para encontrar la verdad por el contrario la duda constructiva inquiere inteligentemente no es bueno poseer una descreencia arbitraria sin investigar porque esta clase de duda es la est tica en la radio de la mente que impide escuchar el programa elaborado
8434548 la muerte nos ense a a estar en el amor divino solamente y no apegados a la carro a de la carne en la cual el amor divino reside temporalmente s nosotros amamos a las almas no debemos de tratar de retenerlas a nuestro lado para nuestra propia satisfacci n y comodidad principalmente cuando nos son quitadas para su adelanto en el sendero hacia la libertad o cuando son llamadas a descansar en el regazo del padre en la tristeza por la separaci n de sus seres queridos los tontos lloran por corto tiempo y luego olvidan pero los sabios encuentran el impulso para buscar su amor perdido en el coraz n de lo eterno lo que perdimos en la vida temporal debemos buscarlo en la c mara del infinito

8434555 we dont care how much money they have what we care about is can we make this problem go away for them we cant make him behave we cant undue the choices she made but we can make their lives better
8434556 a lot more of it is now being based on financial instability were seeing a lot more homes in foreclosure more stress more tension on the family that is erupting into violence
8434557 its hard to believe how quickly and strong the resistance has become and spread

8434568 we called police to tackle the situation and they are guarding the hospital in jessore as well
8434569 our issue is with backyard breeders and puppy mills that recklessly employ irresponsible and often terribly cruel and inhumane practices to breed innocent animals and then market them in pet stores or on the internet they are motivated by greed and profit not the love and value of the breed and each individual animal we are educating the public that any kind of wonderful healthy and loving dog can be found in a local shelter
8434570 i do my thing and she miranda does her thing

8434574 at nikon we want to continue to lead the industry in pioneering photography solutions and give our customers access to innovative technology

8434580 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8434581 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8434582 i cant walk out to the bird feeder without having my legs completely covered with them
8434583 i was talking to my sister districts and theyre all scrambling too trying to catch up with these things hopefully by the weekend it will be better i wont say theyll be gone but hopefully theyll be better
8434584 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8434585 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8434586 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8434587 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8434588 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8434589 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8434590 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8434591 that we are not a country which preaches compassion and justice to others while we allow bodies to float down the streets of a major american city that is not who we are
8434592 el hecho destacado de esta conferencia es que los gobiernos han acordado compilar las distintas propuestas de soluciones de forma estructurada para ser examinadas en la pr xima reuni n del grupo de trabajo los pr ximos 1 al 12 de diciembre en pozn n polonia
8434593 estamos en el buen camino el proceso se ha acelerado y los gobiernos se han comprometido en la negociaci n con vistas a un resultado positivo
8434594 se vaticina un lento fortalecimiento y la tormenta podr a convertirse en un hurac n ma ana o el viernes
8434595 sin embargo cualquier desviaci n hacia la izquierda de la trayectoria pronosticada podr a llevar el ojo de gustav muy cerca de jamaica
8434596 cuando vi la tierra desde arriba por primera vez era preciosa impresionante estaba en paz pero lo que realmente cambi mi manera de pensar fue ver el horizonte porque me hizo darme cuenta de que nuestro planeta es mucho m s fr gil de lo que yo cre a as que me he vuelto m s ecologista desde entonces
8434597 el regreso a la tierra fue realmente suave y sin complicaciones como en un avi n no tuve que utilizar la bolsa para el mareo que llevaba en la mano

8434602 they pay bugger all river rates i think that its very good that theres an understanding there im optimistic we can work with them to find a solution
8434603 ad hoc because everyone taking care of their own part is not going to work
8434604 and if council assets and services manager mark wheeler is expecting owners to fund the lions share then he better equip people in renwick with rubber boats
8434605 they said we have a little boy who wants to play the cornet so i packed up a spare cornet and took it out to tuamarina
8434606 with market conditions likely to remain volatile for the rest of this year delivering growth in the short term will continue to be challenging but we remain confident in the medium to long term outlook for the wealth management industry
8434607 we expect margins to contract by two to three per cent per annum over the longer term because of the competitive market in which we operate
8434608 the simple fact is were not doing right by our veterans
8434609 not here in montana and not anywhere in the united states
8434610 im actually republican originally and i think barack is a much better candidate than our alternative
8434611 everybody says that he hasnt had that much experience but i just think he knows what hes talking about
8434612 were sure hoping hes going to end up in the office do all that we can to see that he does
8434613 i have to take entire days off work drive 800 miles roundtrip to get a mammogram and come back so its good to hear that hes so concerned about things like that
8434614 hes done his research and he knows a lot about veterans and what the veterans need
8434615 the computer models are all over the place right now
8434616 its too early to theorize on galveston the potential is there but its too early to narrow down where it might go
8434617 the work was not an attempt to provoke controversy for controversys sake but an invitation to reflect made in a distinctive manner
8434618 we were conscious that with the attack on the world trade center invaders was revisiting an event that had occurred not too distantly in the past and that therefore represented a controversial subject
8434619 the work was not an attempt to provoke controversy for controversys sake but an invitation to reflect made in a distinctive manner
8434620 the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work
8434621 for stanley invaders is ultimately about an appeal for peaceful coexistence which extends beyond the subject of 9 11 we saw no reason not to show his work especially as it has repeatedly been exhibited in a number of different versions since 2001
8434622 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8434623 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8434624 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8434625 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8434626 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

8434629 by making id into something that was clearly fiction i wanted to show that the idea itself was fictional
8434630 ok lets assume that christianity is real what would that mean logically
8434631 well hey look at the world from the perspective of science see how thats better
8434632 when you really think about what christianity implies this is what you get
8434633 lets invent a universe where id is truth oh that would be the universe that science will build for us
8434634 the author of a book on cannibalism in maori history is disappointed a racism complaint has been made about it to the human rights commission
8434635 describes the whole of maori society as violent and dangerous this is a clearly racist view claiming a whole ethnic group has these traits
8434636 i think its just very sad that its come to this stage that when you write about certain topics in new zealand history you get complaints and accusations of racism levelled at you
8434637 quite right too dr moon but welcome to the culture of unfree speech and argument by intimidation that your fellow academics have studiously fostered over decades now that youve been bitten by it i hope youll join the resistance to it
8434638 new zealand has no official religion but unofficially the theology of political correctness with its long list of taboos is assuming the status and power of a theocracy academia is the heart of it and
8434639 hay emisoras ilegales a potencias no reglamentadas que interfieren en las comunicaciones o emisoras aprobadas que no controlan su potencia de salida

8434641 data who needs data at the pete kent school we dont worry about their data we invent our own
8434642 im not quite sure why organizations want to release state polling in the middle of the convention when theyre all liable to be obsolete within a few weeks anyway
8434643 demographically nevadas population is ageing slightly and becoming more hispanic neither of which bode well for obama
8434644 while florida voters like crist it is probably safe to say that they prefer the first term governor stay in tallahassee and do the job he was elected to do less than two years ago
8434645 selecting joe lieberman could surprisingly have a negative effect in florida in 2000 liebermans presence on the democratic ticket almost delivered the state to al gore because of strong jewish voter support in south florida eight years later however many democrats are not happy with liebermans abandoning of the senates democratic caucus and 25 of republican voters do not want him on the gop ticket with apparently limited cross over appeal and the risk of losses among the fragile gop base a lieberman selection would be dangerous
8434646 yeah we prefer polls that have all ticket candidates unless it favors mccain
8434647 nv should be mccain and if it goes obama then he will have his landslide unless mccain v obama really is a map changer
8434648 if you vote for everything will get fixed this is the guy to fix it
8434649 good youve been asleep for almost two weeks now i wasnt sure if you were going to wake up
8434650 yes your injuries have healed quite nicely do you think you can hold down some food

8434661 s o b i do not know that term what does it mean
8434662 that my friend is the result of just missing the explosion and from the acid that was passed to you when the torrydz touched your leg
8434663 hell no you think im gonna let you touch me after what you just said
8434664 i do not have the acid in my claws i will not harm you sighs i thought i made that quite clear to you young warrior
8434665 i only wish to put you back to bed again
8434666 i see you need to rest now sleep young warrior

8434669 port marlborough at last appears to be listening to the wishes of picton people
8434670 the rest of the province might see the board as a marlborough identity but it lives in picton and plays a significant part in commercial aspects of the town
8434671 when board members live in places like tauranga its difficult for people in picton to approach them

8434687 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8434688 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8434689 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8434690 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8434691 i did my part for that loser but i told you so

8434699 we have by hell at least gaind liberty thats worth our fall thus low tho we are driven better to rule in hell than serve in heaven
8434700 the culver city police department has taken no enforcement action at this location we were simply asked to assist the drug enforcement administration with the service of their search warrant
8434701 you are attempting to deny what is by confusing us with medical studies and statistics
8434702 scientific evidence overwhelmingly indicates that cannabis is substantially less harmful than alcohol and should be treated not as a criminal issue but as a social and public health issue
8434703 an indiscriminate and equal assault on everything from drugs like heroin and methamphetamines which have powerful public health impacts to marijuana lsd and hashish drugs whose minimal public health impacts were far exceeded by those of alcohol and tobacco my bolding rk supporting the gateway theory of drug addicition which saw marijuana as the gate through which all addicts first passed
8434704 hopefully the feds will back off in instances where people are really following these guidelines
8434705 clearly there have been abuses places that served as big fronts for illegal drug dealing
8434706 as far as im concerned i give this two thumbs up
8434707 if youre in it for profit you shouldnt be in medical cannabis
8434708 hopefully this will send a message to the federal government that california doesnt intend to deter from the course it has set
8434709 we have been operating in the dark for many years
8434710 has been like trying to hit a moving target this allows us to know what the target is
8434711 we know that cartels are controlling many of the medical marijuana dispensaries operating for profit
8434712 im hopeful the state will partner with local police and the feds to shut down the cartels
8434713 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8434714 it is with great pride that i announce that barack obama is the democratic nominee for the united states of america
8434715 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination
8434716 i am proud to be one of 18 million who stand with hillary clinton
8434717 i see our broken health care system through experience an experience shared by too many people
8434718 were all going to cheer and scream for barack obama but as a salute to senator clintons campaign and the reason we are here is because of her we felt it was right if we vote for her and do anything we can to honor her contribution
8434719 if someone had told me 45 years ago of what were about to witness i would say youre crazy youre out of your mind
8434720 it is a major major step in making real the hopes and dreams and aspirations of so many americans who attended the march and who supported the march
8434721 this nation is still a place of cheap political leaders who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political economic and social exploitation
8434722 what political leader here can stand up and say my party is the party of principles
8434723 the democratic party has come such a distance from 1963
8434724 under the leadership of people like jimmy carter bill clinton and all that lyndon johnson said sen obama is the personification of what the democratic party is about
8434725 a dirty and nasty word we cannot be patient we do not want to be free gradually
8434726 i just dont know whats going to be my reaction
8434727 i really dont i can see the 10 of us who stood after the march after the speeches and the music was over we went to the white house met with president kennedy he stood in the doorway of the oval office and met each of us and he was so proud and pleased that things went so well
8434728 talvez mais importante do que um depoimento como este em que a testemunha tem o direito constitucional de ficar calada e n o se incriminar substitu lo pela investiga o para termos acesso a informa es fundamentais
8434729 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8434730 how did we overcome such obsticals and set backs they told me i was average but i just couldnt accept that let that be the words carved in my headstone p s you hatin motherf kers were dead wrong
8434731 two races equally free cannot live in the same government
8434732 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft

8434734 someone comes in for a neurological problem and gets a brain scan the scan can have findings typical of alzheimers disease and it wont get reported
8434735 we have installed it in our radiology suites and our radiologists are starting to use it once you understand the method you dont really need the program however the quantitative aspects of the program are useful in a research setting so that measurements are done in exactly the same way
8434736 we need to look at the individual structures within the medial temporal lobe
8434737 for example in alzheimers the entorhinal cortex is often affected earlier than the other structures
8434738 people who are recruited to participate in alzheimers research studies and clinical trials sometimes do not have alzheimers at all but instead may have lewy body dementia or other conditions we may not be testing the effect of a study drug on a particular disease if the clinical diagnosis is inaccurate if we had a radiologic criterion based on something like this method wed have much greater accuracy in the clinical diagnosis and in many cases wed be able to diagnose alzheimers disease much earlier than we do now
8434739 what will drive this is when we have a medication that affects the course of the disease much more dramatically than were able to do now
8434740 oh my god mom look at how many leaves there are
8434741 you should leave it like that how the blue and the pink and the lavender of a sunset weaves together its perfect dont add the beach and the log

8434743 good show you rock and may take that in point form if you wish
8434744 the idea had kind of been floating around because people had noticed these bats with no injuries
8434745 when people were first starting to talk about the issue it was bats running into the turbine blades we always said no bats dont run into things bats can detect and avoid all kinds of structures
8434746 how much should a businesslike npc vampire charge for turning my human pc in a vampire in game x
8434747 i dont allow vampire pcs in game x they are too munchkinny goth baits unthematic and you shouldnt either
8434748 what it looks like to us is more like this
8434749 gnomes on the other hand are smurf like things with beards that sit with fishing rods in the gardens of people who dont know the meaning of taste
8434750 think of pcs as cats they like shiny things and things that move and they are funny to watch but you can never be completely sure of what theyll do next and sometimes they spaz for no apparent reason

8434760 steven has a groin problem and he will have an operation
8434761 he has been playing some games in pain he has not been fit and we decided this week the best moment for the operation is after this game
8434762 he had problems in the first leg of the game against liege and he had a problem when he was away with england for their friendly against the czech republic
8434763 we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steve would play in this match with the pain but now will have to have the situation resolved
8434764 auralex is dedicated to the educational advancement of its potential customers and the industry as a whole
8434765 participating in cedias learning labs by providing our acoustical products is a great way to educate the market about the importance of acoustics and sound control in the midst of all the high end gear associated with home theaters
8434766 there are different accounting regimes with different standards and different requirements that doesnt make them worse than ours weve had plenty of issues with our accounting regime
8434767 more incentive for foreign companies to operate in the u s
8434768 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8434769 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8434770 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8434771 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8434772 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8434773 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
8434774 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
8434775 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8434776 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8434777 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8434778 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8434779 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
8434780 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
8434781 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8434782 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8434783 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8434784 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8434785 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8434786 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8434787 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8434788 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8434789 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8434790 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages
8434791 eyesight of thousands to be saved after nice approves drug
8434792 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
8434793 clintons deputy national policy director jake sullivan outlined several irish policies that would be undertaken in a clinton white house come 2009 he said clinton would immediately appoint an american special envoy on ireland who would maintain an office in the white house and report directly to the president clinton would also firmly focus on economic development in northern ireland sullivan said and have her secretary of commerce and other government agencies get involved in developing strategies for ireland
8434794 in the observer alan ruddock begins his account with the morning of september 11 the day of the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in new york as the us special envoy to ireland richard haas was preparing for a meeting with sinn fein leader gerry adams
8434795 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
8434796 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned
8434797 anyone who omits one step in that sequence of values is falsifying the situation
8434798 605 000 long term immigrants arriving in the year to mid 2007 the eu projections show that the wave of migration to britain boosting both the workforce and fertility rates is out of step with many other european countries where deaths are expected to overtake births after 2015
8434799 trends differ for the four countries of the uk the population of england is projected to increase by 8 per cent by 2016 that of northern ireland by 7 per cent big year that and wales by 5 per cent the projected increase for scotland where fertility and life expectancy levels are assumed to remain lower than in the rest of the uk is 3 per cent across the united kingdom northern ireland recorded the highest rate of growth with a one per cent population rise last year to 1 8 million people the population of england rose by 0 6 per cent to 51 1 million scotland and wales rose by 0 5 per cent
8434800 the uk population reached 60 5 million this year and the new official figures suggest it will rise to 65 million by 2016 and 71 million by 2031
8434801 the cardinal has not made clear why religion should get a free pass
8434802 at least one blast bomb as well as bottles stones and petrol bombs have been thrown at police investigating a security alert in the tullygally and drumbeg areas of craigavon
8434803 i would appeal to everyone involved in the trouble to stop it now before someone is either injured or killed
8434804 this is not a game this is not fun what weve seen tonight is actually attempted murder please stop it now before someone is killed
8434805 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
8434806 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence
8434807 every four or eight years ireland is forced to rally round young men from this class
8434808 every four or eight years ireland is forced to rally round young men from this class and adopt them as our great national hopes
8434809 this charge of fiddling while rome burns was a problem which heaney discusses in his essay the interesting case of nero chekhovs cognac and a knocker where he recalls how he and david hammond felt unable to record a tape of songs against the immediate backdrop of explosions in belfast
8434810 we aimed to challenge sectarian divisions in the north of ireland to put
8434811 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border
8434812 the singers house by seamus heaney to david hammond people here used to believe that drowned souls lived in seals at spring tides they might change shape they loved music and swam in for a singer who might stand at the end of summer in the mouth of a whitewashed turf shed his shoulder to the jamb his song a rowboat far out in evening when i came here first you were always singing a hint of the clip of the pick in your winnowing climb and attack raise it again man we still believe what we hear
8434813 its very clear we need to deliver any agreements that weve had with the dup and the two governments the devolution of policing and justice has to happen we in our party have worked for years and are very committed to the process under way but we need to start seeing results
8434814 the oireachtas could ratify lisbon subject to a number of opt outs if necessary for example the charter of fundamental rights the solidarity clause transfer of certain matters to qualified majority voting and the inclusion of new competences such as energy security climate change and tourism
8434815 mep mary lou mcdonald has said if the irish government secures a better deal for ireland at european level only then is there an argument for a new referendum those of us on the no side want specific new additional points in the treaty and we want specific cast iron legal views on taxation she said
8434816 a succession of anti family anti life and other anti christian decisions by brussels has made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive support for europe in the lisbon referendum
8434817 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
8434818 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
8434819 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
8434820 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
8434821 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
8434822 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
8434823 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
8434824 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
8434825 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
8434826 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt

8434850 i am truly honored to receive this award the consumer federation has been in the forefront of the effort to protect consumers in this state through the information they provide and their tireless advocacy

8434872 television broadcasting has experienced lots of change in the past few years but advances in tv antenna technology have been stagnant for decades
8434873 many antennas were designed for a different era and weve been able to create antennas specifically tuned for the core dtv frequencies this is a product that people are embracing as over the air digital television will often offer the best picture quality
8434874 demand for our clearstream antennas is high because of their reliability small size and appealing design

8434884 there cant be a matchmaker either it will happen or it wont
8434885 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
8434886 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
8434887 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8434888 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8434889 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8434890 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8434891 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
8434892 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
8434893 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8434894 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8434895 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8434896 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8434897 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8434898 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8434899 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8434900 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8434901 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8434902 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages
8434903 eyesight of thousands to be saved after nice approves drug
8434904 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
8434905 clintons deputy national policy director jake sullivan outlined several irish policies that would be undertaken in a clinton white house come 2009 he said clinton would immediately appoint an american special envoy on ireland who would maintain an office in the white house and report directly to the president clinton would also firmly focus on economic development in northern ireland sullivan said and have her secretary of commerce and other government agencies get involved in developing strategies for ireland
8434906 in the observer alan ruddock begins his account with the morning of september 11 the day of the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in new york as the us special envoy to ireland richard haas was preparing for a meeting with sinn fein leader gerry adams
8434907 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
8434908 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned
8434909 anyone who omits one step in that sequence of values is falsifying the situation
8434910 605 000 long term immigrants arriving in the year to mid 2007 the eu projections show that the wave of migration to britain boosting both the workforce and fertility rates is out of step with many other european countries where deaths are expected to overtake births after 2015
8434911 trends differ for the four countries of the uk the population of england is projected to increase by 8 per cent by 2016 that of northern ireland by 7 per cent big year that and wales by 5 per cent the projected increase for scotland where fertility and life expectancy levels are assumed to remain lower than in the rest of the uk is 3 per cent across the united kingdom northern ireland recorded the highest rate of growth with a one per cent population rise last year to 1 8 million people the population of england rose by 0 6 per cent to 51 1 million scotland and wales rose by 0 5 per cent
8434912 the uk population reached 60 5 million this year and the new official figures suggest it will rise to 65 million by 2016 and 71 million by 2031
8434913 the cardinal has not made clear why religion should get a free pass
8434914 at least one blast bomb as well as bottles stones and petrol bombs have been thrown at police investigating a security alert in the tullygally and drumbeg areas of craigavon
8434915 i would appeal to everyone involved in the trouble to stop it now before someone is either injured or killed
8434916 this is not a game this is not fun what weve seen tonight is actually attempted murder please stop it now before someone is killed
8434917 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
8434918 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence

8434921 this charge of fiddling while rome burns was a problem which heaney discusses in his essay the interesting case of nero chekhovs cognac and a knocker where he recalls how he and david hammond felt unable to record a tape of songs against the immediate backdrop of explosions in belfast
8434922 we aimed to challenge sectarian divisions in the north of ireland to put
8434923 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border
8434924 the singers house by seamus heaney to david hammond people here used to believe that drowned souls lived in seals at spring tides they might change shape they loved music and swam in for a singer who might stand at the end of summer in the mouth of a whitewashed turf shed his shoulder to the jamb his song a rowboat far out in evening when i came here first you were always singing a hint of the clip of the pick in your winnowing climb and attack raise it again man we still believe what we hear
8434925 its very clear we need to deliver any agreements that weve had with the dup and the two governments the devolution of policing and justice has to happen we in our party have worked for years and are very committed to the process under way but we need to start seeing results
8434926 the oireachtas could ratify lisbon subject to a number of opt outs if necessary for example the charter of fundamental rights the solidarity clause transfer of certain matters to qualified majority voting and the inclusion of new competences such as energy security climate change and tourism
8434927 mep mary lou mcdonald has said if the irish government secures a better deal for ireland at european level only then is there an argument for a new referendum those of us on the no side want specific new additional points in the treaty and we want specific cast iron legal views on taxation she said
8434928 a succession of anti family anti life and other anti christian decisions by brussels has made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive support for europe in the lisbon referendum
8434929 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
8434930 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
8434931 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
8434932 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
8434933 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
8434934 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
8434935 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
8434936 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
8434937 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
8434938 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt

8434945 we know there are significant incidents happening in our schools on a regular basis that are frightening for parents families and students themselves
8434946 parents shouldnt be too shocked by these numbers because theyre just a better reflection of the truth
8434947 theyre moving to address this theyre moving in the right direction
8434948 we have said if a crime is committed if violence occurs we want that directly reported to the philadelphia police department to school police
8434949 some of those schools are still doing a good job for some kids

8434982 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8434983 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora
8434984 da anni le organizzazioni agricole chiedono di affrontare questo problema continua ciocchetti unidea dare la possibilit ai proprietari di poter farne un utilizzo produttivo cedendo al comune una parte di queste strutture per utilizzi sociali
8434985 nel programma presentato durante la campagna elettorale per sindaco tutto questo era stato menzionato e affrontato

8435075 ya harus tegas siapa yang mau maju apakah pak amien apa soetrisno
8435076 kalau sb mungkin masih bisa nomor dua wapres tapi kalau pak amien kan tidak mungkin mungkin di posisi wapres bisa sultan hamengku buwono x atau hidayat nurwahid
8435077 jauh sekali sb itu belum sekelas dengan pak amien saya pikir dukungan sb relatif lebih kecil meski dia memasang iklan di mana mana tetapi dia baru saja populer basis warga muhammadiyah di pan juga terus bekurang saat pan dipimpin sb
8435078 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8435080 i dont know about you but i wish they would have used red brick on the exterior
8435081 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8435082 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8435083 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8435084 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8435085 c mo vamos a poner a ernestina que acaba de fracasar a la tarde y ara a a la ma ana
8435086 i applied this strategy using these steps and i made xxx amount of bucks
8435087 this capability is a crucial first step in defining translational therapies to ameliorate the effects of inner ear disease in humans
8435088 although still a long way from the clinic the work shows that gene therapy is a potential treatment to combat some forms of congenital deafness
8435089 with one in 2 000 children born deaf because of genetic defects such a therapy would clearly be of value
8435090 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner the government are talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8435091 the estimate of green taxes is wrong as it includes taxes used to fund core public services rather than simply offsetting the cost of co2
8435092 for example while fuel duty recognises the environmental costs of driving it also pays for important public services including new roads and public transport and efforts to tackle child poverty
8435093 but hes not ready to lead the united states of america
8435094 she agrees with him on the issues but she didnt say that he was prepared
8435095 john mccain has a life time of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8435096 im called a goblin shark i cant really see myself how do i look
8435097 yeah and when you bite stuff its even worse try to keep that to a minimum
8435098 sadly the specimen in the video died shortly after it was caught and placed in a pressure chamber
8435099 okay thats trippy but why do they call it a goblin shark
8435100 are all the problems necessarily the fault of apple or the iphone
8435101 your iphone is out of warranty so you cannot get hardware support just technical support
8435102 im so sorry apple really regrets this happening to users
8435103 you are telling me that my hardware problem started at exactly the same time as the upgrade to 2 0
8435104 well i know it sounds crazy but yes your hardware has gone bad and it just happened to go bad at the same time as the update
8435105 its not supported and you would void any warranty you have
8435106 the years of the major makers shipping out 75 in hardware and selling it for 600 are over
8435107 oh gee there are problems must be the network because in the lab it works fine
8435108 apples coterie is reminiscent of the french jacobin club and its morbid obsession with power death and adversarialism
8435109 you should do it go itll be a good experience

8435115 kami berangkat bersama rasulullah saw pada perang dzatur riqaa kerana marahkan pada tentera islam seorang lelaki musyrik bersumpah akan mengalirkan darah para sahabat muhammad saw pada satu lorong di suatu lembah rasulullah saw bersama para sahabat berhenti
8435116 siapakah di antara kalian yang bersedia menjaga kita malam ini
8435117 maka majulah seorang dari muhajirin dan seorang lagi dari anshar lalu keduanya menjawab
8435118 ketika kedua orang sahabat itu keluar ke mulut lorong sahabat anshar berkata pada sahabat muhajirin
8435119 kemudian sahabat muhajirin itu melompat mencari orang yang melukai sahabat anshar itu
8435120 aku sedang membaca satu surah dan aku tidak ingin memutusnya namun setelah orang itu berkali kali memanahku barulah aku rukuk dan memberitahukan dirimu demi allah swt kalau bukan karena takut mengabaikan tugas penjagaan yang diperintahkan rasulullah saw kepadaku niscaya nafasku akan berhenti sebelum aku membatalkan shalat
8435121 dakwah ini tidak akan dapat dipikul oleh orang orang yang manja
8435122 saya sering ke mana mana dengan teksi dan kereta mewah tapi saya tetap dapat memikul dakwah ini dan saya pun tidak menjadi orang yang manja terhadap dakwah karena itu pakailah duit ini tubuhmu letih dan engkau memerlukan rehat sejenak
8435123 berbahagialah ibu ibu telah berhasil menghadapi ujian allah swt berupa kenikmatan kenikmatan itu namun saya khuatir saya tidak dapat menghadapinya sebagaimana sikap ibu terima kasih atas kebaikan ibu biarlah saya naik public transport saja
8435124 that said we might find something new and compelling about the antarctic setting that wants us to make the next game there but honestly were still at the preliminary stages
8435125 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8435126 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8435127 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8435128 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8435129 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe

8435132 ael 1964 are pleased to announce the completion of yet another outstanding signing with the acquisition of lauren robert the french international midfielder agreed to sign a two year contract bringing his exceptional skills as a footballer to larissa and his enormous experience from his time spent in the french league the english premier league la liga and the french national team
8435133 im happy we could win we had many opportunities in the first half
8435134 at almeria i scored several goals and soon that will happen for the viola
8435135 sunday against juve it will be difficult but we must continue to work and grow i know what it means to play against juventus
8435136 today we subscribe to the alba to culture and to dignity to make hondurans a free people
8435137 honduras and the honduran people do not have to ask permission of any imperialism to join the alba
8435138 i did not come here to meddle in internal affairs but i am just reflecting and i cannot explain how a honduran could be against honduras joining the alba the path of development the path of integration
8435139 is the first summit in honduras and perhaps in the region where the witnesses are not only the top political leaders but also different sectors of the people who not only endorse the alba but also feel that an old historical debt is being paid
8435140 i have been looking for projects with the world bank the inter american development bank europe and i have found very prudent moderated responses
8435141 they do not have emergency funds and this obligates us to move toward new forms of finance like the alba
8435142 une vie de rencontres provoqu es par un immense culot
8435143 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
8435144 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8435145 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8435146 the knowledge worker and the ad hoc use of paper
8435147 the negative is that some teens lack the maturity and judgment to deal with a lot of the information theyre now exposed to its not fair to say that poking sending an online signal to show you find someone attractive makes people promiscuous but there certainly needs to be some policing
8435148 we implemented a self learning system onto the robot for understanding the expressions the self learning system models the process that a baby learns his her parents facial expressions
8435149 its a script that my company red hour got that was written as a live action movie but we thought it would work as an animated movie so we brought it to jeffrey katzenberg and now were in pre production
8435150 vivem sem aquecimento central e n s sabemos como pode ser frio o nosso inverno
8435151 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8435152 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8435153 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8435154 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8435155 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8435156 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8435157 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8435158 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8435159 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8435160 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8435161 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8435162 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8435163 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8435164 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8435165 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8435166 i thought ive been burned by guys like you before ive been burned by politicians before that i wanted to believe in and just didnt live up to it
8435167 i just said i cant deny how i feel about you barack obama
8435168 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8435169 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8435170 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8435171 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8435172 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8435173 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8435174 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8435175 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8435176 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8435177 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8435178 what the body farm found is that there is an indication of human decomposition from the trunk of casey anthonys car
8435179 they are indicating that there certainly was human decomposition in the trunk
8435180 had i known that she would not talk to me coupled with that discovery report no i would not have come to orlando
8435181 patience is the key there will be plenty for you and me
8435182 the morning after our first night together lying in bed in my mans arms i told him i enjoy flirting with guys that i love being the center of attention and that i like doing outrageous things
8435183 he didnt say anything he just smiled shit i thought that was too much for him but he just reached down under his bed and came up with three issues of newcummers seems like ive finally got me a girl wholl pose for my favorite magazine he said ive been fantasizing about it for ages we looked through the mags had sex again and i posed
8435184 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8435185 and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8435186 people will be looking to understand the rationale besides party loyalty and party unity what is the specific rationale behind his support of barack obama
8435187 its like the fascination that young people have here with football
8435188 when we saw crazy gringos taking photos of monkeys we knew we could boost our tourism
8435189 on these rocky roads you get a bus massage my butt is like an aspirin from these roads flat with a line down the middle
8435190 when we saw crazy gringos taking photos of monkeys we knew we could boost our tourism
8435191 on these rocky roads you get a bus massage my butt is like an aspirin from these roads flat with a line down the middle
8435192 when we saw crazy gringos taking photos of monkeys we knew we could boost our tourism
8435193 on these rocky roads you get a bus massage my butt is like an aspirin from these roads flat with a line down the middle
8435194 all books or course materials returns are for store credit only
8435195 you must protect your gift card and treat it as you would cash middlebury college bookstore and middlebury college are not responsible for lost stolen or damaged cards or any unauthorized card use the card is nonrefundable and cannot be redeemed for cash
8435196 we will continually look for ways to reward our most loyal customers who through their purchases have made the decision to keep their money local thus helping to offset the overall cost of education here at middlebury
8435197 incremente la eficiencia de su departamento de soporte t cnico y mesa de ayuda con una herramienta de soporte remoto bajo demanda
8435198 and for continuing the tradition of having a routinely unarmed police service a value closely held by new zealanders
8435199 a friend told me the other day that they were struggling to get enough food and im a bit of a softy when it comes to animals so i thought i would try help out
8435200 these are not the yobbos that the police are interested in
8435201 they dont cause any of the problems that initiated this unfortunate policy in the first place
8435202 after 3am with only three police officers means there must be less problems than before 3am
8435203 the more you can put into a down payment for an sba or other loan the more favorably the lending institution will look on your request
8435204 as a general rule borrowers will need 20 or more down regardless of whether theyre buying a new business or an existing one
8435205 the same account structure that allows for ira monies to be used as loan leverage also allows for multiparty purchases
8435206 youre free to combine your ira money with the ira funds of business partners its also an ideal set up for husband and wife teams
8435207 although its growing remarkably fast this is still a fairly new niche within the self directed ira industry
8435208 so look for a financial services company with a solid history of structuring thousands of these types of accounts and enjoys a reputation for expertise and integrity in the industry
8435209 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8435210 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8435211 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8435212 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8435213 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8435214 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8435215 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8435216 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8435217 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8435218 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8435219 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8435220 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8435221 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8435222 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8435223 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8435224 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8435225 como muchas parejas hemos pasado por uno de esos momentos que nadie quiere que ocurra pero cuando pasan son una especie de invitaci n a reflexionar sobre lo que de verdad queremos tanto mi esposo como yo estamos totalmente enfocados y deseosos que esta relaci n prospere
8435226 como creyentes sabemos que contamos con el apoyo de dios en este proceso esperamos que los medios entiendan esta situaci n y respeten nuestra privacidad y la de nuestras familias
8435227 por nuestra parte nosotros estamos analizando y haciendo cruces con averiguaciones previas para ver si encontramos alg n dato que pudiera ser relevante o que pudiera servir a la autoridad federal
8435228 tambi n permiten atender con mayor eficacia las reglas del juego que los legisladores plasmaron en la constituci n para fortalecer la equidad en la elecci n
8435229 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8435230 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8435231 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8435232 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8435233 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8435234 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8435235 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8435236 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8435237 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8435238 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8435239 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8435240 ha habido problemas a pesar de que se acord el precio base
8435241 vamos a pagarles pero no va a ser como ellos quieran va a ser al ritmo que podamos
8435242 tendr que tomar todas las empresas que ellos techint tienen aqu
8435243 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8435244 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8435245 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8435246 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8435247 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8435248 operating under the influence and leaving the scene of a property damage accident
8435249 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8435250 and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8435251 quite frankly i dont care what john mccain does with his ads
8435252 i think what hes doing is a little silly and trite apparently he doesnt understand that theres an economic crisis evolving in this country
8435253 people will be looking to understand the rationale besides party loyalty and party unity what is the specific rationale behind his support of barack obama
8435254 clinton demonstrated that the well being of the country is more important to her than her own political success
8435255 the choice right now is between more of george bush policies and a change in direction
8435256 by a government that up until now had been unwilling to politically debate the issues around tasers claiming it was an operation matter for police not a political one for mps
8435257 attacked police commissioner howard broad for letting the taser decision which is his be used as a political delaying tactic in parliament yesterday
8435258 are showing the kind of reliability that everyone expected of storage with no moving parts they are just as reliable as rotating disk drives if not more so
8435259 disk drives wear out too but people dont like to talk about that
8435260 the thing about disk drives is you dont know when theyll wear out their average usable life span is five years but the wear out on flash drives is predictable and we believe that predictable wear out is much better than unpredictable wear out
8435261 and the problem of stuck bits can be easily corrected using ecc code
8435262 theres just a lot of bad press about how reliable flash is
8435263 were saying that flash technology is reliable enough for the enterprise
8435264 a lot of consumer ssd products based on flash are using controllers that are very anemic
8435265 were working with the manufacturer of the flash drives to make enterprise ssd controllers
8435266 im 100 behind the idea of getting rid of moving parts whens the last time your usb flash disk stopped working less moving parts equals less failures period
8435267 i wouldnt go giving back my hard drives anytime soon
8435268 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8435269 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8435270 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8435271 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8435272 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8435273 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8435274 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8435275 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8435276 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8435277 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8435278 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8435279 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8435280 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8435281 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8435282 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8435283 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8435284 lol theres to much sh t going on in your sig
8435285 i always try to put myself into things that are more artistic
8435286 i was always very busy going through school and doing other classes
8435287 i always loved doing graphic design and writing for a newspaper or magazine so i figured this would be a great opportunity
8435288 when we first come up with ideas adults arent always receptive
8435289 but once they see that we take it seriously they start to take us seriously
8435290 it was definitely intimidating going in and having them all sitting around
8435291 but they were all very supportive so i didnt feel as nervous as time went on during the meeting
8435292 ex friends falling out with allen ginsberg lionel and diana trilling lillian hellman hannah arendt and norman mailer
8435293 lol theres to much sh t going on in your sig
8435294 eighty percent of the kids we bring over get placed
8435295 weve had 150 kids adopted over the years and 30 more adoptions are in the works
8435296 we help them have a good time without making any promises
8435297 i was a silicon valley sales guy for 21 years i got laid off in 2002 and a week later i was invited to speak at an adoption conference and help lead a bay area hosting program
8435298 our mission is to create an opportunity for kids to meet families we get the word out through churches the media and our network
8435299 in the past we had pursued adoption through santa clara county
8435300 it was very hard to get our foot in the door
8435301 we dont really miss russia because we like this place better
8435302 we like all the fun stuff and all the toys we have
8435303 we get doctor care and we get to go to church and we can get a good education
8435304 they didnt speak any english so we had to deal with translators
8435305 there was a fear of being sent back to the orphanage
8435306 and they would hoard food they would run out of food at the orphanage they didnt understand that you dont run out of food in america
8435307 if you want to win something run a hundred meters if you want to experience something run a marathon
8435308 toda una cultura de trabajo ha quedado destruida porque en los campos de refugiados recib an a diario sus raciones de comida ahora ya no saben c mo ganarse el sustento
8435309 ayudar a estas personas a reorganizar sus vidas tambi n desde el punto de vista espiritual y cultural
8435310 han presenciado el secuestro de sus hijos la violaci n de sus hermanas madres hijas y otras mujeres y c mo asesinaban a personas delante de sus ojos
8435311 los futuros sacerdotes hayan compartido las experiencias de la poblaci n
8435312 dios ha tra do la paz al lograr que las personas se hartaran de la guerra
8435313 tenemos la ntima convicci n de que la guerra ha terminado
8435314 word up soulhonky have you met the sultry vixens of sorority forever yet
8435315 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8435316 generations of the american people have surged through the preambles portal and widened its gate like constitutions amendments are not just words but deeds flesh and blood struggles to redeem americas promise while making amends for some of the sins of our fathers
8435317 first our money the pound or the euro is very strong and because of that the turnover from those countries is heavier than they used to be
8435318 so for ubisoft turnover europe is actually more important than the us now and by more than 5 per cent its become a very strong market for us
8435319 this market has no limit in the growth it can have if we can make sure that the people that are coming in are staying
8435320 i have been very spoiled and get more attention than i deserve
8435321 so i like to see the team interacting more with the press and see questions go from the press straight to the guys who create the ai or lead artist nate simpson whos created this incredible look for the world or mike marr whos now the lead designer on the game
8435322 if people in the press want to interview individuals i love that i think thats the best thing to get the story from the people who are working on the specifics of the game rather than being filtered through me and getting my version of it
8435323 a risk i would rather say its an opportunity if you listened to the keynote speech yesterday david reeves said this is the most important title for next year i believe its an opportunity to expand the market also
8435324 its an opportunity to get people on board with traditional games
8435325 everybody likes stories like characters likes emotions and its an interesting way to get people playing on playstation 3
8435326 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8435327 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8435328 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8435329 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
8435330 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8435331 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8435332 ultimately it gets down to self acceptance if you accept yourself you dont give a damn what anyone else thinks
8435333 no secret anymore the times of del martin and phyllis lyon
8435334 people are carrying out breeding which would be first of all be entirely illegal in humans and secondly is absolutely insane from the point of view of the health of the animals
8435335 in some breeds they are paying a terrible terrible price in genetic disease
8435336 this is a problem thats been getting worse for more than four years
8435337 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8435338 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8435339 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8435340 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8435341 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8435342 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8435343 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8435344 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8435345 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8435346 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8435347 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8435348 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8435349 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8435350 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8435351 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8435352 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8435353 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8435354 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8435355 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8435356 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8435357 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8435358 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8435359 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8435360 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8435361 i always try to put myself into things that are more artistic
8435362 i was always very busy going through school and doing other classes
8435363 i always loved doing graphic design and writing for a newspaper or magazine so i figured this would be a great opportunity
8435364 when we first come up with ideas adults arent always receptive
8435365 but once they see that we take it seriously they start to take us seriously
8435366 it was definitely intimidating going in and having them all sitting around
8435367 but they were all very supportive so i didnt feel as nervous as time went on during the meeting
8435368 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8435369 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8435370 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8435371 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8435372 no one works for someone we all just work together
8435373 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too

8435375 he has a groin problem so he will have an operation and could be out for 10 to 15 days it is not serious but we need to do it now
8435376 he has been playing some games in pain not being 100 fit and we decided that this was the best moment for the operation
8435377 he had a problem for the first game with liege and also when he went away to play for england in their friendly last week against the czech republic
8435378 we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain but now we will have to get the situation solved

8435400 contributive efforts are better because you are not relying on one individual
8435401 you will get individual performances brilliantly but its always better to win through a team effort everyone can enjoy it that way
8435402 contributive efforts are better because you are not relying on one individual
8435403 you will get individual performances brilliantly but its always better to win through a team effort everyone can enjoy it that way
8435404 its just not fair that she didnt get to go past the fifth grade she only got to go to four days of fifth grade she just loved school so much and some of the kids dont like school and are mean to each other its just not fair
8435405 really i thought she went like five months or something youre right thats not very long
8435406 the cameras catch everything being sophisticated enough to zoom in real up close and personal with people and seeing things going on
8435407 this is down inside our loading docks so all of our loads that come in from trucks
8435408 the atrium the outside parking lots in the bowl the stores its all covered so hopefully we can see things coming and be proactive and send security or officers to that location if something is happening
8435409 families should be able to feel comfortable to take their kids and wives to the game and not be spilled on or vomited on things of that nature that occur frequently unfortunately
8435410 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8435411 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8435412 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8435413 quiet guy keeps his cool no drama does his job comes up big
8435414 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8435415 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8435416 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8435417 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8435418 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8435419 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8435420 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8435421 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8435422 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8435423 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8435424 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8435425 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8435426 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8435427 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8435428 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8435429 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8435430 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8435431 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8435432 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8435433 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8435434 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8435435 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8435436 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8435437 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8435438 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8435439 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8435440 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8435441 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8435442 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8435443 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8435444 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8435445 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8435446 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8435447 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8435448 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8435449 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8435450 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8435451 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8435452 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8435453 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8435454 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8435455 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8435456 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8435457 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8435458 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8435459 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8435460 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8435461 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8435462 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8435463 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8435464 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8435465 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8435466 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8435467 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8435468 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8435469 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8435470 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8435471 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8435472 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8435473 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8435474 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8435475 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8435476 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8435477 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8435478 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8435479 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8435480 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8435481 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8435482 new zealand is facing a serious economic challenge generated by the global credit crunch and steep rises in global commodity prices
8435483 these are the most complex and challenging set of economic forces we have confronted in at least two decades
8435484 the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8435485 lets hope we do not see any direct confrontation in that
8435486 hey im a deep sleeper this is new for me

8435495 los rollos contienen los textos en hebreo m s antiguos que se conocen a d a de hoy constan de novecientos manuscritos y contienen todos los libros del antiguo testamento excepto el libro de esther y varios textos ap crifos y escrituras de sectas
8435496 se escribieron cuando tanto el juda smo como el cristianismo se estaban empezando a concebir tal y como los conocemos ahora
8435497 hasta ahora hab a muy poco acceso a im genes de los rollos del mar muerto las pocas fotos que hay son en blanco y negro y datan de los a os cincuenta porque despu s de esa fecha s lo se ha permitido fotografiar pedazos de los pergaminos en casos muy puntuales para su conservaci n o investigaci n
8435498 son de inter s no s lo para los investigadores sino tambi n para el p blico general
8435499 la tecnolog a desarrollada por la nasa tambi n permitir hacer un mejor seguimiento de la conservaci n de los rollos
8435500 los textos fueron escritos en el tiempo en que vivi jes s y en concreto los ap crifos y sectarios son muy cercanos al pensamiento de los primeros cristianos y muy parecidos al nuevo testamento que se escribi un siglo m s tarde que estos manuscritos
8435501 la mayor parte de la gente que visita la exposici n de los rollos del mar muerto en jerusal n son cristianos
8435502 delays beyond the normal period are generally caused by reports that are incomplete or contain errors these reports need to be manually checked and confirmed by inland revenue staff and this can be time consuming
8435503 shake off the funk and commit to making good times happen again
8435504 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8435505 after the new release of the iphone 2 1 software which supports flash and flash video playback an increasing number of masturbation in public spaces such as libraries and subways have been reported
8435506 most serious developers make iphone friendly versions of their sites anyway
8435507 when contacted by the asa apple said it built the safari web browser on the iphone using open standards and that it could not reasonably assure compatibility with every third party plug in or technology on the market
8435508 oh thats a load of apple can do no wrong and the iphone is the best piece of technology ever created wahhh
8435509 the scenario is based on the collapse of a building due to an explosion and is designed to test the response of the citys emergency services mr cox said
8435510 a prop has been constructed by the tasmania fire service in a large shed at the launceston show society in invermay to create a scene where urban search and rescue teams will be exposed to the dangers and difficulties associated with on site treatment of casualties and their extraction over a lengthy period of time from the collapsed building site
8435511 the difficulties confronting the rescuers will be compounded by the presence of toxic substances from exploding agents that caused the collapse of the multi story building
8435512 emergency service personnel will have to take into account the chemical contamination and along with treating the injured will have to decontaminate people rescued as well as the rescuers themselves to ensure no one suffers chemical after effects
8435513 a real life disaster of this magnitude does not bear thinking about however it is imperative that our emergency services undergo such simulations so that they can provide the very best response in the unlikely event such an emergency occurs

8435750 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8435751 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8435810 today we actually have people who come and watch our matches
8435811 at first it seems a little complex because its like a one inning baseball game where everyone gets to bat
8435812 cricket is a game that demands more patience and teamwork than baseball
8435813 in baseball heroes hit home runs in cricket there are no walk off home runs
8435814 in cricket you have to play as a team and you have to play with cooperation and endurance
8435815 this factor of non involvement of individuals for a long game it can make cricket uninteresting to newcomers
8435816 during the semester every first hour of our practices are offered as a clinic where we teach people about the sport
8435817 we showed them how cricket can be modified to suit the needs of a physical education curriculum
8435818 in cricket as batter when you are out youre out for the whole game

8435825 there are things i wish id urged her to do things i wish i had said things i wish i hadnt said but i am not a racist i never made a racist comment and i didnt attack him personally
8435826 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year he clearly can inspire and motivate people and energize them which is a very important part of being president and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
8435827 our assessment that iran halted the program in 2003 primarily in response to international pressure indicates tehrans decisions are guided by a cost benefit approach rather than a rush to a weapon irrespective of the political economic and military costs this in turn suggests that some combination of threats of intensified international scrutiny and pressures along with opportunities for iran to achieve its security prestige and goals for regional influence in other ways might if perceived by irans leaders as credible prompt tehran to extend the current halt to its nuclear weapons program it is difficult to specify what such a combination might be
8435828 we assess with moderate confidence that convincing the iranian leadership to forgo the eventual development of nuclear weapons will be difficult given the linkage many within the leadership probably see between nuclear weapons development and irans key national security and foreign policy objectives and given irans considerable effort from at least the late 1980s to 2003 to develop such weapons in our judgment only an iranian political decision to abandon a nuclear weapons objective would plausibly keep iran from eventually producing nuclear weapons and such a decision is inherently reversible
8435829 we judge with moderate confidence that the earliest possible date iran would be technically capable of producing enough heu for a weapon is late 2009 but that this is very unlikely
8435830 we judge with moderate confidence iran probably would be technically capable of producing enough heu for a weapon sometime during the 2010 2015 time frame inr judges iran is unlikely to achieve this capability before 2013 because of foreseeable technical and programmatic problems all agencies recognize the possibility that this capability may not be attained until after 2015

8435834 at the same time advisers said mrs clinton wanted to ensure that her star turn at the convention could never be portrayed as insufficiently enthusiastic should mr obama lose the election in part because swaths of her supporters ultimately did not vote for him mrs clinton is almost certain to run for president in 2012 if mr obama fails this time several clinton advisers said tuesday and any such plan could possibly founder if the clintons negative feelings show through this year
8435835 by the time she was done sen clinton had delivered a strong convincing affirmation of obama and just as importantly a thumping of mccain she did her part her husband takes the stage wednesday and then obama must make his case to the american people that he will be ready on day one
8435836 clinton seemed to say even if obama is everything she said during the campaign hes still a better man than mccain the speech was as much of an attack on mccain as it was an embrace of obama we dont need four more years of the last eight years she said
8435837 in an address closely scrutinized for perceived slights against obama clinton threw herself fully behind the man she battled and often criticized during a long and at times bitter primary campaign
8435838 this was a clinton speech that didnt require any parsing of words in a fiery call to arms last night hillary clinton tried to clear up the one thing that hadnt been clear before her level of enthusiasm for making barack obama president in past speeches she has offered sincere endorsements of obama but then gone on to extol the accomplishments of her own campaign this time perhaps sensing a greater urgency she offered repeated appeals on obamas behalf
8435839 this is a unified party this is a unified convention
8435840 and in 2008 he mccain still thinks its ok when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8435841 the facts in april senate republicans killed legislation aimed at removing limits on how long workers can wait before suing their employers for pay discrimination the bill was designed to address a supreme court decision that threw out a discrimination case brought by an alabama woman mccain said he opposed the measure because it would lead to more lawsuits although he was campaigning that day and did not vote
8435842 well i hate to admit it but i think i agree
8435843 jon mccain claims to be a republican who understands the risks of global warming so you would think he would have an energy policy other than drill drill drill but john mccain doesnt care
8435844 john mccain is a veteran so you would think he would have supported jim webbs new gi bill of rights but john mccain doesnt care
8435845 john mccain wanted more american troops in iraq to quell the violence after all their sacrifices you would think he would at least expect the iraqis to pass the laws needed to unite their country but john mccain doesnt care
8435846 john mccain helped pass mccain feingold so you would think he would not have a campaign run by lobbyists but john mccain doesnt care
8435847 the bill was designed to address a supreme court decision that threw out a discrimination case brought by an alabama woman
8435848 warner rebuked president bush and gop nominee to be john mccain but his address was hardly a summons to political arms against them he mentioned mccains name only twice and he said hed learned in the cell phone business that made him millions that a strategy of tearing down the competition doesnt suffice
8435849 former virginia gov mark warner the keynote speaker at a democratic convention that has so far come down to two glowing stars one revered warhorse and a lot of single battery flashlights exuded the quiet confidence of a man who wouldnt be surprised to find himself back at the same podium someday in a different situation
8435850 the best way to watch a political convention is on c span that way americans can make their own judgments unfiltered without being told what to think by the nattering nabobs of tv commentary
8435851 oh they really should have gone in the other direction
8435852 the latest narrative making its way around the democratic convention here is that the obama campaign hasnt learned the lesson of john kerrys 2004 convention in which the nominee failed to directly attack president bush
8435853 leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground msm stop distorting and creating issues for the purpose of selling your ideas cheeto joe scarbough is still spewing is right wing wacko agenda how many times and many people must appeal to you here the rap
8435854 mrs clinton is almost certain to run for president in 2012 if mr obama fails this time several clinton advisers said tuesday and any such plan could possibly founder if the clintons negative feelings show through this year
8435855 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8435856 whether its been rooting out corruption in politics fighting global climate change or calling for a new strategy in iraq john mccain has a record of making bipartisan change and barack obama does not
8435857 mccain still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8435858 the more alaskans saw of parnell the less they liked him
8435859 its actually a good example of how no good deed goes unpunished by her staff and its another reminder of how undisciplined her campaign would be right now had she won the dem nomination

8435863 a hero is always willing to perform an act of self sacrifice for the greater good
8435864 it seems as if the democratic convention so far has delivered on every single thing theyve set out to do how do you counter that

8435872 a serendipitous finding of our research is that the physical removal of a fingermark fingerprint from a metal surface eg by rubbing with a tissue may not necessarily mean that all the fingermark pattern information is lost
8435873 what youve leaving is an impression of your fingerprint ridges in sweat
8435874 the challenge has been incorporating it into the day job
8435875 its notoriously difficult to enhance fingerprints on brass gun cartridge cases what you really want is the fingerprint of the guy who loaded the gun not somebody who could say i picked up the spent cartridge case in the road after it had been fired thats the key evidence youre after who loaded the gun
8435876 if you heat the metal up after you put the fingerprint on corrosion takes place instantaneously
8435877 anything left is the result of some chemical reaction initially between the fingerprint deposit and the metal
8435878 all casings have been subject to conventional fingerprint enhancement with negative result
8435879 on one case i was able to develop a very partial fingerprint needless to say the guys in boulder were amazed that we had turned anything up
8435880 i do not really see any disadvantages and if it allows to detect even one print where other techniques fail this can be described as a success
8435881 its not a frequent occurrence but this isnt the first time

8435984 many attackers have found creative ways to entice humans to unknowingly solve the captchas for them

8435988 improvements include new image distortion logic overlapping characters and dynamic monitoring capabilities to observe attacks in real time and make necessary adjustments to mitigate them in addition we continue to make advances to better prevent spammers from using hotmail accounts once created to successfully send spam
8435989 the huge increase in numbers of legitimate sites affected radically changes traditional trust relationships on the web
8435990 steering clear of dubious sites has always been sound advice but steering clear of legitimate sites is not an option
8435991 theres probably going to have to be some kind of layered security
8435992 its up to the industry sectors which and how many layers of security they wish to employ dependent on what sort of site they have
8435993 ultimately captchas are useless for spam because theyre designed to tell you if someone is human or not but not whether something is spam or not just because something came from a real human being doesnt mean it isnt spam which is why content based solutions like akismet are the only long term solution to the spam problem

8436097 we were all delighted here at global publishing with the buzz in the industry leading up to the event and the amazing turn out at our silver anniversary celebrations
8436098 its a big indication of who we are where weve come from over the last 25 years and where were heading
8436099 we continue to enjoy strong sales in australia and new zealand and are proud to be on sale internationally from johannesburg to new york and this is our greatest achievement
8436100 they have no more bread why dont they eat brioche
8436101 he says the intent of his bill is to overturn the hard fought for bill last year that allowed for the federal government to help out the state governments in prosecuting their internet gambling bans
8436102 however this bill would go even further to overturn state laws and federalize the whole issue
8436103 when youre talking about internet gambling its this huge over a hundred billion dollar industry
8436104 and a lot of the money we dont know where it goes its untraceable
8436105 is going into money laundering and covering up drug smuggling and even terrorist activities
8436106 i think gambling is immoral therefore no one should do it therefore this bill is bad
8436107 i just think he doesnt have the temperament to be president
8436108 do i have the ability to speak with experience about someone who has abused everyone hes dealt with
8436109 there isnt a republican serving in the senate thats happy hes the nominee now theyre all supporting him but ill tell you they have told me ive had republican senators tell me they dont think theyll vote for him
8436110 barack obamas own running mate knows hes not qualified to be commander in chief
8436111 this argument would get you laughed out of a court of law
8436112 since you havent even said what youre talking about much less puit forward any evidence
8436113 so what does this mean apart from a possible comment to grl it means that whether 2003 was wildly exceptional or not depends on how you look at it its widely publicised impacts were all in terms of the surface so its perhaps unsurprising that when you measure something other than the surface it becomes less exceptional
8436114 there are two types and it would be easy to get them confused
8436115 the latter is less well observed depending on whose dataset you pick its either bigger than or about as big as the sfc warming w
8436116 the data is exactly as i said it is of course
8436117 the last post was a post too far because im supposing he just had no answer for it with that post ive won decisively
8436118 firstly the reconstructions of solar irradiance from different methods differ widely
8436119 oh dear this is all a bit one step forward and two steps back
8436120 you do see indications of the solar cycle if you begin by looking at the right metric which is obviously the energy imbedded in the oceans
8436121 then we would have to assume that all aerosols black and white are reducing the amount of energy being punched deep into the ocean
8436122 this agreement will extend and enhance our already successful long standing collaboration with nikon and will allow us to provide even better products to our customers
8436123 this agreement is another great example of how industry leaders are coming together to collaborate through intellectual property licensing and by doing so enabling innovation that will ultimately benefit the consumer
8436124 we are proud of the quality of our broad global patent portfolio and we are pleased to be working with an industry leader such as nikon
8436125 at nikon we want to continue to lead the industry in pioneering photography solutions and give our customers access to innovative technology
8436126 this agreement is a natural extension of our long standing relationship with microsoft and we look forward to collaborating and bringing exciting new products to the market
8436127 he still claims the movie is opening on 1000 screens on april 18 he said they would consider the opening weekend successful if the movie sold 2 million tickets earning 12 15 million
8436128 i am emailing to let you know that we have cancelled the milwaukee screening of expelled on april 8th the producers of the film are very busy preparing for the films release in theaters april 18th and due to unavoidable changes in their schedules they are unable to make it out to milwaukee for this screening
8436129 hes the dick to the dawk to the phd hes smarter than you
8436130 he still claims the movie is opening on 1000 screens on april 18 he said they would consider the opening weekend successful if the movie sold 2 million tickets earning 12 15 million
8436131 tell me do you honestly honestly believe some guy was walking around the theater with a night vision scope
8436132 didnt i tell you that to fill in the title section of the registratiuon form as pastor or youth group leader filling in the blank as darwinist satan worshipper or doctor of anthropolgy not so good
8436133 does anyone know if they held the screening originally scheduled for april 1 in owings mills md
8436134 i do have to give you guys some credit though no one whos visited my blog has resorted to leaving vulgar substanceless comments
8436135 arent satan worshippers also xians its the same belief system
8436136 if there were night vision scopes they were probably used to find pirateers recording the movie the producers have been a bit touchy about this issue
8436137 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time

8436181 the s 300 system which has a radius of over 90 miles and effective altitudes of about 90 000 feet is capable of tracking up to 100 targets simultaneously
8436182 it is considered one of the best in the world and is amazingly versatile it is capable of shooting down aircraft cruise missiles and ballistic missile warheads
8436183 the deployment of the anti aircraft shield next spring if it occurs effectively limits the window in which israel or the united states could conduct an effective aerial campaign aimed at destroying delaying or crippling the iranian nuclear program
8436184 many of the iranian targets are fortified and will require bunker busters

8436422 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8436423 that should not take away from their great qualities as pioneers and doers
8436424 then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots

8436426 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8436427 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8436428 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8436429 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8436430 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
8436431 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
8436432 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
8436433 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8436434 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8436435 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8436436 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8436437 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush

8436441 not only because people seemed to really appreciate it but because talking to farmers was like some kind of therapy so nice and relaxing made me want to quit journalism and become a farmer
8436442 im hoping california is like one big headhouse market everywhere you look fruits and veggies even if its not that way im going to have a little yard out there and i plan to start a garden so i will send you a tomato and you can decide
8436443 the american people are dumb enough to give the republicans another shot
8436444 encourage users to analyze comment on and even challenge washingtonpost coms articles
8436445 everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler
8436446 use it up wear it out make it do or do without
8436447 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8436448 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8436449 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8436450 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8436451 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8436452 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8436453 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8436454 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8436455 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8436456 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8436457 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8436458 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8436459 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8436460 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8436461 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8436462 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8436463 i need to show that i can pitch up at this level and go seven innings
8436464 it was a good win for us we needed that win
8436465 perkins had a good outing he just made a couple mistakes the one to ibanez that he left hanging there and then the one to lopez ended up in the seats as well other than that he threw the ball great gave us a great opportunity to win today
8436466 i was deciding do i poverty to hit added baby do i poverty to hit an affair or go backwards to school thats when gospels was conceived we had proven for 16 eld and no baby so gospels was a bounteous surprise
8436467 dia memang bayar ppn tetapi direstitusi kemudian pajak penjualan tidak bayar itu artinya tidak bayar pajak
8436468 i feel like wolfslair can make me go farther than i have been im really excited about being able to travel there to train the guys on the team they like to laugh and joke around but they train hard and thats me thats what i like to do
8436469 i like the tea i like the birds english slang for women and i like the culture im looking forward to learning a lot more about british culture because america really doesnt have one laughs
8436470 every fighter will tell you that their next fight is the most important and that wont change here
8436471 fighters can make or break their careers with a few good or bad fights so im not going to let any fight slip by
8436472 i had all the upper tier fighters on his plateau and i thought that i was far off getting a big win like that let me know that i could compete at that level
8436473 the ultimate fighter was great for me because it put me on television in front of everyone
8436474 on the local level mma shows are filled by fighters selling tickets to their friends
8436475 you always try to have a worst case scenario opponent in mind while training and bj is just that
8436476 i learned from that fight that i need to pace myself better and not think that i have to go all out from bell to bell
8436477 it was real tough in colorado with the elevation i tried to prepare for it but i didnt do enough it was a costly lesson but one that i will never make again

8436484 unless we put in place systems that ensure safety of patients and good quality of trials people will get away with whatever they can get away with
8436485 if her supporters vote for mccain they were never democrats anyway or they re clueless like the former clinton supporter in the republican ad who mistakenly thought mccain was pro choice on abortion
8436486 but they seem to be beyond the concern of a national administration which can think in terms only of the top of the social and economic structure it has sought temporary relief from the top down rather than permanent relief from the bottom up it has totally failed to plan ahead in a comprehensive way it has waited until something has cracked and then at the last moment has sought to prevent total collapse it is high time to get back to fundamentals it is high time to admit with courage that we are in the midst of an emergency at least equal to that of war let us mobilize to meet it
8436487 this is where i went against the trend and changed things and this is what i accomplished here i showed courage worked hard and against the odds accomplished something that made a difference in peoples lives
8436488 if her supporters vote for mccain they were never democrats anyway
8436489 america can t afford to have such a conceited self serving person in the presidency
8436490 however he is too liberal too young and has no resume
8436491 obamas different than most americans people cant identify with him

8436503 very proud that the movie is surviving the nonsense people are getting to see the movie its sort of starting to have a cult life
8436504 made a f ing great movie and the politics that are being visited upon it have nothing to do with the movie at all this is all about ego and though i mourn the fact that midnight meat train was never given its chance in theaters its a beautifully stylish scary movie and it isnt going anywhere people will find it and whether they find it in midnight shows or they find it on dvd theyll find it and in the end the joe drakes of the world will disappear

8436513 the company strongly believes it is important to ramp up marketing to educate and encourage customers to convert to natural gas
8436514 you have to go out and get them and help them over that initial hurdle of the cost of getting on the system
8436515 the economic attractiveness of natural gas service has never been greater
8436516 the notion that national grid needs more funding of its marketing efforts to compete with heating oil marketers is at best questionable
8436517 serious and lasting damage to the us uk intelligence sharing relationship and thus the national security of the uk
8436518 no movement on the central question where was mr mohamed between 2002 and 2004
8436519 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8436520 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8436521 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8436522 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8436523 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8436524 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8436525 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8436526 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8436527 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8436528 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8436529 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8436530 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8436531 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8436532 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8436533 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8436534 the next six months are going to tell the story
8436535 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8436536 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8436537 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8436538 i mean really does that look like it will fit me
8436539 oh no we dont use tape measures here lets have a look at them then
8436540 i mean really does that look like it will fit me
8436541 oh no we dont use tape measures here lets have a look at them then
8436542 his past is littered with arrests and prison time including a conviction for raping a boy at gunpoint in 1980
8436543 duncan has told investigators he killed two half sisters from seattle in 1996 slayings and he is charged with killing a young boy in riverside county calif in 1997
8436544 i was deciding do i want to have another baby do i want to have an affair or go back to school thats when matthew was conceived we had tried for 16 years and no baby so matthew was a big surprise
8436545 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8436546 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8436547 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8436548 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8436549 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8436550 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8436551 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8436552 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8436553 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8436554 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8436555 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8436556 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8436557 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8436558 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8436559 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8436560 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8436561 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8436562 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8436563 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8436564 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8436565 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8436566 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8436567 no my life is not better off in fact it is worse
8436568 i dont use liberal talking points i excrete liberal talking points
8436569 i dont use liberal talking points i create liberal talking points
8436570 he also says listing to his one sided rhetoric that comes to you via radio station filled with one sided propagandist looking to get rich by blindly riding off his coattail
8436571 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
8436572 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
8436573 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
8436574 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
8436575 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
8436576 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
8436577 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
8436578 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8436579 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8436580 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8436581 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
8436582 in preseason they have to play and get ready to go but you just kind of hold your breath all the time last week there were some really good players that got hurt around the nfl and you just hope it doesnt happen to you
8436583 oh i was surprised i didnt know what was going on
8436584 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8436585 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8436586 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8436587 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8436588 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8436589 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8436590 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8436591 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8436592 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8436593 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8436594 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8436595 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8436596 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8436597 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8436598 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8436599 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8436600 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8436601 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8436602 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8436603 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8436604 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8436605 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8436606 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8436607 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
8436608 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
8436609 in a move that has outraged the legal community lawyers organizations and the opposition pakistan muslim league n the pakistan peoples party led government on wednesday restored eight judges of the sindh high court from among the 60 dismissed by the former president pervez musharraf in november 2007
8436610 this is a conspiracy aimed at dividing the judges and lawyers
8436611 this is our convention this is our party and barack obama is our candidate to deliver the change we need
8436612 there are supposed to be 5 000 hostile individuals coming toward us
8436613 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
8436614 in the nfl and specifically third string quarterbacking one day youre in the next day youre out
8436615 apple said the aim of the ad was to highlight the benefit of the iphone in being able to offer availability to all internet websites in contrast to other handsets which offered access to wap versions or sites selected by service providers they believed that surfing the internet with an iphone was similar to surfing from a home or office computer and the appearance and the websites that could be visited were the same they said this was different from accessing the internet using an ordinary mobile phone handset which often only allowed the user to visit wap enabled sites that were simplified versions of the websites they said they understood that some mobile service providers limited the range of sites available to subscribers or only allowed them to visit the wap versions they said the iphone which was only available through one service provider had full internet access
8436616 the asa noted that java and flash proprietary software was not enabled on the iphone and understood that users would therefore be unable to access certain features on some websites or websites that relied solely on flash or java
8436617 youll never know which part of the internet youll need

8436619 my job takes me to a lot of places the work is steady the moneys good
8436620 but why are we so obsessed with the guys with the guns
8436621 the two hijackers were transported to one of the halls at kufrah airport after giving themselves up
8436622 e eu quero conhecer os leitores e leitoras do contraditorium em alguns casos biblicamente
8436623 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8436624 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8436625 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8436626 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8436627 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8436628 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8436629 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8436630 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8436631 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8436632 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8436633 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8436634 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8436635 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8436636 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8436637 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8436638 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8436639 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8436640 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8436641 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8436642 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8436643 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8436644 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8436645 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8436646 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8436647 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8436648 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8436649 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8436650 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8436651 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8436652 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8436653 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8436654 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8436655 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8436656 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8436657 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8436658 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8436659 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8436660 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8436661 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8436662 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8436663 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8436664 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8436665 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8436666 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8436667 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8436668 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8436669 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8436670 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8436671 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8436672 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8436673 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8436674 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8436675 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8436676 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8436677 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8436678 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8436679 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
8436680 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8436681 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm

8436683 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8436684 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends

8436686 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8436687 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8436688 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8436689 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8436690 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8436691 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8436692 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8436693 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8436694 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8436695 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8436696 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8436697 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8436698 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8436699 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8436700 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

8436703 they pride themselves on being a new breed of news delivery
8436704 media organizations pay hundreds of thousands to millions for photos and video footage
8436705 people magazine notoriously paid over 10 million for brad pitt and angelina jolies baby photos
8436706 it looks like wikileaks is still looking for the optimal method to distribute its materials
8436707 i think it will automatically rule out publications like the new york times and others that might devote significant attention to an in depth look at such internal e mails but would not pay for them
8436708 whether u s media outlets are cheap or have ethics i dont know
8436709 the degree to which news organizations refuse to pay for the news is proportional to the degree to which they are able to bilk the public with unworthy alternatives
8436710 indeed for anyone who has been in the news business for a while knows manufacture of news is so arbitrary the result must be described primarily as mere entertainment
8436711 good for them we live in a capitalist country everything has a dollar value even ethical behavior so get over it lets see what is going on behind the scenes with hugo and the gang
8436712 computer or digital forensic services or in the acquisition review or analysis of digital or computer based information whether for purposes of obtaining or furnishing information for evidentiary or other purposes or for providing expert testimony before a court
8436713 investigation and expert testimony in computer forensics and network testing should be based upon the current state of science and technology best practices in the industry and knowledge skills and education of the expert
8436714 the public and courts will be negatively impacted if e discovery forensic investigations network testing and other computer services can be performed only by licensed private investigators because not all licensed private investigators are qualified to perform computer forensic services and many qualified computer forensic professionals would be excluded because they are not licensed
8436715 computer forensic assignments often require handling data in multiple jurisdictions for example data may need to be imaged from hard drives in new york texas and michigan
8436716 does the person performing that work need to have licenses in all three states

8436721 in the new innovation model research needs to keep addressing the need of the mother company
8436722 say in the case of integrated circuits there were many many small steps that occurred along the way resulting from decades worth of work in matters of physics
8436723 so the measure of time and the frequency standards that are used to do it date back to research in optical pumping which led to the development of hydrogen maser
8436724 bell labs could do the kind of fundamental research it did in the past because it was functioning as part of a monopoly
8436725 i dont care about the individual praise and i am not worried about the comparison with ole
8436726 it is a team effort and i played a part in winning the trophy that is the only thing that counts
8436727 as an individual i would rather save the important one but if somebody else had scored the winner i would have been just as happy as i was when i saved anelkas penalty
8436728 at this stage of my career it is all about prizes and enjoying it as much as possible
8436729 it wont take a big mental effort to win it again
8436730 we have loads of professional players here and they all want to win especially the big ones so we do not need any extra effort
8436731 but to reach another final would be tremendous with ajax we lost too many players due to injury it was the same at united in the semi final two years ago
8436732 you just need a few things to go your way
8436733 with the national team i gave everything and now i am focused completely on united hopefully that will prolong my career whether this year or next
8436734 i am enjoying myself now more than i have ever done
8436735 in 1995 i won the champions league and reached the final again the following year at that age you think it is normal
8436736 in a way it has fallen for us quite nicely that we only have two league games in the first four or five weeks of the season
8436737 when we do have to play these games hopefully everyone will be back fit which wont be too bad at all
8436738 it will be a difficult season because there are various things for us to cope with not least going to tokyo for the world club championship in december which means another game will be called off
8436739 so hopefully we are suffering all the injuries at the start of the season
8436740 championships and trophies are based upon the base you have at the back
8436741 we have always had players who can score goals but the consistency we had with edwin and the back four last year breeds confidence throughout the team
8436742 if it is 0 0 with 10 minutes to go you still have a good chance of winning
8436743 with a tough economic environment resulting in skyrocketing newsprint and fuel costs along with softening in certain classified segments the missoulian has been faced with very tough financial decisions not dissimilar to many other businesses in our community and our industry
8436744 the pfa who represent james milner are disappointed that information regarding his request for a move and the circumstances surrounding it have come to the publics attention and we feel we have no option but to respond
8436745 the facts are that james transfer request was actually handed in on wednesday august 20 at which point it was asked by newcastle to keep the matter private
8436746 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club
8436747 there was a meeting between the owner and all relevant people at the club today when we believed james request was to be discussed
8436748 to clarify the situation james did sign a contract 12 months ago however this agreement was reached with the club nearly 12 months previous at the point at which newcastle had agreed to sell james to aston villa on transfer deadline day 2006 before cancelling the agreement at the 11th hour
8436749 since then he has played over 80 games for newcastle all james wanted was a deal that reflected his development and that was in line with newcastles transfer valuation of him
8436750 whilst james does have three years left on his current agreement it is common practice that when a young player signs a long term contract this is reviewed and improved on a regular basis with a players development but equally it protects the clubs position in regard to their transfer value
8436751 although the transfer request was handed in seven days ago james has been professional in keeping the matter private whilst giving strong performances for newcastle
8436752 we are looking at all candidates and we must see what comes of that
8436753 but every club immediately blocks their doors they have no more than four of five days to sign a new striker themselves too its an awkward task
8436754 i wish i could tell you who we will sign if we go for a new striker he may well be very different to stefan
8436755 we were introduced to jeffrey spokes work by broken trinity writer ron marz and i was immediately taken by his incredible sense of design and artistry
8436756 were incredibly proud to offer jeffreys three covers for broken trinity as the unbroken beautifully iconic piece he originally envisioned
8436757 we think they are collecting money going to fund other projects onshore we can say they are doing this on behalf of organized crime and for terrorist activities
8436758 its been a tremendous experience but im going to be honest with you the profession is dying mariotti said
8436759 i dont think either paper sun times and chicago tribune is going to survive
8436760 to showcase your work you need a stellar website and if a newspaper doesnt have that you cant be stuck in the 20th century with your old newspaper
8436761 its been a tremendous experience but im going to be honest with you the profession is dying mariotti said

8436767 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8436768 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8436769 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8436770 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8436771 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8436772 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8436773 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8436774 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8436775 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8436776 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8436777 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8436778 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8436779 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8436780 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8436781 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8436782 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8436783 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8436784 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8436785 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8436786 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8436787 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8436788 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8436789 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8436790 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8436791 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8436792 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8436793 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8436794 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8436795 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8436796 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8436797 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8436798 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8436799 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8436800 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8436801 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8436802 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8436803 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8436804 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8436805 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8436806 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
8436807 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
8436808 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8436809 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8436810 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8436811 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8436812 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8436813 really youre focused youre listening and getting a feel for the hall you havent been there you dont quite have that same feel as if youd been there for a few hours even
8436814 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8436815 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8436816 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8436817 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8436818 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8436819 starting photography is a hands on book for photographers just starting their love affair with photography
8436820 there is a lot of technical information that will give you a good grounding in photography covering both traditional darkroom techniques and digital methods projects allow further exploration of themes and are a good way of extending your mastery of the camera
8436821 at last there is an introductory book that i can unreservedly recommend to friends students and others who are in any way interested in the basics of photography and digital photography

8436825 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats
8436826 he who climbs fuji once is wise he who climbs it twice is a fool
8436827 as we reduce the size of our fleet and take other actions to enable united to compete in this environment of record fuel prices we must take the difficult but necessary steps to reduce the number of people we have to run our operation
8436828 i joke and say those two craniotomies i had for these aneurysms they took the top of my head off
8436829 you cannot go to a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
8436830 sen biden words have in the past gotten you in trouble words that were borrowed and words that some found hateful can you reassure voters in this country that you would have the discipline you would need on the world stage senator
8436831 well that hes black and you know weve never had a black president theyre just against that
8436832 they dont want him in there cause his name sounds like the other country
8436833 this is a democratic county this part of the state so why isnt barack obama an easy sell
8436834 i still think its because people dont know him that well thats what i think
8436835 hes on tv all the time hes got commercials here
8436836 yes but probably race is an issue for some people still
8436837 we need to put the right person in the white house
8436838 race is its one of the touchiest most sensitive subjects in american culture and life and its going to play a role in this election both to help obama and hurt obama
8436839 there is no question even though racial prejudice has decreased over time there is still some of it out there and it will show up at the polls
8436840 will there be some folks who probably dont vote for me because i am black of course yeah but the question is can we get a majority of the american people to give us a fair hearing
8436841 thats all youre doing to me he is the man for the job right now we have to change something in this country it has to be done now we cant wait the average workers were just getting burned
8436842 it doesnt matter what color you are just do your job thats it
8436843 we have selected the best possible team for this game which we hope will bring us the three points that we need
8436844 this is an important game because we are fighting to qualify for the final round in angola
8436845 we have tried to balance the team by bringing a lot of experience into this selection as this is going to be a very difficult game
8436846 we are well aware that the football season has just begun for most of our players around the world which means there is still opportunity for players to show us what they can do for the country
8436847 i think there are still some players that will come forward from this season
8436848 may i add that a win against nigeria will not mean we should get carried away
8436849 but it is a game which is as important as the one against equatorial guinea and all the friendly games that we still have to play because we must not lose sight of the bigger picture which is the 2010 world cup
8436850 we must continue to build and find the best players to present a world class team by the time of the 2010 world cup
8436851 i want to prepare a strong team and see what will happen this time
8436852 if it is a jinx i can assure you it is going to end this time but i dont perceive it to be one because we were the better side in windhoek and only lacked concentration in the dying minutes
8436853 most of them dont even know about our record with namibia and all they want is to win and win comfortably
8436854 vice president lyndon johnson and president john f kennedy leave the airport in houston on nov 21 1963
8436855 i was able to get an extra ticket but most of the stars dont meet the fans anymore
8436856 then he gave her a hug autographed a program and the two talked hes very personable and interacts well with his fans
8436857 they said of all the athletes in special olympics she was the one they wanted for the ad
8436858 they gave her outfits for the shoot brought her to the beach and really treated her like a celebrity
8436859 they even gave her a radio controlled car and promised to give her a real one when she got her license
8436860 when that happened i went from being a coach back to being mom
8436861 i rushed to her side and she calmly asked me to step aside and let the medics do their job so she could get back to the competition
8436862 she had fluid building up in her ears and that was impeding her speech abilities
8436863 we had that drained and she hasnt stopped talking since
8436864 shell be doing a variety of things like sorting fishing tackle or placing inserts in the newspaper
8436865 since amanda was born people have always tried to hold her back
8436866 but she keeps rewriting the rules were all very proud of her
8436867 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8436868 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8436869 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8436870 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8436871 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8436872 it is really hard to get your head around the fact that when your child goes on an excursion they need to have a permission slip signed by the parent but the school is within its rights to take a child to the doctor to be put on the pill
8436873 i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the further conduct of the roll call vote all votes cast by the delegates will be counted and that i move that sen barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8436874 you know i am sorry if anyone was offended it was certainly not meant in any way to be offensive
8436875 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked him obama personally
8436876 you could say that no ones ever really prepared to be president
8436877 but if he knew how to make it bad then he knows how to make it right again and he needs to do that tonight
8436878 the major thrust of his message has to be to show that the party is really united
8436879 weve always been very impressed with him and i just wish he would continue to be an elder statesman like a younger jimmy carter
8436880 as part of that tradition i am here today to release you as my delegates
8436881 many other people who sign their ballots will make a different choice
8436882 you are to be given the respect and recognition you have earned as delegates for the democratic party
8436883 i remember going through each and every one of those primaries thinking this one is going to push her over no its not this one is going to push her over no its not and so i think it was a continual process of being excited and anxious and let down excited anxious and letdown
8436884 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8436885 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8436886 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8436887 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8436888 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8436889 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8436890 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8436925 we havent made an analysis yet it is better for me to answer after that

8436986 there is no strong evidence yet for specific gene variants alleles gt that lead to group differences differences between clusters in gt behavior or intelligence but progress on the genomic side of this gt question will be rapid in coming years as the price to sequence a gt genome is dropping at an exponential rate
8436987 what seems to be true from preliminary studies is that the gene variants that were under strong selection reached fixation over the last 10k years are different in different clusters that is the way that modern people in each cluster differ due to natural selection from their own ancestors 10k years ago is not the same in each cluster we have been at least at the genetic level experiencing divergent evolution

8437027 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8437028 a lot of the women who dropped off the list this year were for job related reasons
8437029 in some cases its simply a matter of the woman still has a powerful position but other women are relatively more powerful and pushed her down and off the list
8437030 certainly had she been the democratic nominee that probably would have catapulted her higher
8437031 shes still an incredibly powerful force shes way more powerful than any other female senator

8437033 men are more inclined than women to exhibit a range of risk taking behaviours while on the road
8437034 men are more inclined to speed show aggression fall asleep behind the wheel and to identify themselves as impatient
8437035 insurance premiums usually take gender into account for these very reasons
8437036 men are more likely to be involved in an accident due to overconfident or risky driving and women are more likely to have had difficulty judging distances but are generally more courteous on the road
8437037 yes i am accepting students i look forward to seeing your application
8437038 the point you made about so and so was interesting i was thinking about how it might be applied to such and such
8437039 overall this report shows that new zealand s social wellbeing has made great strides in the past few years
8437040 some days i walk down the street and go god i was in that expletive band unbelievable it is
8437041 why is this needed in the current work and architecture
8437042 we have a number of new songs we are working on and our goal is to record in the spring for a summer 2009 release we are very excited about this new material
8437043 we finished up recording and mixing this album back in july 2007 then we started shopping it to labels in the middle of this our guitarist left who we replaced with jim before getting picked up by anticulture in late 2007 early 2008 and they set a may release date during this time the artwork that we had for the cd was bought by sony bmg rendering it useless to us so we had to get the artwork re done by marcelo hvc this delay gave us the chance to remaster the album at the label s request and remove some samples that we were struggling to get clearance for but lo and behold when we went back the studio had deleted the audio luckily andy giblin had the rhythm guitars and drums saved in his personal archive so we re recorded the bass vocals and solos in june of this year remixed the album and remastered it
8437044 my daughter was at home and called me she sounded frantic
8437045 i rushed home and found that a landslip had demolished our side wall fence
8437046 they are building luxurious condominiums next to our house i believe it was their construction work that caused the landslip
8437047 i complained many times to the damansara heights residents association which then sent the complaint to dbkl but nothing was done
8437048 the authorities told me that there was nothing to worry about as they would evaluate the situation
8437049 we were notified by the election commission this yesterday morning and weve got in touch with him
8437050 he has 60 days to take the oath it can be done anytime not necessarily in the house it can be done in my office too
8437051 the result for the permatang pauh by election is already out and the decision favours datuk seri anwar ibrahim so he will be sworn in tomorrow today
8437052 i expect him to control his members better if the deputy prime minister of the day can smile when he is hammered by the opposition i dont see why the opposition mps cant do the same when attacked by backbenchers
8437053 politics is a game what is today is different tomorrow they may try they may not
8437054 it was just studying and studying because the emphasis for me was on getting as in exams
8437055 i could not talk confidently to people especially my teachers it was difficult to make new friends and i used to stammer
8437056 i was forced to find my own footing with the help of my coursemates as i was on my own without the comfort of my family and familiar surroundings
8437057 i advise all students to get a life during their schooldays studies are not everything
8437058 one needs to develop talent and character to show the world how useful one can be
8437059 why didnt all of them support him does this show weaknesses in the party itself
8437060 many of the permatang pauh people including the fence sitters of whom a majority are malays cannot accept such an approach and this resulted in them showing sympathy for anwar
8437061 i think people get whats going on lets see how this thing gets a happy ending
8437062 id rather break the law than live with injustice my whole life
8437063 yang jias abnormal behavior is a measure of abnormality in our own society
8437064 some raised the issue of why he did it so this got into bigger issue of maybe there were injustices carried out by the shanghai police
8437065 thats where i think authorities would not want this case to go
8437066 yesterday i wrote one about why the shanghai court didnt put the notice of the trials schedule on its web site which the law says they should do three days in advance
8437067 we started receiving distress calls at 3pm from the public about flash floods and rushed our response teams to the affected areas

8437070 repacked medication is also exposed to pollution and bacteria which may decrease their effectiveness and quality
8437071 the sultan seems to be very pleased with what he was told about the development corridors progress and had indicated strong possibilities of brunei investing there
8437072 another team from the group came here earlier and their initial assessments of iskandar malaysia was part of the reason why the sultan had chosen to come here to have a personal look at the progress of the development corridor
8437073 the rest of the team was already warming up for the decisive seventh game but few of the 12 884 fans had any inkling that duckworth who already had missed the last three weeks of portlands magical 1990 season was going to play when the fans saw duckworth they just exploded with a standing ovation that lasted a full two minutes
8437074 changs window was down so i reached in to grab his keys and open the car door

8437079 i can play on this level i got some game
8437080 can yall just give me one moment to use the port o let
8437081 quando estamos em uma posi o favor vel precisamos pontuar com os dois carros
8437082 let me tell you its getting interesting fisher said after thursday mornings practice the first of the day as the seminoles went twice for the first time
8437083 we see how the scrimmages go i dont have a crystal ball but its not letting up and theyre not making it easy i promise you that
8437084 when you can handle the blitz the game becomes fun at quarterback he said
8437085 once you realize the blitz in an opportunity for a big play instead of an opportunity for disaster the game becomes fun
8437086 he can beat you with his legs he can beat you with his arm and now what he is learning to do is to beat you with his mind
8437087 everybody makes it a two horse race i think its a three horse race
8437088 well do our best to get there when the season ends
8437089 it should be motivation i dont think the players will like it but it doesnt mean a darn thing right now
8437090 you see the shake and bake and you see the effort he is really trying to be that leader you want him to be in a group of great talent
8437091 i was just hoping it was a bruise or a pulled muscle or something
8437092 but its kind of hard when its in your knee to know exactly what is hurting
8437093 well just have to see how rehab goes and what they find inside the knee
8437094 you dont want to win a spot like this due to an injury
8437095 but at the same time it says carpe diem on our shirts youve got to seize the day
8437096 i think this time of the year i think all of em probably get a little sore
8437097 he probably had a little bit more throwing so much as much as we throw i think its kind of common
8437098 i dont know anything about that hopefully ill be here you never know
8437099 when hes not getting the sexual contact he wants he turns absolutely violent
8437100 this is a frightening type of thing to have happen to someone who trusted someone they met on the internet and ended up absolutely helpless in that persons apartment and helpless because of what that person provided them to ingest
8437101 if something has happened to you let us know were going to look into it and hopefully stop it from happening to someone else
8437102 we dont need to be playing these games obviously you see in the league that guys are getting hurt you dont need to play obviously with us having a long season last year going to the super bowl playing more games in the preseason and having a risk of injuries is not smart
8437103 since ive been playing i dont think half of us have played that last preseason game
8437104 a lot is said about how preseason doesnt necessarily count but in a sense it does
8437105 not in the matter of wins or losses but in the matter of preparation and its our last game to get preparation its big for us and its another opportunity to gain some consistency within the offensive unit
8437106 what you would like to do is have a chance to play a lot of young guys and let them play and put them in situations and let them fend for themselves
8437107 but obviously when the game is over you want them all standing tall and ready to go the next week too
8437108 theyre just coming in to finish off their preseason and we are going out to do the same
8437109 we are going out to win that is the only difference
8437110 only one parent is allowed to go to the gate with a security pass to pick up an unaccompanied minor
8437111 when i got there they were closing the gate like everyone had been let off the plane and jenna was not there
8437112 two passengers from that flight both mothers told me they had seen a little girl get off the plane by herself and follow the crowd to the shuttle tram
8437113 the ground crew said you might want to check the bathrooms and i was like me my child was put under your responsibility and i should check the bathrooms it was unbelievable
8437114 we have a well established process for unaccompanied minors and it wasnt followed
8437115 we are so sorry and sincerely apologize to the family
8437116 the crew showed no concern they were oblivious to the fact that they had lost a child and i saw very little action in front of my eyes that they took any urgency to rectify the situation it was pure luck that this man wasnt someone who wanted to take advantage of a helpless 10 year old girl
8437117 you know when i think back now i realize that if they cant keep track of a dog i should have never trusted them with my daughter
8437118 we havent had a chance to talk to mrs boyer about her daughter yet
8437119 but we want to take her and her family on a field trip to dulles to walk through our process and see how it should work and see if they have any ideas on how to improve it
8437120 we can continue to resolve the matter amicably however long that may take
8437121 on what is appropriate for the events as they unfolded
8437122 we simply dont agree with the penalty and want to talk about it further
8437123 i like the group that is one thing i like about this football team is we have good senior leadership the unity council has stepped into the forefront they have taken great ownership into the program
8437124 we practiced well i thought we have had two good days of practice but once again we still have some mistakes we need to get corrected they are starting to understand the game plan and what we are doing i thought it was pretty good on both sides of the football i like what i am seeing right now
8437125 they have a number of skill guys they have some good receivers their quarterback is a good player they have some guys if you put the ball in their hands they can cause you problems it is going to be a heck of a test for us
8437126 acabou dando ensejo conforma o e consolida o de estados de inconstitucionalidade
8437127 he spun me out so i just you know got into him a little bit and let him know that i didnt appreciate the way he passed me and he retaliated and ended up spinning me out so couldnt tell you
8437128 my take from being out here a couple of days is that were really ready to go from how we greet people at the airport to how we deal with security issues
8437129 but the protesters were not worried about its the people who are there to throw a brick through a window or throw things at police officers were also prepared for them
8437130 boden is one of the most successful and fastest growing online clothing companies in the uk from our humble beginnings 16 years ago weve blossomed into an international clothing giant and are widely recognised as a leader in online fashion
8437131 a nation where you are not judged on the language you speak but the words spoken not by the color of your skin but the content of your character a nation where a 6 year old like barack like manuel can have access to opportunity the audacity of hope the reality of the dream a nation where future generations will be able to proclaim that we left them a world better than we received
8437132 last night she set the stage and tonight she finished it
8437133 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8437134 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8437135 i think she accomplished what she needed to accomplish which was to tell her loyal followers to get on board to remember that theyre a democrat and to vote democratic
8437136 i think she couldve been a little more supportive of obama
8437137 like could have said im sorry i said those things like he wouldnt make a good commander in chief i think she shouldve thrown that in
8437138 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8437139 now let me tell you if you think youve seen dramatic changes in the world in technology in the last ten years you aint seen nothing yet
8437140 unlike senator clinton i have no kind of ambiguity about my candidate
8437141 she said her candidate is unprepared to be president i announced when i was running that if i wasnt running i would support john mccain so im very enthusiastic
8437142 if the president isnt exactly on our side call the first lady and with michelle obama we are going to have somebody who answers that phone
8437143 she has broke so many stereotypes changed the perception forever gotten rid of the notion that no longer a woman could be president that is over those days are gone
8437144 i want to say this up front i honor john mccains service to our country he served in uniform with honor and distinction and he deserves we owe him gratitude for that but we dont owe him our vote because the stakes are too high
8437145 as you are undoubtedly aware ernest jones is one of the uks largest retailers of fine jewellery diamonds watches and gifts with over 200 high street locations throughout the country ernest jones stocks some of the worlds most prestigious and sought after luxury watch brands such as tag heuer gucci emporio armani rado omega dreyfuss amp co and longines to name just a few
8437146 these contracts were meant to protect u s soldiers serving their country and we will not tolerate corruption that deprives the troops of the benefits of competitively sourced goods and services
8437147 we are the veterans the iraq war veterans the anti war veterans
8437148 i just cant imagine driving through my neighborhood at home and seeing a security checkpoint
8437149 dear patrons we are sorry for the delay of the train today
8437150 we believe the money we were paid by texland was earned for years of hard but ultimately successful efforts on behalf of texland efforts that also benefited pec
8437151 following this payment we never received another payment from this account or from texland
8437152 the board members all assert that they were not informed
8437153 i was not aware that texland was an active entity and certainly not aware there was a non interest bearing bank account in texlands name to find out payments were actually made from this account without board knowledge and approval is extremely disheartening
8437154 there were other transactions prior to that date but we have not yet gotten the details
8437155 our mission is going to be to investigate all expenditures and all records for texland going back to the 1980s
8437156 this one disclosure certainly will be examined but there are i believe many other issues that need to be investigated
8437157 the matter now is entirely in the hands of the attorney generals office
8437158 this revelation is a continuing pattern of how fuelberg and burnett lined their own pockets by fleecing the pec membership
8437159 once the texland bank account was made known to the members fuelberg and burnett knew it was only a matter of time before this information was uncovered
8437160 i just think that the public has been left out of this process
8437161 any meetings at which the adoption of any proposed policy position resolution rule regulation or formal action occurs shall be held only after full and timely notice to the public
8437162 we hold that the notice of the january 8th meeting was full because an ordinary member of the community would understand that the agenda item listed on the notice mill site committee update would include consideration of and possible formal action on the mill site park proposal
8437163 in addition we hold that because the notice contained the agenda information available at the time of posting it satisfied the requirement that specific agenda information be included in the notice where possible
8437164 everyone could go along as if its still valid and take the risk that some court some day is going to say its not valid
8437165 the smarter thing to do would be after the city has this brought to their attention to give a proper notice and redo it the vote
8437166 this case just illustrates the dangers of drinking and driving
8437167 especially with the labor day weekend coming up we want the public to be aware when you choose to get behind the wheel when youre intoxicated youre putting your and other peoples lives in jeopardy
8437168 the folks at centerpoint determined there is no immediate public danger unless youre right there at the leak site
8437169 we have followed closely the progress this district has made over the years
8437170 you have managed a lot of hard issues related to finance and growth
8437171 obamas challenge americas economic crisis and the power of a transformative presidency
8437172 sometimes obama has a gift of intuitively knowing how to talk about what ails americans and sometimes he just goes hope y and i think hes got to do both things
8437173 in every single case what needed to be done was more radical than the conventional wisdom
8437174 i believe in luck otherwise how do i account for my enemys success
8437175 but being a french citizen means you re not categorized as african french or southeast asian french or west indian french you re just plain french that s the republican ideal citizenship bestowing theoretical equality belying the reality of racism french schoolchildren are steeped in the concept of a single france the law actually forbids taking a census according to ethnic or racial categories

8437177 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8437178 theres a strong chance that by friday we could see some fairly significant pump price increases
8437179 crude can be replaced and brought in via tanker but bringing a damaged refinery back up again can take a long time as we saw with katrina and rita

8437194 these professional grade poker size playing cards take a peek into the dark corners of the grand ole party featuring a plethora of politicians who got caught playing pitcher for the wrong team allegedly
8437195 she was someone who defined love devotion and constancy she defined from my perspective what marriage is supposed to be about
8437196 we decided to put a human face on the issue
8437197 entirely a web site business there were not many newspapers there
8437198 im a competitor and i get the sense this marketplace doesnt compete
8437199 everyone is hanging on for dear life at both papers i think probably the days of high stakes competition in chicago are over
8437200 to see what has happened in this business i dont want to go down with it
8437201 henry kissinger and others were involved in the deliberate development of infective microorganism for the purpose of genocide in central africa and other parts of the world

8437242 that best serves the need of the new mexico racing industry
8437243 i just dont want to be known as a new business that could possibly hurt children
8437244 it defies logic that georgia got some kind of glaspie like
8437245 evidence and written submissions have been requested from each rider and a three member panel of the fei tribunal has been appointed
8437246 the panel will then in light of all the evidence received take a decision as to the applicable sanction if any

8437248 its the latest fad and will die out after its 15 minutes of fame
8437249 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8437250 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8437251 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8437252 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8437253 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8437254 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8437255 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8437256 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8437257 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8437258 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8437259 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8437260 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8437261 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8437262 even though hes scheduled to pitch friday we are evaluating on a day to day basis
8437263 the key is not to let guys play when theyre in a vulnerable state
8437264 no compromise with the main purpose no peace till victory no pact with unrepentant wrong
8437265 death in the air that really gets the boys pens moving
8437266 yo oh vinny yo oh antny yo oh stosh hey missus desilvio can antny and antny come out to play

8437269 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8437270 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since
8437271 in america and across the globe has convinced me that gets it
8437272 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change
8437273 declare together in one voice right now that is our candidate and he will our president
8437274 a candidate who once campaigned on the promise of a campaign of ideas not insults now has nothing left but personal attacks
8437275 will end this politics of distortion and division he will be a president who seeks not to perfect the lies of swift boating but to end them once and for all
8437276 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time
8437277 we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they try but today that american dream feels as if its slowly slipping away
8437278 less secure and more isolated than at any time in our recent history
8437279 the resurgence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front against terrorism
8437280 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8437281 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because is on the right side of history
8437282 she never quit on the people she stood up for
8437283 he drove home the point that the clintons are 100 percent behind for president
8437284 before this just went to a landfill and would lay there and rot and create methane seepage

8437296 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8437297 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8437298 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8437299 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8437300 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones

8437306 i think its important it go down in history her coming as close as she did to winning the nomination
8437307 thats my role in the party its my conviction about the importance of political engagement
8437308 this is not about clinton its not about obama its about the nation the nation is due for a change
8437309 you dont win elections by showing up at these breakfasts you win elections by knocking on doors
8437310 florida is a state that decides elections and lately youve been doing a damn poor job

8437312 john mccain is not a perfect man he can be a little emotional but he is fundamentally a good person i would feel comfortable waking up in the morning with john mccain as president
8437313 if you believe what we need is another four years then vote john mccain if you believe we need to take a different track barack obama will start the process of restoring america
8437314 young voters are motivated like never before young voters are working hard for the voice of a new generation barack obama
8437315 ill be a democrat at the end of the day but if you were sent here by your constituents and you are a person with integrity you stick with how you were sent
8437316 she wanted to be a hillary delegate excuse me where is your ethics am i wrong
8437317 she should have kept her mouth shut or she should step down
8437318 it seemed she was being pushed out of the race
8437319 and when they pushed her they were pushing us because we worked for her
8437320 vote for whoever you want to vote for but remember this never took place because if they hear that were divisive you do nothing but demean the democratic party and put john mccain in office
8437321 what was proposed was that in our low season or down time that we could out of compassion help out some of the sailboats but the houseboats no we are not built and cannot handle houseboats
8437322 what was addressed was the sailboats the way our moorage is built and our breakwaters are done we cant handle houseboats
8437323 theyre partying and bringing friends that we dont know and causing a lot of problems in the marina
8437324 when we launched u pass last year ubc o students asked for transit service between vernon and kelowna
8437325 we are pleased the vernon regional transit system is putting the service on the road and were sure that students as well as commuters and shoppers will see the benefits of transit for themselves

8437327 what was proposed was that in our low season or down time that we could out of compassion help out some of the sailboats but the houseboats no we are not built and cannot handle houseboats
8437328 what was addressed was the sailboats the way our moorage is built and our breakwaters are done we cant handle houseboats
8437329 theyre partying and bringing friends that we dont know and causing a lot of problems in the marina
8437330 in the course of making this decision i thought long and hard about what i brought and what i did not bring to the mayors office i took into consideration my family the many people that have supported me those that have encouraged me and those that asked me to continue to represent the citizens of this community
8437331 as i consider the positives regarding a second term as mayor i find 28 000 reasons to continue that being said when i consider my family i find many reasons to return to nursing
8437332 given that the position of councillor would allow me to continue to represent people on the westside apply the knowledge that i have gained over the past year and at the same time allow me to return to a part time position at kgh i feel that this would be the best way to balance the needs of my family and those of the 28 000 people on the westside
8437333 martin l king would not have been successful without lbj
8437334 when you control someone source of information you control this persons entire life
8437335 one can only relate to me or you because of his her experiences education intelligence and most of all his her uci
8437336 you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink
8437337 the sad reality is that the common person takes my words personally and textually and totally misses the entire truth by alienating themselves to the messages i am trying to convey
8437338 we all need to distance ourselves from our self to help another
8437339 every american who was trying to do the right thing
8437340 john mccain is my friend weve traveled the world together its a friendship that goes beyond politics and the personal courage and heroism demonstrated by john still amazes me
8437341 but i profoundly i profoundly disagree with the direction john wants to take this country from afghanistan to iraq from amtrak to veterans
8437342 barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8437343 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore american leadership in the world
8437344 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8437345 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8437346 this confirms that there is west nile virus activity locally and it is a reminder that we should take steps to avoid mosquito bites
8437347 thousands of police will be deployed to move the protesters out of the government house
8437348 if the police want to arrest them come here and do so or if they want our leaders to give themselves up that is fine but the government has to resign first
8437349 if we leave before this government resigns that means we are defeated
8437350 save jersey is quickly becoming one of new jerseys premier blogs
8437351 the alaska election results show that citizens reject taxpayer funded campaign programs new jerseys citizens were given the same opportunity to vote on this states own clean elections experiment they too would defeat it citizens understand that forcing taxpayers to finance the campaigns of politicians does nothing to produce clean government
8437352 especially remarkable about alaskans rejection of taxpayer funded campaigns is that one of their sitting if any set of voters is attuned to public corruption problems its alaskans but they still rejected the ballot measure because they know that sending more public dollars to politicians cannot cure corruption driven by the attraction of public money in the first place massachusetts where they repealed the publicly funded campaign program in 2003 because it wasted taxpayer money and failed to achieve its purposes
8437353 new jersey legislators working to make citizens pay for political campaigns should take note of the lessons of
8437354 i swear to you on my love for slipknot this is not a joke its the 100 truth
8437355 they shouldt change they should make another iowa im sure the next album will sound like the old ones
8437356 every album we have made is a statement about that space in time i think this era is the most mature most beautiful and the most powerful we have made an album that will show the road behind the road ahead and where we are as men i think its the best thing ive ever made and i challenge anyone to prove me wrong
8437357 when we were starting out we had all these strikes against us
8437358 we were from iowa there were nine of us we wore masks we wore coveralls we played metal hard metal
8437359 it was tough getting people to come out to des moines
8437360 i dont know why its a pretty cool place but a amp r dudes jaded folks from los angeles or new york its hard to get them to come to iowa
8437361 we also took a lot of shit from other bands
8437362 when we hit the road with ozzfest in 1999 i heard a lot of condescending remarks from other musicians they were saying
8437363 our music stood up were much more popular now and it wasnt because of our image it was the music
8437364 its our fourth album and we wanted to do something different
8437365 you cant put out the same record over and over again at the same time you can definitely still tell that this is slipknot
8437366 im looking forward to the expressions on peoples faces when they hear the new record
8437367 theres very very heavy stuff on this album and its gonna blow peoples minds but im also excited for them to see the stuff thats different on this album the more experimental music no ones going to expect it
8437368 i think everyone just went in with an open mind we would always listen to everyones ideas and if they worked they worked if they didnt they didnt
8437369 this time we really tried to build off the ideas really tried to work on them i think it helped that so many of us were able to spend time doing our own thing too just writing with different people really makes a difference in how you think about music when we finally came together we were able to bring that to the mix
8437370 it gave us more time and energy to experiment in the studio i was able to come up with more guitar sounds than ever
8437371 our shows were like sporting events wed put everything into them and then afterwards wed be fucking exhausted we werent going to pile into a van all nine of us and then drive all night to the next show wed have fallen asleep at the wheel and died
8437372 those early shows were rough but i loved the small stage
8437373 there was something intimate about it it was like an old school punk show which is what i grew up with
8437374 it was 8 000 degrees youre bumping into people youre tripping over equipment those small stages have low ceilings so the heats trapped real low right at your head those shows are about survival not about playing
8437375 shawn used to bring chop saws on stage to grind pipes for sparks
8437376 once a chunk broke off and sent a kid to the hospital but people who got hurt at our shows were cool about it wed follow them to the hospital and sign some shirts and shit it was like you know no harm no foul
8437377 wed be on tour and fire marshals would show up with camcorders and accuse us of all kinds of crazy bullshit theyd say we heard you set yourselves on fire
8437378 sid and clown would spray each other with lighter fluid and then theyd pull out lighters that got us in trouble one promoter would call the next theyd warn each other and theyd hit us with do not lists we were castrated
8437379 sometimes we hate each other sometimes we hate the world sometimes we just hate our own lives but when we get together something monstrous happens and we pull this amazing sound out of all that energy
8437380 we believe in world domination and this is the band thats gonna get us there
8437381 you know we went from being some local band in a basement to selling millions of records
8437382 its going to be a decade since the first album came out im so happy and amazed and proud and thankful for where this band has gone ive gotten to see the world and i get paid for it id have done it for free
8437383 i think the best part about being in this band has been getting exposure to the rest of the world you realize that everything in the world is the same people feel the same they have the same desires hopes fears being worldly is a gift that i dont ever want to give back it changes your life especially when youre from a small town in iowa
8437384 i always knew wed go far i just knew it
8437385 there was no way this band was going to fail but i never knew wed reach the heights weve come to weve traveled the world so many times all the different countries are like our second homes to this day it still blows me away that we took this crazy idea and made it a global sensation
8437386 every album we have made is a statement about that space in time i think this era is the most mature most beautiful and the most powerful we have made an album that will show the road behind the road ahead and where we are as men i think its the best thing ive ever made and i challenge anyone to prove me wrong
8437387 saddam neglected basra too after 1991 how ironic and sad thanks dad for the forward iraqis must be aware of what this government has and has not done

8437393 there was a cctv system at the property which has been recovered by officers and will be examined over the coming days

8437395 a search will be carried out of the property to establish if anybody was inside as soon as the building is deemed to be safe
8437396 if someone kills another person science can bring knowledge as to how the murder took place but it doesnt answer why there was a murder

8437519 the grace of our lord jesus christ the love of god the father and the fellowship of the holy spirit be with you all forever
8437520 how does the fact of the trinity assist us in our daily walk with god
8437521 there are three that bear witness the father the word and the holy spirit and these three are one
8437522 in that day you will ask in my name and i do not say to you that i shall pray the father for you for the father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that i came forth from god
8437523 if any man thirst let him come to me and drink

8437531 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8437532 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8437533 no desire to overthrow the system and a change in public worldview is sought only in connection with one perceived flaw in that system

8437535 but i am very excited about the new 7th army structure which will continue to provide expeditionary capabilities for the u s european command this event underscores that transformation in europe is proceeding as planned
8437536 there s a lot of real property to be turned over to the government military property to be moved it s really just a contingency plan
8437537 you can get to the point where you have so many outposts that you spend more time securing yourself than the area
8437538 some of these might be in areas that used to be important places and some might be more effective elsewhere they re looking at all of that to see where we should be
8437539 but for something like this fob that s a little bigger than the brigade
8437540 we d need additional assets to come in from other locations and if you re talking about closing down other outposts at the same time it becomes even more complex
8437541 if we were tasked with just that and given the resources we need it certainly could happen quickly
8437542 but whether that means closing this and the outposts at the same time or if there are still other missions to do that all has to be a high level decision before we begin
8437543 nadie os prive de vuestro premio afectando humildad y culto a los ngeles entremeti ndose en lo que no ha visto vanamente hinchado por su propia mente carnal
8437544 as que no dejen que nadie los condene y menos esa gente que adora a los ngeles y que aparenta ser humilde dicen que ven visiones pero mienten sus pensamientos los llenan de orgullo pero s lo piensan cosas malas
8437545 yo juan soy el que oy y vio estas cosas y despu s que las hube o do y visto me postr para adorar a los pies del ngel que me mostraba estas cosas pero l me dijo mira no lo hagas porque yo soy consiervo tuyo de tus hermanos los profetas y de los que guardan las palabras de este libro adora a dios

8437549 porque los ngeles son solamente esp ritus que sirven a dios y l los env a para ayudar a toda la gente que dios habr de salvar
8437550 es evidente que los ngeles no son sino esp ritus enviados por dios con la misi n de ayudar a los que han de recibir la salvaci n como una herencia
8437551 es que no son todos ellos esp ritus servidores con la misi n de asistir a los que han de heredar la salvaci n

8437557 after a while viper became an icon of its own
8437558 then it has to justify itself on a product and marketing basis
8437559 viper has a small loyal buyer base but like its motown brethren chrysler appears incapable of supporting a niche product
8437560 its another sign that theyre becoming more of a marketer

8437567 dark matter makes up five times more matter in the universe than ordinary matter
8437568 this study confirms that we are dealing with a very different kind of matter unlike anything that we are made of and were able to study it in a very powerful collision of two clusters of galaxies
8437569 the survey reveals there are some big unheard messages this kind of data helps us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their programme planning efforts
8437570 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programmes to encourage and support behaviour change
8437571 the association between magnesium sulfate and a lower incidence of cerebral palsy has biologic plausibility because magnesium stabilizes blood vessels protects against damage from oxygen depletion and protects against injury from swelling and inflammation all of which threaten the vulnerable preterm brain
8437572 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to evaluate the effect of magnesium sulfate on the incidence of cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8437573 our finding that magnesium sulfate protects against cerebral palsy is consistent with two previous randomized trials both of which were well done and which in total enrolled over 1 600 women our trial and the two others show that magnesium sulfate can reduce the risk of this devastating condition in preterm infants until we can prevent early preterm birth the best that we obstetricians can do is to improve the prospects for infants who are born very early i think that our study says that magnesium sulfate can help us do that
8437574 the use of these levels as risk markers may help clinicians to assess their patients more fully and thus to prevent premature deaths in patients who have high risk
8437575 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8437576 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
8437577 dr evans is truly a pioneer in the field of pediatric oncology and in patient care

8437579 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8437580 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8437581 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8437582 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8437583 we dont know how many people have this pms2 variant
8437584 we would like to take these findings to human tumor samples if we could find out which individuals carry this variant it might change our decisions about treating them with cisplatin
8437585 this represents a major step forward in our understanding of the dry form of macular degeneration
8437586 and with the identification of this potential target we can try to develop treatments for a disease which for the moment we cant treat
8437587 this raises particular concerns regarding rnai therapy for wet amd
8437588 but by establishing this link between the treatment for the wet form of amd and the potential harmful effect on the dry form of the disease we can perhaps better understand the mechanisms of both diseases
8437589 i think these results have to be taken with caution because the association effect of tlr3 with amd is very small when compared to the diseases association with some other genes
8437590 and there has been already one study saying there is absolutely no association of the tlr3 genetic variant with amd so this raises a question and a need for further edification it could be that this is just a spurious finding and there is in fact no association with amd
8437591 the senate is currently conducting an internal investigation in an attempt to discover who is behind this once we learn their identity that information will be turned over to law enforcement and we would expect it to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
8437592 jen hodson who came eighth in the canoeing final is quoted as saying how emotional and unsettled she was
8437593 you are on the line shaking like a leaf and you dont know why there are so many emotions perhaps because it is the end of a four year cycle and it is not just a stepping stone anymore and it all creates different pressures
8437594 i think my performance was important to the team because we needed something to boost everyones confidence
8437595 this to me is an athlete who was crying out for some kind of mental preparation she is no doubt not the only one
8437596 the important thing is not to win but to take part
8437597 we clearly have to change the profile of our winners in terms of demographics
8437598 trolling the internet using data mining techniques and simply buying lists to create a directory are actions that clearly violate a consumers right to privacy
8437599 verizon wireless has long refused to release our customers numbers and we call on legislators and policy makers to ensure that what a consumer wants to be private stays that way
8437600 we are leveraging our service delivery ecosystem with brew and bringing it to the widget delivery platform

8437640 dit standard verdiende gewoon om in de champions league te zitten
8437641 we hebben twee perfecte matchen gespeeld we spelen zelfs de perfecte verlengingen tot dat ene gaatje en de bal gaat er dan nog in ook dit standard was minstens de evenknie van liverpool over de twee matchen bekeken hadden wij zelfs de beste kansen dat liverpool niet in zijn spel kwam was ook onze verdienste deze prestatie is ook een waarschuwing voor de andere belgische teams als we op dit elan doorgaan kan niemand ons volgen
8437642 alle respect voor liverpool maar het is niet het beste team dat gewonnen heeft
8437643 we hebben goed gespeeld onze organisatie was perfect ik ben fier op mijn team we hebben hier heel wat kansen gehad en in de heenwedstrijd misten we al een penalty e n foutje kost ons de kwalificatie als je er zo dicht bij was kun je niet anders dan ontgoocheld zijn de arbitrage floot in het voordeel van liverpool maar dat is nu niet belangrijk ik wens liverpool het allerbeste in het vervolg van de competitie
8437644 we wisten dat het een heel moeilijke wedstrijd zou worden
8437645 net als in de heenwedstrijd heeft standard goed gespeeld ze hebben ons hard doen werken wij hebben de wedstrijd wel gecontroleerd maar tot echte kansen kwamen we niet gelukkig maakte kuyt het in de slotfase dan toch af
8437646 you have heard that it was said of those of old you shall not commit adultery but i say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart if your right eye causes you to sin pluck it out and cast it for you for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to be cast into hell and if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and cast it from you for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to be cast into hell

8437649 for if you live according to the flesh you will die but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live

8437674 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8437675 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8437676 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8437677 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8437678 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8437749 studies show that sports drinks are better than water at re hydrating kids because sports drinks contain essential electrolytes and because kids are more likely to drink the required liquids if there is a moderate amount of sodium and some fruit flavor included
8437750 other sports drinks are not designed for kids needs and have too much sodium and other undesirable ingredients for kids

8437769 this was another solid financial quarter for tivo as we continued to improve our financial profile by posting substantially better than guided adjusted ebitda of 10 6 million and net income of 2 9 million
8437770 during the quarter we made significant progress in several key areas of our business in terms of our mass distribution strategy comcast has reaffirmed its long term support for our partnership as evidenced by its roll out in connecticut our international footprint continues to grow with sevens successful introduction of tivo to the australian market and on the standalone side of the business with the recent addition of youtube content delivered right to the tv set our vision of creating the ultimate television dream machine is coming to fruition as subscribers now have access to the broadest array of content options and features in the world delivering consumers what they want when they want it
8437771 we are pleased with the progress of the tivo service and have broadened its footprint in our new england market to connecticut refinements to optimize the products performance have been mostly completed significantly improving the user experience importantly we intend to light up a full marketing campaign around tivo in september and upon this occurring we will be announcing multiple additional markets to which tivo will be rolled out through next year we will also continue to fund development work for the tivo product which will include expanding the feature set and adding support for tru2way infrastructure
8437772 additionally the tivo service on cox which is currently in trials is on track for a launch in coxs new england market later this year
8437773 on the international front seven and tivo successfully launched the tivo service in australia and because of the significant consumer demand there retailers chose to release the product early we are also extremely pleased with the marketing shoulder seven is putting behind this launch as theyve prominently featured tivo in their marketing and programming including the olympic opening ceremonies their top rated morning show and a special advertising spot they developed which includes dozens of australian celebrities international distribution is an increasingly important component of our business model and there continues to be tremendous interest from international distributors for the tivo offering
8437774 in terms of our litigation with echostar and defending our intellectual property we are now in the enforcement phase of the process on september 4 2008 there is a contempt hearing scheduled to determine whether echostar is in contempt of the injunction that has already been upheld by the u s court of appeals for the federal circuit enjoining them from selling and operating infringing units as well as to determine further damages from echostars continued infringement after september 2006 we remain confident in the outcome and look forward to final resolution in the near future and to realizing the value of our intellectual property
8437775 on the tivo owned side of the business our goal of making our standalone product a comprehensive video solution one box one remote one user interface and a one stop shop for all content from all sources is becoming a reality we are continually adding more content choices to our offering and recently announced the availability of youtube tivo can now provide access to more television and broadband content choices than any other offering in the world with thousands of movies and televisions shows and millions of songs and videos available at any time
8437776 our continued efforts to focus on efficient marketing spend and to work with third parties who make their own marketing expenditures on behalf of tivo is underscored by the decline of our quarterly subscription acquisition costs sac to 135 a considerable decrease when compared to sac of 758 during the same period last year even considering that the prior years sac included the impact of the 11 2 million inventory reserve we are driving tivo sales through relationships with leading retailers and consumer electronic manufacturers that will also market the product for example we are currently working with many best buy stores in six of its larger markets where tivo is being made available as part of a special bundled offer as the recommended cable set top box of choice to be purchased with hd televisions also in these markets best buy is creating a tivo branded living room environment making the television entertainment experience as compelling as possible these efforts along with others will enable us to build on our standalone business while we also manage subscription acquisition costs and overall marketing expenditures
8437777 another key example of our partnering with third parties to use their marketing resources to drive tivo is the announcement we made today with the leading consumer entertainment industry magazine entertainment weekly we are teaming up with entertainment weekly to deliver and jointly market its what to watch tv picks directly to the television while tivo automatically records the recommended shows this ensures that broadband enabled tivo users always have these top picks available to watch whenever they tune in this partnership allows two powerful brands to work together to create a seamless television viewing experience underscoring tivos goal of providing easy solutions that bring together television viewing with an individuals lifestyle we are encouraged by the number of media companies that continue to express real interest in using tivos technology to help bring innovation to their existing business models and view these relationships as an opportunity to drive incremental subscriptions in an efficient manner tivo owned subscription gross additions for the second quarter were approximately 36 000 compared to 41 000 gross additions for the year ago period the tivo owned monthly churn rate was 1 5 up from 1 3 in the prior quarter and equivalent to the rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 overall tivo owned subscriptions ended the quarter at approximately 1 7 million as expected tivo reported a net decline in msos broadcaster subscriptions during the period as directv is no longer deploying new tivo boxes and other mass distribution deals are still in the early phases of deployment cumulative total subscriptions as of july 31 2008 were 3 6 million
8437778 we are also making solid progress in our advertising business tivo has created a number of ad solutions that are aimed at overcoming the enormous challenge facing the television industry as dvr based consumer control becomes even more pervasive we continue to build strong relationships with many television advertisers advertising agencies television networks and cable operators and are working with all of them to solve the issues that come with commercial avoidance the progress we have made is clear when compared to last years second quarter approximately 50 percent more advertisers utilized tivo in the second quarter of this year this is an indication that tivo will play a meaningful role in the future of television advertising
8437779 more specifically we continue to prove that our ad solutions are some of the most unique and innovative available to marketers we recently announced a deal with amazon that provides tivo users with the ability to purchase products from amazon com directly from their tv sets enabling advertisers to strategically promote merchandise on any network or program the new product purchase offering garnered significant media attention largely due to the fact that the new interactive advertising solution is consistent with how people actually watch television and brings immediacy to product purchase because it focuses on the media products themselves critical to its success viewers can pause what they are watching while searching for and purchasing merchandise right from their tv and then return to their show without having missed a second a component absent from previous failed interactive advertising efforts attempted by many over the years the application of this approach to the increased use of product placements as an advertising tool is also a very promising one
8437780 in regards to our audience research amp measurement business there is no more important issue to the business of television than understanding the impact of dvrs on viewing behavior tivo has been working closely with the media industry to help bring higher levels of measurability to tv advertising similar to those achieved on the internet during the quarter we launched our power watch tm ratings service that provides for the first time a report that gives commercial ratings in a dvr environment based on demographic data this powerful research tool is essentially a companion to our flagship stop watch tm ratings service which compiles second by second behavioral and viewership data from a separate anonymous sample a critical finding of our new ratings service is that all types of viewers are fast forwarding ads at high rates and the notion that only early adopters of tivo dvrs are skipping commercials has now been debunked
8437781 we also entered into an agreement with a leading media marketing research company tra to license anonymous viewing data from tivos standalone subscription base and market a bundled offering that provides marketers with the ability to get from a single source reports that measure the effectiveness of advertising by analyzing the long sought correlation between advertising and precise purchasing data emanating from the very households that viewed the advertising the tivo tra offering not only provides this unique view but does so on an unprecedented scale for up to one million households by utilizing a proprietary method of matching anonymous viewing behavior with purchasing behavior
8437782 we believe this quarter we delivered strong financial results and continued to gain traction in our mass distribution strategy continued to expand our advertising and audience research business and continued to take the necessary steps for us to successfully capitalize on the growth opportunities in our tivo owned business in the future we are beginning to see the results of our hard work and believe that we have all the right pieces set in motion to move the business forward

8437867 sr 241 opponents specifically the surfrider foundation and the sierra clubs friends of the foothills are using sima resources to repeatedly assert false claims that the toll road will cause the closure of the san mateo campground and damage the surf break at trestles
8437868 their assertions are nonsense even a noted researcher at scripps institution of oceanography has studied the project and determined that it will have no impact on surfing or wave formation
8437869 recreational opportunities in the park san onofre state beach include the ocean the beach the trails and camping there is no reason to believe san mateo campground will be negatively impacted by the sr 241 project any more than passing trains or the movements of tens of thousands of cars and trucks on interstate 5 have impacted the popularity of the bluff campgrounds

8437903 that is a really great opportunity to get some really good attention for whistler all around the world

8437942 i do have two questions for catherynne m valente question 1 what inspired you if anything to write this particular story i read arabian nights for the first time since i was a child in the summer of 2002 it was a relatively new translation hussein haddawys rather than the typical burton collection of whitewashing additions and bowdlerizations i was fascinated by the structure how each tale broke from the previous one to give the sense of a whole though arabian nights has given us many individual tales i had just graduated from college with a degree in classical linguistics i thought entirely useless and had a bunch of mythology banging around in my head i was daydreaming on my couch in the sweltering air conditioningless rhode island summer and i thought i wonder if i could put together everything i know about mythology and folklore and language and storytelling and make a completely new myth cycle hot on the heels of that my brain piped up what if all the stories in arabian nights were really just one big story not individual ones at all brains do things like that to you sometimes dastardly things so i decided id try to write a few stories like that and give them to my niece for christmas id laminate them so she could get jam and mud all over it i wrote her a story about a prince and a goose and the thing is the story just kept opening up in my head like an origami box it just grew and grew and i suppose in some sense i grew up with it i was barely 23 when i began it and 29 when the last book was published i lived all over the world while i worked on it rhode island scotland california japan virginia and finally ohio everything i loved and learned went into it my niece never got her laminated pages but the book is dedicated to her question 2 did you write each individual story then piece them together or did you write or plan them already intertwined
8437943 actually ms valentes website has such a comprehensive faq im almost at a loss to come up with anything new but i will venture a couple first i see youve travelled to japan have you travelled extensively elsewhere and what countries places would you like to visit if you had the time and means secondly if you had the chance to travel to ancient alexandria and visit the library whose works would you seek out and why thank you very much for your time and participation here and more thanks for producing such an enchanted novel
8437944 this wasnt your typical fantasy novel and i mean that in a very good way so i was wondering what kind of works influenced you in your writing and what can you tell us about the second book in the series how did the orphans tales differ from your previously published works
8437945 1 you had dozens of story threads that you had to keep track of and tie up at the end how did you keep them all straight flow charts venn diagrams i kept seeing that scene from a beautiful mind where the room was filled with highlighted newspapers connected by red string
8437946 i was entranced by your book how did you come up with the idea to write a book of interrelating stories did you have to do much research to come up with all the different characters and mythologies
8437947 was there a reason the boy prince and the girl with the birthmark eyes had no names in the story
8437948 indeed the writing style began to positively irk me which made it increasingly difficult to stay in the story
8437949 i spent most of the book thinking the narrator was going to be the killer and was a bit disappointed when he wasnt
8437950 i found it really weird that sadie would hang out with the narrator of the story it really bugged me i was fine with her hanging out with ryan though

8437956 how is the atmosphere on stage considering the actors are now with out there jobs is it a sad place to be now that they know the news are emotions running wild

8437958 if the first movies a success how long do you think future movies would keep being produced for

8437976 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8437977 no one loved her doing it more than mark he was thrilled
8437978 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy
8437979 his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him
8437980 his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8437981 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8437982 com os olhos firmes no futuro e o esp rito de unidade com o objetivo da vit ria com f em nosso partido e em nosso pa s vamos declarar juntos em uma s voz aqui e agora que barack obama nosso candidato e ser nosso presidente
8437983 eu pe o que a conven o suspenda a tradicional vota o todos os votos declarados pelos delegados ser o contados mas eu pe o que barack obama seja eleito por esta conven o por aclama o o candidato democrata presid ncia dos estados unidos
8437984 quem concordar com o encerramento da vota o e a nomea o de barack obama por aclama o diga sim

8437986 unless the state of texas violates their own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8437987 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8437988 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8437989 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards
8437990 was hillary clintons speech more diss than endorsement for sen barack obama
8437991 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8437992 i thought she hit it out of the park clear home run she was unequivocal she said obama is my candidate and as you pointed out it was no way no how no mccain
8437993 did delegates leave that hall last night saying she shouldve been the one josh
8437994 t here are always a couple of people who are questioning but i think overall
8437995 taken a day and a half of the oxygen from this convention in denver
8437996 i dont think thats an issue at all i mean i think hillary clinton last night was there for barack obama hitting his messages do you want more of the same or do you want to stand behind somebody whos ready for change on the economy on health care on foreign policy there was no question about that and hillary clinton was there to stand up for barack obama and thats exactly what she did
8437997 most beautiful and best action fly rod i have ever used better than orvis a
8437998 i really appreciate all the great customer service you gave me and would be happy to refer you to my friends

8438000 the river run rod worked like a champ this weekend at pulaski ny
8438001 excellent salt water rod very good rod tube a 200 value
8438002 at this point were probably just going to be spoilers here were going to make other teams sweat a little
8438003 the last thing we want to do is have people come in and think were pushovers i think this series is a good message that were going to continue to fight
8438004 the pitch to hundley it kind of came out of nowhere the way he was pitching
8438005 he was cruising pretty well and all of a sudden its a 4 3 ballgame and a completely different game after that
8438006 hes one of our main guys but we dont think its a season ending injury
8438007 the time frame it fluctuates but hopefully with his youth and hes been pretty durable and resilient to injury hopefully he does get back soon
8438008 with the offseason moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it
8438009 training camp was going to be an important part of his development
8438010 thats going to be postponed obviously but hes got a lot of development on and off the court that hes going to continue to do ive got a lot of confidence in him and now his job is to get healthy
8438011 just in talking to nellie today were talking about maybe spreading that ball around and getting scoring from different areas
8438012 marcus is more of a pass first point guard if at some point he thought he didnt get a chance in new jersey hes going to get a chance now
8438013 ideally id like everybody here in oakland all the time but thats not realistic i think one thing monta has done each and every year is improve and i do believe most improvement is made during the summer thats when guys do get better so i cant debate that
8438014 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
8438015 i do think you do lose something when you start demolishing any book of the bible
8438016 microsofts strategy of an inferior product at an inferior price promises to do for on demand what zune has done for music players
8438017 part of what is momentous about this is they let us in
8438018 we arent the mainstream media but now political candidates see a value in more diverse media they realize our audience prefers our perspective rather than the mainstream
8438019 by looking at native coverage and coverage of native issues within that coverage i think that helps raise our profile
8438020 you canend up trying to read too much into the tea leaves
8438021 we have so many people coming in its been difficult to audit frankly it hasnt hurt us and then we have nfl so thats huge and very timely since it starts next week

8438024 jeff and paul have an amazing respect and understanding of the magic of the silver age and the approach of entertaining and inspiring readers by pushing the limits of the imagination and nick dragottas got the silver age style down pat
8438025 this is my choice and i have the right and the power to make it
8438026 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8438027 madame secretary madame secretary i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the further conduct of the roll call vote all votes cast by the delegates will be counted and that i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8438028 things i never thought i could write about presented themselves as possible for poetry
8438029 when im not writing i get to read poetry daily and share something with my students that is my first love and at the core of my nature and interests
8438030 what could be more wonderful then waking up going to work and getting to talk about what you love the most with people who really want to talk about it
8438031 i said something the other day and the nike people saw it and they werent happy
8438032 youre just hoping the crowd will come back hoping that guys will drop out or something
8438033 hes a very young guy hes going to be an incredible marathoner
8438034 i thought i had a chance at a medal and tried to put myself in it early
8438035 but i looked at the clock at 5k and we were already out at i think 14 55 i knew if i kept that up that i wouldnt be finishing
8438036 barack obama and these senate candidates will make the right choices to deliver the change we need for our generation and for charlies well solve our energy crisis provide affordable quality health care to all americans and bring our troops home from iraq so we can address problems here at home
8438037 its exciting to be here to be able to have a speaking role at that moment just after barack obama was officially nominated its a kick
8438038 its beginning to be recognized it has to be part of our partys dialogue
8438039 hes a young man and hes got a back like mine its not good

8438074 we are deeply appreciative of this generous gift by mr wang a loyal donor and friend of the university
8438075 as a scholar of english literature i am particularly excited about the opportunity to further strengthen the status of our department of english it is also an honor for this university to house the taiwan resource center the only specialized library collection of its kind in the united states

8438083 men are more inclined than women to exhibit a range of risk taking behaviours while on the road
8438084 men are more inclined to speed show aggression fall asleep behind the wheel and to identify themselves as impatient

8438086 men are more likely to be involved in an accident due to overconfident or risky driving and women are more likely to have had difficulty judging distances but are generally more courteous on the road

8438091 its been a good camp but it comes to the point where you have to put them out on the field and thats where we are now if you ask any coach or any player across the country they would say they are absolutely ready to play
8438092 thats the key but theres no secret you know their heights their weights and you know they are good receivers we have to do a great job of defending those guys
8438093 were ready to see these guys under the lights and in front of their moms relatives and thousands and thousands of ole miss fans
8438094 were ready to see that you want to see how they respond and how they take to the coaching and all that were just ready

8438108 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8438109 i think we need to see the united states and see the world through eyes that are younger through eyes that have dreams through eyes that see something new for the nation
8438110 just let me live til voting time in november in my lifetime we just might get to see the first african american president
8438111 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8438112 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8438113 there are stark differences on the economy senator mccain thinks were on the right path and senator obama knows most people disagree with that
8438114 mccain is wedded not just to the bush economic policy but also to the bush foreign policy
8438115 senator mccain and his people are shooting barbs about the opulence of our convention from the mountaintop in sedona at the mccain estate
8438116 the wrong type of people in society are breeding them for their own gains and then dogs are just being abandoned
8438117 people who are abusing drugs are breeding the dogs to raise funds to buy the substances theyre abusing and this just seems to be happening all over britain at the moment
8438118 last year we had to give up on two young staffies because they couldnt be trusted with people they were vicious dogs
8438119 unfortunately we just had to give up on them and they had to be put to sleep
8438120 the people that are on drugs or are into dodgy dealings they will buy them as a status symbol
8438121 theyre macho hard tough dogs and they buy them they breed them they cant get people to take them on or theyre passing them on to other undesirable people and theyre having more litters and the problem just escalates

8438130 the last set of readings i saw before we went dark looked like a cascade failure starting in the communication systems
8438131 the intercepted message captain it couldve been a trojan horse a way to slip a computer virus past our defenses
8438132 power up the main computer with a portable generator wipe its command protocols and restore from the protected backup
8438133 i didnt ask for a checklist karl i asked how long
8438134 we have full power captain but still no command inputs
8438135 we were disabled the romulans couldve destroyed the convoy why use us to do it
8438136 this is a trial run for how theyll attack the rest of the fleet were just the guinea pigs
8438137 captain i think weve got a shot at getting out of this with our skins but itll be tight
8438138 when the romulans powered us up for the attack on the convoy they left a residual charge in the warp nacelles we can trigger a manual release and make a half second warp jump
8438139 ive got biggs and pierce venting plasma through the impulse manifold and the macos are pushing a photonic warhead out of the launch bay if we detonate the warhead and trigger the jump at exactly the same moment it should look like we self destructed

8438147 were just looking to trim those flights that dont have heavy demand even in busy times
8438148 i dont see these changes making a dramatic difference in how the whole fannie and freddie fiasco plays out
8438149 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
8438150 most managers are taking the position that it would unthinkable to imagine a scenario where the government wouldnt back the debt
8438151 the end result is probably going to be that they go bankrupt and the government nationalizes the function

8438154 it is really hard to get your head around the fact that when your child goes on an excursion they need to have a permission slip signed by the parent but the school is within its rights to take a child to the doctor to be put on the pill
8438155 alle respect voor liverpool maar het is niet het beste team dat gewonnen heeft
8438156 we hebben goed gespeeld onze organisatie was perfect ik ben fier op mijn team we hebben hier heel wat kansen gehad en in de heenwedstrijd misten we al een penalty e n foutje kost ons de kwalificatie als je er zo dicht bij was kun je niet anders dan ontgoocheld zijn de arbitrage floot in het voordeel van liverpool maar dat is nu niet belangrijk ik wens liverpool het allerbeste in het vervolg van de competitie
8438157 we wisten dat het een heel moeilijke wedstrijd zou worden
8438158 net als in de heenwedstrijd heeft standard goed gespeeld ze hebben ons hard doen werken wij hebben de wedstrijd wel gecontroleerd maar tot echte kansen kwamen we niet gelukkig maakte kuyt het in de slotfase dan toch af
8438159 era fondamentale passare il turno abbiamo meritato la qualificazione mi viene da dire adesso viene il bello speriamo che sia cos dora in avanti dovremo avere ancora pi coraggio ma la squadra ha dato tutto molti giocatori avevano i crampi nel primo tempo abbiamo costruito molto nella seconda frazione abbiamo rischiato di prendere gol ma siamo sempre stati in partita emozione forte abbiamo regalato ai nostri tifosi tutto questo
8438160 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal lt
8438161 gt mdg of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one percentage point a year since 1981
8438162 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8438163 the new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurement because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries

8438165 mr broadus has not been granted a visa there are further steps required beyond character assessment before a visa is granted

8438168 theyve all got special memories attached to them of course
8438169 i really would love to have them back anonymously would be wonderful
8438170 just when i was starting to regain a little faith in government it has see sawed again i can only hope when national gains power this year it simply amends this section of the policing bill back to the status quo and demonstrates its faith in community minded police officers
8438171 its a strong matter of principle that has been dealt with in a very unprincipled way police officers are becoming more and more isolated from the community its just another nail in the coffin
8438172 this just defecates all over the fantastic records of a number of police and it relegates them to the lower order
8438173 theres everything from hip hop break beats drum n bass dubstep and electro
8438174 its a dance party and not many of those go on around here and its local talent and its a good excuse to dress up like a creature
8438175 its really cool to support people right here people are like we can go to wellys for a gig we can go to auckland for a gig but its like why not stay here for a gig
8438176 theres going to be a panda hopefully a gorilla barney rubble is going to be there there should be a few cave men a few witch doctors and medicine men and the occasional lichen
8438177 i dont only speak for myself when i say that we the students the staff you know humans have had enough of your rampant transportational bitchery
8438178 there i am at 4 56pm getting on a bus labelled a 12 hoping in vain it will turn out to be a 12 for real even though i know its almost certainly one of your wacky pranks
8438179 im happy to write a letter which says the language and the tone i took could have been more carefully moderated
8438180 i could have been much more diplomatic about the way i approached it
8438181 there were some concerns that obviously needed looking at and addressing
8438182 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god this contest will be a way to show that beauty isnt just what we see on television but also a more discreet charm
8438183 my superiors were not happy the bishop was not happy
8438184 but they did not understand me either no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
8438185 oh youre still in bali you must really love it

8438187 you have to back off get out of the zone
8438188 c alifornia is another country you wake up in the morning and new york is already on its first coffee and the first scandal has broken in washington one more republican crony caught with his hand in the honey pot it all feels very far away
8438189 am i a young christian like these trees how well am i rooted
8438190 make every effort to give yourself to god as the kind of person he will accept be a worker who is not ashamed and who uses the true teaching in the right way
8438191 earth and sky will be destroyed but the words i have spoken will never be destroyed
8438192 its in your blood its part of your life i dont want to quit being a cartoonist
8438193 its tough to put it down you still think of gags and at the same time i knew id be looking at material that id want to improve
8438194 i thought i would now be a retired woman with my tilley hat and sitting on a cruise ship and going to the galapagos
8438195 i really wanted to be happy as a couple and make everything right but things became more stressful it made me look again at my career
8438196 its going back to the beginning when michael and elizabeth were very young
8438197 im going back to do it how it should have been done im beginning with all this knowledge so its a much more comprehensive beginning i only have an insular world of characters from 1979 to work with
8438198 nobody has done it before most people die or the strip ends
8438199 in october it will be a ratio of 50 50 the color sunday comics will be all new material i think it will be 50 50 for the first year at least
8438200 the descriptive new runs was new to us but it does hint at the blend of new and old that shell undertake
8438201 its quite a gamble on her part and much of this terrain will be new to her too only time will tell if its effective or not
8438202 you know people are always going to drop your strip thats what editors do
8438203 dean young and i joke that we keep taking each others place on the comics page if you write for editors so that they will keep your work youll be losing clients and readers its just part of it i dont want to lose papers but i know that i will
8438204 in this business youre a perfectionist youve got to be
8438205 my early work on the strip was freer it was more spontaneous but i want to combine the confidence and experience i have now with that freedom thats the best of all worlds
8438206 the analogy would be like decorating a room once youve done everything you can do to it you step back and realize you cant do any more i wanted to stop the story while it was still a reasonably good story you cant fulfill everyones needs ive told the story i cant do any more to redecorate this room
8438207 the only thing ive put in the strip with a sarcastic streak toward my ex husband is john pattersons potbelly because my ex is very proud of his physique
8438208 perhaps i made up my own husband and saw john patterson in my husband
8438209 n er vi kommet til amerika og her snakker de bare tull
8438210 the act does have need for a protection where passionate people speak out against planning and we should be able to do that without concern that we will end up in a court facing huge costs that will silence us
8438211 we are showing the way again to other states and hopefully the commonwealth so that people will have the right to speak out on issues that theyre passionate about
8438212 minister the union is fed up ambulance crews are fed up the ambulances are lining up for hours at a time and out of service what are you doing about it
8438213 there were people who supported the war and people who opposed the war inside that convention hall
8438214 but what people are unified about is that when we make a decision to go to war that it should not be ideologically driven that it should be driven by a set of facts and common sense with regards to how we mobilize our country and our national interest
8438215 and i think that there is a strong feeling that even among those that supported george bushs decision initially to go in that there was some fudging of the numbers and shading of the truth and that as a consequence of our inability to create a strong alliance around our actions that we are now stuck in a quagmire that is going to cost us not only billions of dollars but thousands of lives and will require a much longer term commitment than the american voters had intended when they rallied behind the president
8438216 well how does electing john kerry resolve that dilemma for america
8438217 if you look at what has happened over the last several months i think there is a convergence basically the bush administration has moved in the direction of its critics in trying to internationalize the reconstruction process so i am not sure that on paper the differences between the bush administration and a kerry administration would be significant
8438218 all of us assume that when we make that commitment that we have to finish the job we owe it not only to the troops who sacrificed their lives but also the iraqi people
8438219 and i think that there is a strong impression that the bush administration has squandered its will on the international stage and that john kerry would come in with a broader vision and the possibility of bringing people onboard in a way that is necessary for our long term success
8438220 presidents often talk about the importance of their personal relations with other leaders but essentially that is a lot of hooey you know nations do things because of national interest
8438221 whether john kerry is in the white house or george bush is in the white house that is not going to cause the french or the germans or the russians or others who do not see it in their national interest to be engaged in iraq right now to suddenly say well john i like you a lot better than i liked george
8438222 i do not think that it is a function of like or dislike
8438223 all of this culminating in iraq leading up to iraq but a pattern established that the united states is not interested in our national interest that they do not want to sit down at our table and how to figure out how this is good for us as well as the united states theyre willing to make their own decisions
8438224 it is that pattern on the part of the bush administration that i think has made it so difficult for us to craft the kind of strategies that we need in hot areas like the middle east
8438225 but do you think that most the delegates on the floor really understand that president kerry is not going to pursue a policy in iraq that is essentially different from the one that george bush is pursuing
8438226 i think that they recognize that we cannot afford to simply cut and run in iraq and that we are in a difficult situation right now and i think that what they are hoping for is somebody who is going to bring a thoughtfulness and a base of experience to decision making in the white house which john kerry possesses and i think that george bush does not
8438227 well ted you have been there and i have not
8438228 i do not know whether or not we can accomplish that in six months if we can then i think john kerry will bring our troops home
8438229 my assumption would be that if we could actually stabilize iraq in such a way that you do not have warfare between the sunnis the shiias and the kurds some semblance of law and order in that country then i think that there is no doubt that the kerry administration is going to be interested in bringing back the reservists and the national guardsmen who are currently there but
8438230 i think it is also true that the bush administration would bring the troops back
8438231 well but as i said before part of what we are struggling with here part of what is at stake is not simply the decision making in iraq
8438232 what is at stake is an overall approach to foreign policy that has been characterized in the bush administration by unilateralism and a disdain for world opinion that has concrete consequences over time
8438233 we got a driver who drove the bus into the ditch now we can argue about how that happened but weve got to get the bus out of the ditch that does not mean you dont fire the driver and the question is who do we trust over the long term to direct our foreign policy in a way that meets international interests makes us strong here at home creates the kind of or restores us to kind of respect that weve had in the past abroad and i think that the estimation of those in the convention is that they trust john kerry to make those decisions better than george bush will make those decisions
8438234 the united states is not interested in our national interest that they do not want to sit down at our table and how to figure out how this is good for us as well as the united states theyre willing to make their own decisions
8438235 it is that pattern on the part of the bush administration that i think has made it so difficult for us to craft the kind of strategies that we need in hot areas like the middle east
8438236 this will not resonate with the bo voters that was then when the war was in its infancy this is now
8438237 i think that they recognize that we cannot afford to simply cut and run in iraq and that we are in a difficult situation right now and i think that what they are hoping for is somebody who is going to bring a thoughtfulness and a base of experience to decision making in the white house
8438238 post racial candidate is the one who has played the race card many times in this campaign for his benefit
8438239 because i dont look that the presidents on our money
8438240 clinging to guns and religion having antiphy toward those who are not like them
8438241 i dont want to rasie my daughter in a country like this
8438242 i think that they recognize that we cannot afford to simply cut and run in iraq and that we are in a difficult situation right now and i think that what they are hoping for is somebody who is going to bring a thoughtfulness and a base of experience to decision making in the white house which john kerry possesses and i think that george bush does not
8438243 is established by life and the commandments given us by god through his prophets and it gradually becomes the basis for the formation in man of what is called conscience
8438244 subjective morality is invented by man and is therefore a relative conception differing for different people and different places
8438245 battery homicide and suicide often occur simply because people stuff their children while the future adult is still being formed in them with all sorts of conventions and so prevent nature herself from developing in them that conscience which has taken form over thousands of years of struggle by our ancestors against just such conventions
8438246 from the conventions with which one is stuffed subjective morality is formed but for real life objectivity is needed which comes only from conscience
8438247 subjective morality is a relative conception and if you are filled with relative conceptions then when you are grown up you will always and everywhere act and judge other people according to the conventional views and notions you have acquired you must learn not what people round you consider good or bad but to act in life as your conscience bids you an untrammelled conscience will always know more than all the books and teachers put together
8438248 the market is likely to be firm today we are likely to havesome sunshine after days of rain
8438249 the outlook for the second half of the year ischallenging but we are still very confident about themedium term outlook for the market

8438252 in fighting climate change we must look beyond the emissions from our own operations and look closely into the products and services we use and the suppliers we work with i am very pleased that defra is one of the first organisations to participate in this really important pilot project
8438253 i am pleased that the fco through its collaboration with the carbon disclosure project is leading government in the area of gaining a better understanding of the impacts of its expenditure decisions on carbon emissions throughout the supply chain understanding the carbon emissions and policies of our suppliers will help to embed the sustainability agenda within our procurement decision making
8438254 gloucestershire county council is committed to both minimising our own carbon emissions and working with our partners to reduce emissions from the whole county we are pleased to be part if this pioneering initiative to understand the carbon impact of council purchasing we are working with 2 000 of our suppliers to help them understand the impacts of their products and services and so reduce our contribution to further climate change
8438255 the public sector has enormous power to shape new markets through its procurement practices and these organisations are showing the way in the development of a low carbon economy by joining this project the public sector has positioned itself at the cutting edge of this issue and will be learning with the private sector rather than from it

8438280 unity realized hillary suspends roll call and formally nominates obama
8438281 whats so great about not being president you obamabots and your messiah meh spin all you want im independent with like a mind and everything you cant sway me
8438282 heard david brooks say with democrats ahead almost 10 20 points on some issues why is the race two party preffered almost a dead heat
8438283 i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the further conduct of the roll cal vote all votes cast by the delegates will be counted and i move myself be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8438284 supporters of hillary rodham clinton furiously circulated petitions on the floor of the democratic national convention last night
8438285 the move being worked out between the obama campaign and officials behind clintons suspended bid would work in two parts delegates would cast votes at their hotels wednesday morning that night at the pepsi center convention site the roll call process would rely on the votes cast that morning
8438286 colorado rep diana degette a former state co chair for clinton said she knows the camps are in negotiations about what to do
8438287 in 2004 bush accepted his nomination before a backdrop of greek revival columns too heres an image this 2004 ceremony of course would have been partly produced by none other than the rnc
8438288 madam chair the proud state of alabama the heart of dixie the land of cotton the cradle of the civil rights movement is thrilled to cast
8438289 theres a small handful but a number have been pushed back from september and october to december well still have some of those films
8438290 but in some ways were getting back to our roots by having more of an international selection
8438291 i think its also true that some films we thought would be finished were put on hold
8438292 so the director could make another film before june 30
8438293 what was obvious to me in cannes is that there were fewer high quality american independent films and more foreign language films
8438294 i think its cyclical last year was a particularly strong year for american auteurs this year france and italy are particularly strong
8438295 everyone including ourselves were taken by surprise by the movie
8438296 since there is such a self selecting group of critics who are cinephiles up there we thought it would give them a chance to see it outside of the crowds and evaluate it on its own terms
8438297 it allowed us to position the film and by the time of toronto there was already a tremendous buzz
8438298 now that these festivals have a much higher profile with the internet and heightened intensity and visibility
8438299 the distribs are thinking about the pros and cons of going to an early fall festival
8438300 the marketplace simply could not withstand that overcrowding and many strong films suffered as a result
8438301 this year i think things have contracted a bit and there are less of these films and theyre being positioned differently
8438302 everything that is significant in terms of an awards worthy film weve gotten a look at
8438303 especially strong films a lot of them based around performances
8438304 last year was a groundswell year with many of our finest filmmakers with new work
8438305 while im sure well have a number of u s films in the program i dont know if there will be the profile that we had last year

8438423 i judge this program not by the number we have served but by the homeowners we havent yet been able help
8438424 we will focus these next months on working with individual homeowners to resolve their outstanding issues and to help them get the rebuilding dollars they desperately need
8438425 we had hoped that by offering case by case extensions we could help individual applicants in the program because of the extremely difficult issues facing our homeowners and because these extensions were not always provided on a consistent basis we determined that the fairest action to take was to give everyone affected more time

8438474 i finished sixth last year at duquoin and i was pretty disappointed with that mondays race is another opportunity to make the climb forward and put this team in victory lane
8438475 these dirt races are over in a hurry feels more like a long heat race than an actual arca race
8438476 the goal for duquoin is to get a good reading in practice then make our presence known in qualifying and stay a contender in the race if we can do all that then the southern illinois 100 is our oyster
8438477 last year we ran good at all three tracks but this challenge is different from the actual points championship which gives me an extra drive i feel confident in our equipment and a year later i have a ton more experience so the crown is ours to lose

8438493 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8438494 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8438495 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8438496 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8438497 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8438514 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8438515 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the democratic nominee for president of the united states
8438516 ive seen war up close not as a political slogan or some think tank theory
8438517 i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies and consult with our allies a president who has the judgment to use war as a last resort not a first resort a president who can adapt to new situations as things change instead of being stuck in the past
8438518 i am much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8438519 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8438520 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8438521 its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up
8438522 im happy to look them in the eye and say what needs to be said im happy to tell them what i think im not going to avoid them

8438525 cind ii vezi ca vin cu asa viteza nu iti mai vine sa treci chiar daca ai dreptul sint unii care nici nu se uita ca e trecere sau daca vrea cineva sa treaca stai cuminte pe margine si cind prinzi ocazia treci
8438526 de obicei astept pina se raresc masinile care circula si apoi traversez daca ma grabesc ma bag sa traversez si sper sa opreasca ei
8438527 stiti cum e la noi in iasi si ar duce masinile pina in casa daca ar putea unde au treaba acolo o lasa nu ii intereseaza de ceilalti n am vazut pe nici unul care sa o lase intr o parcare si sa mearga zece metri pe jos
8438528 intr adevar creeaza probleme pentru ca se reduce vizibilitatea si te trezesti cu pietonul pe capota oricum in apropiere de trecere trebuie redusa viteza dar chiar si asa riscul este ridicat pentru ca pur si simplu nu il vezi cred ca cele mai mari probleme sint in pacurari cind vii spre oras in canta unde circula si tir urile in nicolina si in dacia
8438529 daca ma duc sa caut un loc de parcare pierd timp si trebuie sa vin cu marfa in brate oricum nu stau mult
8438530 am treaba doar citeva minute da stiu ca nu am voie sa parchez dar nu stau mult crezi ca as gasi vreun loc de parcare in apropiere
8438531 s a facut propunere catre primarie pentru ca pe pacurari sa fie amplasati popici inaintea trecerilor de pietoni pe prima banda astfel incit soferii sa fie nevoiti sa intre pe banda a doua de circulatie in acest fel masinile nu vor mai putea fi parcate aproape de trecere sau pe marcaj
8438532 nu imi dau seama cum s ar putea monta popici in banda de circulatie pentru ca acolo traficul trebuie sa aiba fluenta

8438619 the wrong type of people in society are breeding them for their own gains and then dogs are just being abandoned
8438620 people who are abusing drugs are breeding the dogs to raise funds to buy the substances theyre abusing and this just seems to be happening all over britain at the moment
8438621 last year we had to give up on two young staffies because they couldnt be trusted with people they were vicious dogs
8438622 unfortunately we just had to give up on them and they had to be put to sleep
8438623 the people that are on drugs or are into dodgy dealings they will buy them as a status symbol
8438624 theyre macho hard tough dogs and they buy them they breed them they cant get people to take them on or theyre passing them on to other undesirable people and theyre having more litters and the problem just escalates

8438627 at this point of time i was hoping to see government funding
8438628 the problem is this is a big project and we are reasonably committed already
8438629 we have sort of done it perhaps we have been wrong in thinking we can get money from government
8438630 if you can all of a sudden find 225 000 in your budget then perhaps your budget is too big
8438631 this is a vision exercise its probably the biggest economic development in the district that is going to happen in the next 10 years it is going to create competition for telecom and everyone stands to get the benefit
8438632 just when i was starting to regain a little faith in government it has see sawed again i can only hope when national gains power this year it simply amends this section of the policing bill back to the status quo and demonstrates its faith in community minded police officers
8438633 its a strong matter of principle that has been dealt with in a very unprincipled way police officers are becoming more and more isolated from the community its just another nail in the coffin
8438634 this just defecates all over the fantastic records of a number of police and it relegates them to the lower order

8438643 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8438644 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8438645 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8438646 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add
8438647 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8438648 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8438649 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8438650 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone

8438671 there was information gathered through either staff or inmates that there was an escape plan
8438672 but they couldnt determine what unit was involved which inmates whether it was from inside the unit or outside the prison on maybe an escort or something so they were just trying to glean some of that information
8438673 theres always information coming forth regarding escapes and they told me that they monitor the situation they do due diligence they investigate the actual tips that come in and the intelligence and then they digest it and go from there
8438674 in this case with no specifics they didnt feel it necessary to lock down the whole prison

8438721 i think we are at a time now where we are sharing that is where the game is now i learned a lot competing against the spanish coach against the greek team i learned the great spirit of the argentina team i am not sure we can duplicate that and the instincts and toughness of the greek team
8438722 by the time we got to my house our whole team was at my house and that was really a good thing
8438723 they got to greet us but not just me and my family but wojo and chris actually just before we left in july our whole team came out the night before so that was a good bookend
8438724 we didnt do anything after the dream team except select another team
8438725 we are not going to make that mistake again we being a basketball community ill help whether it be just as a consultant or friend or somebody who has been through this for the last three years and has lived it every day of my life for the last three years
8438726 for the rest of my career im not going into that relief thing we are going to go after it and we are going to do it
8438727 our team is going to have fun it is going to be represented and they are going to have an opportunity to grow just like our olympic team did
8438728 letting them pour water on his head and mess up his hair and just the joy and excitement it wasnt a relief it was joy and excitement of winning and the three year commitment and the time he put in to making things right everything couldnt have worked out better
8438729 omfg i have issues and i cant sell anything and holy fuck im going to be poor for the rest of my life
8438730 ok who needs help and how can we help them

8438735 the simple fact is were not doing right by our veterans
8438736 not here in montana and not anywhere in the united states
8438737 im actually republican originally and i think barack is a much better candidate than our alternative
8438738 everybody says that he hasnt had that much experience but i just think he knows what hes talking about
8438739 were sure hoping hes going to end up in the office do all that we can to see that he does
8438740 i have to take entire days off work drive 800 miles roundtrip to get a mammogram and come back so its good to hear that hes so concerned about things like that
8438741 hes done his research and he knows a lot about veterans and what the veterans need
8438742 whats not smart is having under performing schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not doing anything about it
8438743 our whole plan is to analyse student population and to compare like schools with like schools
8438744 if you saw differences with outcomes then that is to do with the quality of what is happening with that school
8438745 and youd get the best practice from the highest achieving schools and take it to the schools that were falling behind to make sure every kid got the best education
8438746 we are standing here ready to make extra resources available to the schools that are falling behind but we want to make sure we understand exactly whats going on
8438747 how do you compare two schools to come up with a sort of ranking
8438748 its an absolute nonsense its more than unfair its actually corrupt
8438749 its a misuse of government policy to say that we will give money that is owned by the public to their own schools and to say we will give it to some schools more but not to others based on how we determine who were going to give it to
8438750 how do you measure the success of that school in simplistic testing terms and then bully the school by saying unless you reach this artificial benchmark were going to withdraw funding to you and punish you
8438751 once the teachers union gets a hold of this theyll tear it to pieces
8438752 can we please figure out a way to get rid of the alp and coalition as the major players in australian politics
8438753 any teacher who can be replaced by a computer should be
8438754 that long term poverty is caused not by economics but by a dysfunctional set of values
8438755 if you are not with us you are against us
8438756 and youd get the best practice from the highest achieving schools and take it to the schools that were falling behind to make sure every kid got the best education
8438757 the government says it will make federal education funding conditional on the publication of details about schools performances with teachers and other staff facing the threat of dismissal if their schools consistently underperform
8438758 we are going through and looking to ensure that things that happen at josephine county here
8438759 all these other big catches weve had weve been able to trace back to the egg mass someone brought from back east

8438781 if there are people who have been mistakenly executed they didnt have a second chance
8438782 if you jailed some guy for ten years then let him out and tell him sorry we made a mistake do you think he would have preferred to be executed at the beginning than to suffer ten years imprisonment
8438783 i figure he would have preferred to be imprisoned rather than executed
8438784 what makes you so sure thats hindsight if only you could ask those who have been executed whether they would have chosen to be imprisoned indefinitely you wouldnt be so sure
8438785 the problem is that we can only interview those who have survived and ask for their opinions

8438796 obama supports abortion a system responsible for the murder of children
8438797 what were celebrating is something that we should be mindful of and that is that there absolutely is in our party a tremendous intersection of faith and politics
8438798 inherent in the practice of the death penalty is the practice of mental torture
8438799 if we understand what were doing in our own killing chambers we will better understand what happened at abu ghraib and whats happening at guantanamo and how it has happened that our own attorney general and lawyers from our justice department employed shocking legalisms to bypass the geneva conventions in order to legitimize torture of suspected terrorists
8438800 our children have sacred value and each child is equally valuable
8438801 some of us democrats have philosophic humanitarian and theological differences with those who put forth abortion as an appropriate routine and acceptable birth control procedure
8438802 surely we cannot be pleased with the routine administration of millions of surgically terminated pregnancies
8438803 something within us must be calling for a better way if we do not resist at this point at what point will we resist
8438804 we didnt move to bring faith to the party faith was already here

8438824 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8438825 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8438826 from thursday im an obama person today i cast my vote for hillary clinton as that was the mandate i was given by my state
8438827 she has unified us and now it is up to him to close the deal he has to take her message to the hinterland small towns in alabama he has to carry that message to them he has to use words that talk to us
8438828 my party must win and barack obama shares 98 percent if not 100 percent of the values that i have and that hillary has i think a vote for obama is a vote for hillary and vice versa
8438829 my parents would turn in their graves if i did anything else
8438830 but wyoming was the first state in the world to grant voting rights to women and i wanted to cast my vote for a woman president
8438831 most smart businesspeople involved in start ups recognize what adam smith did in the mid 1700s that specialization leads to better outcomes for all concerned
8438832 in my crrystal ball i see i see i see a shinier head
8438833 seems like a new person its almost as if the injection made him stronger
8438834 lets declare together in once voiced right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8438835 we need a president like abraham lincoln someone with ideas who says lets go to the moon with technology that would fit in your cell phone
8438836 from this day on the official language of san marcos will be swedish silence in addition to that all citizens will be required to change their underwear every half hour underwear will be worn on the outside so we can check furthermore all children under 16 years old are now 16 years old
8438837 obviously the war is a very important issue to me we need to get our troops home and we need to get them home now my own personal feelings about it is when the world is kind of perfect and we have those two things when were at peace and everybody has a good job although we should be working on these at the same time i dont mean to imply otherwise im really a big advocate for health care and of course my heart lies with education
8438838 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him
8438839 we need a president like abraham lincoln someone with ideas who says lets go to the moon with technology that would fit in your cell phone
8438840 we ran a positive campaign we campaigned on the issues the issue is leadership leadership for the future ask not what you can do for your country the people have spoken the only thing we have to fear is fear itself if you cant stand the heat stay out of the kitchen live free or die and in conclusion read my lips
8438841 we need a president like abraham lincoln someone with ideas who says lets go to the moon with technology that would fit in your cell phone
8438842 by 2020 youre looking at 15 percent of the national demand for electric energy in brazil
8438843 it is renewable it is clean and it is a by product of something else it just increases the benefits of the biofuel
8438844 it is another benefit you are getting from cane now you can light up a city before it was just enough to run your operation
8438845 men are more inclined than women to exhibit a range of risk taking behaviours while on the road
8438846 men are more inclined to speed show aggression fall asleep behind the wheel and to identify themselves as impatient
8438847 insurance premiums usually take gender into account for these very reasons
8438848 men are more likely to be involved in an accident due to overconfident or risky driving and women are more likely to have had difficulty judging distances but are generally more courteous on the road
8438849 oh yeah has this ever happened to you you know when its less than a week from the start of school but you havent even realized it and then you see the calender and you make a face like this
8438850 there is no way you can introduce someone to our sport in one day because the top events take at least three days to produce a result so i have been desperate to create a showcase event to market the sport to new spectators and new sponsors
8438851 in this event we are putting the best bits of the three disciplines together in a shortened format and coming up with something really exciting
8438852 when the lights go up the hairs on the back on your neck will stand on end people will know from the outset that this is not traditional eventing
8438853 the scoring system will be simplified so everyone knows exactly what each rider has done and what they need to do and as the competition hots up the best placed riders will go last
8438854 the riders will wear traditional wear in the dressage but new performance clothing in the show jumping and cross country this does not mean we are going down the pyjama route of cricket but we have developed clothing that will be good for the riders and the sport
8438855 i would also love our riders to become household names all around the world because personalities promote sport and we need to promote our sport to make sure it continues to grow
8438856 seeing the top riders competing in the three phases in such an exciting environment is bound to breed interest among the youngsters and will also make for fantastic television
8438857 here is going to be a really great service you are going to love it meanwhile while you wait with no news sorry too busy to bother with letting you know the state of progress with our great new service please just stay here for as long as you can as here are some really great ads bye see you one day maybe
8438858 contrary to some voices out there we do have plans for future development and we will involve our developer community as much as we can just to reiterate we are working very hard to ensure you have a useful and usable service
8438859 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8438860 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8438861 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8438862 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8438863 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8438864 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8438865 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up
8438866 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8438867 we are happy to announce the release of lrg complete 3 as a final version
8438868 blogging is the most democratic form of communication yet realized the medium is wide open with almost no barriers to entry

8438870 its customary to say we lost the vietnam war but whos we

8438872 government subsidies and new regulations have quietly funneled money from the poor and the middle class to the rich and politically connected
8438873 but he didnt know that money trickled up give it to the people at the bottom and the people at the top will have it before night anyhow but it will at least have passed through the poor fellows hands

8438876 the economy will grow at a moderate pace for a while somewhat below the rate of increase of its potential and then growth will begin to strengthen
8438877 the federal reserve has returned short term interest rates only to more normal levels and long term rates are unusually low relative to those short term rates

8438880 if the fighting will continue for every civilian killed we will execute 10 moro rebels
8438881 the civilians are suffering now thats why we are asking the leadership of the milf to stop its harassment and attacks in mindanao because it will only complicate the life of the people
8438882 came from their elders during the time of commander toothpick
8438883 our instruction to them is not to go to battle if they have done something wrong against other people to follow gods commandments to avoid accidents that may lead to their deaths
8438884 the government must be held responsible for any act of this gang
8438885 we hold the philippine government responsible for whatever savagery barbarism destruction committed by this gangster group against the bangsamoro people
8438886 the creation of the ilaga group is not necessary we have the military
8438887 mindanao is not only for the muslims but for christians and lumad as well because we are the ones that form the tri people group the owner of mindanao
8438888 we need to unite muslims christians and lumad and my message to the muslim admire what the milf group is doing because it will only destroy the development in the region
8438889 we must shun the leadership of the milf they are the ones that destroy our life look at what is happening around you many civilians have been affected
8438890 we are for arming civilians in areas targeted by milf for them to defend their families and properties
8438891 i am asking those who will join in the future to strictly follow our constitution
8438892 we will let authorities hunt them with the bounty for their arrest their followers will hand them to authorities
8438893 we gave a one week warning against kato and bravo before to stop launching attacks we are happy that they listen to us but if they launch attacks again we will fight
8438894 after the fighting broke out they approached us and asked if we can help
8438895 our warfare style is not offensive but defensive i think the situation will not get worse but if the milf will launch other attacks we are ready to fight
8438896 the whole reason i came on here was to get exposure and to show people something
8438897 people get all sad like this is the end or something or you just disappear off the planet or something but its not like that like i said before its just another stepping stone you just continue on you have your direction you want to go and nothing can sway your dream of what you want everything to be so you just continue on the path and see what happens maybe winning wouldve been the most detrimental thing in the world you dont even know really whatever happens you just accept it
8438898 mark priestley was a tremendous young person loved and respected by his fellow all saints cast members and crew

8438907 all mankind is of one author and is one volume when one man dies one chapter is not torn out of the book but translated into a better language and every chapter must be so translated as therefore the bell that rings to a sermon calls not upon the preacher only but upon the congregation to come so this bell calls us all but how much more me who am brought so near the door by this sickness no man is an island entire of itself any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee

8439179 the last thing we want to do is have people come in and think were pushovers i think this series is a good message that were going to continue to fight
8439180 the pitch to hundley it kind of came out of nowhere the way he was pitching
8439181 he was cruising pretty well and all of a sudden its a 4 3 ballgame and a completely different game after that
8439182 were not competing with telecom providers but the volume of data we need to move around the world has grown to the point where in some cases weve exceeded the ability traditional players can offer

8439184 access messages in a selective manner based on the identity of the caller the need to listen to the actual voice messages to determine the callers identity and the need to listen to the messages sequentially or chronologically is obviated saving both time and effort

8439191 through my positions as a member of the house armed services committee and as chairman of the coast guard and maritime transportation subcommittee i can tell you that there is no greater threat to our national security than a continuation of the policies of george w bush
8439192 the coast guards motto is simple yet forceful semper paratus meaning always ready
8439193 georgia is in ruins the taliban is rejuvenated in afghanistan pakistan is unstable iran is a growing threat russian aggression is on the rise and new democratic movements in the ukraine and other nations are at risk all because the bush administration was not ready americas influence in the world is reduced and the threats to our nation are even greater and incredibly senator mccain wants to continue the failed policies that got us here

8439196 the roads in new zealand have a good rhythm and they are so smooth that theres no need to worry about damaging the car on rocks
8439197 its important to win rallies for our title challenges but if i cant do that then i have to score as many points as possible
8439198 i have always enjoyed this rally ever since i first came here in 2002 the lush green backdrop to the stages is magnificent
8439199 the stages are fast and technically demanding but the cars dont suffer its certainly one of my favourite events
8439200 its a long way to get there but i love the new zealand stages and also the country itself
8439201 the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8439202 an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
8439203 i did draw djokavic in the first round but someone has to play him and youve got to beat everybody to get the gold medal so i had to play him eventually
8439204 those semifinals will definitely be a memorable moment in my career
8439205 ive had a lot of great success here i come here and im always excited to play in front of the fans its a lot of energy out there on every match that i play in and i feed off it quite well
8439206 i got off to a great start which i thought was going to be the key for me today
8439207 toward the third set he started serving a lot better
8439208 as the match gets tighter i cant go for shot the way i did the first two sets but overall i felt good and its always tough to play first rounds no matter where you are
8439209 his defensive mentality and selfless approach to the game are consistent with what we are working to establish in oklahoma city
8439210 the total investment of the project is expected to be about 3 billion iraq has toughened the terms changing the contract to a set fee service deal from the oil production sharing agreement signed under saddam iraq needs billions of dollars of investment in its energy sector after years of war and sanctions but with high oil prices and strong competition for access to some of the worlds cheapest oil to produce iraq has been negotiating from a position of strength under the revised contract adhab will produce 110 000 barrels per day bpd up from the previous target of 90 000 bpd shahristani said first output would come in three years and the field should pump for 20 years he said cnpc would own 75 percent of a joint venture to be set up for the contract while iraqs northern oil company would own 25 percent he added the value of the contract would be reviewed every quarter he said the deal was pending the final seal from both countries governments the probability of a series of short term service contracts with oil majors going ahead was falling after delays in signing although negotiations were ongoing shahristani said iraq had wanted six contracts to boost oil output by 100 000 bpd each to be signed in june and implemented within a year baghdad does not want to extend the end date for the contracts as it plans to sign long term deals for the same fields by mid 2009 we only have about 10 months left
8439211 it seems more and more unlikely that these technical service contracts can be implemented now in such a short remaining time
8439212 we are working at increasing our production hopefully by another 500 000 bpd by the middle of next year
8439213 different parliamentary blocs still have serious differences about the law
8439214 i have not heard anything new from the parliament to make me expect that the law will be passed any time soon you

8439216 i sell a kilogram of gold every day that used to be my monthly average a year ago

8439218 in our rush to develop the country we are making mistakes
8439219 we stand for preservation and modernization going hand in hand
8439220 there is a danger that expanding the imam ali shrine and building more hotels could mean demolishing parts of the old city
8439221 we support the development of the city in the best possible way
8439222 but we want the work done in a way that respects the spirit of a city that hosts imam ali
8439223 there will be no giving up of the old towns heritage and landmarks
8439224 this is frustrating we want to win as many games as we possibly can
8439225 i can see why so many third base coaches send runners
8439226 i dont like this place i dont know what it is about this place but they play us tough
8439227 in my mind he was going to have to come over me to score that run
8439228 that was obviously a big play just to hold them off
8439229 that was huge im sure he feels wonderful i feel good for him
8439230 usually i pride myself that if we score some runs i dont give up the lead that wasnt the case today
8439231 im thankful the guys picked me up and picked the team up

8439240 when a home goes into a foreclosure owners still have a window of opportunity in which they can sell the home by selling rather than a foreclosure the effects arent so detrimental thats one of the reasons the site www investorsclassifieds com began to help frantic owners promote their property and sell quickly
8439241 simply put too many home buyers trusted their loan officers
8439242 sadly many buyers didnt known what they what they were getting into
8439243 they thought they were buying the american dream with a low introductory rate but in truth they made a deal with the devil now that their mortgages are starting the adjustable period rates are higher and at prices they can no longer afford
8439244 if youre going into foreclosure dont list your property with a realtor
8439245 many people make this mistake a realtor simply doesnt have the time to sell your home prior to foreclosure proceedings also understand that you wont get the full value for your property if you can come to terms with that then youll be much further ahead of the rest of the people in foreclosure
8439246 a home listed with a realtor is usually on the market for 60 days if not more before finding a potential qualified buyer from that point it can take three to four weeks for that buyer to get the financing and close on the property to make matters worse after all that sometimes the buyer might not qualify for the loan or they change their mind about buying in the end precious time is wasted
8439247 you need someone who knows how to deal with banks and who can save you from foreclosure you wont make as much as you would through a conventional market purchase but it can save you from the red mark of foreclosure
8439248 we offer sellers a wide range of options for sellers looking to sell their property free listing to 199 95 for a full year membership

8439250 we can buy many homes in the phoenix area usually within 24 hours or we work with the bank to help owners
8439251 another option is to take over payments and give owners some cash if they have equity in their home
8439252 i thought this year i would have seen an update
8439253 we do have to make it a little bit tougher for them in a couple of the accounts and we understand where those are and we will do a little bit better job competing in those
8439254 there might be very short gaps where somebody might have a feature or temporary advantage
8439255 i think over time youll see us continue to be the clear leader in routing in all categories
8439256 i think theyre overdue for products in this edge area
8439257 i have great respect for cisco and what theyve done globally in networking
8439258 we dont attempt to go after every customer cisco has we focus on accounts where high performance networking actually matters
8439259 the idea is that if things were going well for a party mps are cohesive they all agree with each other and stick together but if things are going badly for a party they start disagreeing and have different opinions so factions appear unsurprisingly the period following the election is marked by all three parties showing a considerable level of fluctuation in their cohesiveness as if in some disarray
8439260 the information gained from looking at early day motions can really provide an insight into many aspects of political life does your mp really agree with party principles or are they secretly more in tune one of the other parties what are the issues that are causing your party trouble and strife what is the overall mood of the party at any one point in time just before an important vote for example

8439320 the offer to chuck was that it was only to replace financial considerations he might lose during an election
8439321 this use of legal action to silence the opposition is characteristic of authoritarian governments
8439322 there was information gathered through either staff or inmates that there was an escape plan
8439323 but they couldnt determine what unit was involved which inmates whether it was from inside the unit or outside the prison on maybe an escort or something so they were just trying to glean some of that information
8439324 theres always information coming forth regarding escapes and they told me that they monitor the situation they do due diligence they investigate the actual tips that come in and the intelligence and then they digest it and go from there
8439325 in this case with no specifics they didnt feel it necessary to lock down the whole prison
8439326 the hole was big enough for a person to fit through thats pretty obvious
8439327 the ministry officials have told me they cant determine if they climbed over the fence or how they got out of the yard
8439328 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8439329 i didnt hear cunningham give any kind of order i didnt see him there i dont know where cunningham was when they were shot
8439330 i then realized it was too close and wondered what was going on there
8439331 i thought oh no as i put two and two together i was kind of in disbelief i thought no way i couldnt believe it
8439332 i just think he doesnt have the temperament to be president
8439333 do i have the ability to speak with experience about someone who has abused everyone hes dealt with
8439334 there isnt a republican serving in the senate thats happy hes the nominee now theyre all supporting him but ill tell you they have told me ive had republican senators tell me they dont think theyll vote for him
8439335 we wanted to do a fake documentary about the making of the movie within the movie which is called
8439336 there were some fine pieces of storytelling among the finalists and some characters it was interesting and enjoyable to spend time with i would particularly recommend noah and i didnt know i wasnt black to bookhabit readers what made matt fullertys writing stand out from the very first sentence was an unusually strong and individual way with words taking us into the vanished world of old america and europe he uses a highly textured language to give an almost physical experience of being in that place and time drawing subtle lines between a society top heavy with leisure and the profligate genius it produced in morphy he holds back the historical and personal reckoning while letting it gather and brood like the storm that finally washes away new orleans in my view this makes the pride and the sorrow a stand out all rounder in the craft of literary fiction
8439337 as a scholar of literature im especially interested in how these letters say things that cannot be said
8439338 how do they manage to talk about issues without talking about them how do they use the 19 th century language of sentiment to narrate dread and uncertainty in the face of unprecedented modern disaster
8439339 i am also interested in what the letters reveal about jews who desperately wanted emigrate but who were ironically frustrated in their attempts by the very nazi bureaucracies that had made life in germany unbearable
8439340 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8439341 its very clear that if he announces the new cabinet its a declaration of war against the people you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate
8439342 following the poor sporting results as well as the impact of toughening economic conditions since then the board now expects underlying operating profit for the year of approximately 75 million assuming a reasonable run of sporting results over the remainder of the year
8439343 the full year consensus expectation is for us to deliver something around mid double digit growth 14 to 15 and were on track to do that
8439344 international joint ventures are expected to sustain their improved first half performance
8439345 we expect this business to sustain its improved performance for the second half delivering an overall satisfactory performance for the year
8439346 however the airport intends to increase the cost from a 100 discount to an 80 discount
8439347 in fairness to the lads in cork they would happily do a deal with us but they are being told by the dublin airport authority you must increase the costs
8439348 as a result of that we are closing the two routes that means from the end of november cork will lose 100 000 passengers on those two routes alone in winter it will lose 200 000 over a full 12 month period and that will result in a drop in tourism revenues of 200 000 annually and that is the equivalent of 200 local jobs lost in the supporting areas
8439349 yet again cork airport is losing out due to a decision of dublin airport
8439350 at meetings with caa they have said if it was their decision they would simply extend the cost base but were being told by dublin and the boss of the daa declan collier no changes no discount no extension to the discount arrangement the rules that apply in dublin are simply being imposed on cork it is another extension of the way daa is run to discriminate against cork and shannon

8439364 but racial and gender bias are still very real and prevalent with nontrivial proportions of americans indicating explicitly in surveys that they are not prepared to vote for a black or woman candidate having a doubly unconventional ticket may be too much to ask of the current american electorate
8439365 the question of how you could manage a spouse who was also an ex president

8439380 he is more than any other contemporary political figure a creature of these times
8439381 i think the last eight years have destroyed 200 years of respect for this country i think the republican party is corrupt through and through they have been in office too long they are too adept at thievery and moving the constitution into places it was never meant to go i think they have an extraordinary ability to divide rather than unite

8439506 is it on your grandfathers or your grandmothers side that you claim descent from an ape
8439507 huxley denies having replied that he would rather be an ape than a bishop
8439508 when professors lose their tempers and solemnly avow they would rather be descended from apes than bishops
8439509 i asserted and i repeat that a man has no reason to be ashamed of having an ape for his grandfather if there were an ancestor whom i should feel shame in recalling it would rather be a man a man of restless and versatile intellect who not content with an equivocal success in his own sphere of activity plunges into scientific questions with which he has no real acquaintance only to obscure them by an aimless rhetoric and distract the attention of his hearers from the real point at issue by eloquent digressions and skilled appeals to religious prejudice
8439510 i cannot quite accept mr j r greens sentences as your fathers though i didnt doubt that they convey the sense
8439511 he was not ashamed to have a monkey for his ancestor but he would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used great gifts to obscure the truth
8439512 i should say that freemantles account is substantially correct but that green has the substance of my speech more accurately

8439516 we just wanted to give our institutions a heads up that our examiners will be focusing on how the institutions are handling cutbacks in home equity lines of credit
8439517 there are clearly rules that apply when an institution wants to suspend or reduce an equity line of credit
8439518 our goal in issuing the guidance was to bring all those rules together in one place

8439521 the simplest and biggest contribution anyone can make to leaving a habitable planet for our grandchildren

8439533 we dont attempt to go after every customer cisco has we focus on accounts where high performance networking actually matters
8439534 julie moult is an idiot but i just cant help but feel were going after the wrong person

8439537 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be

8439539 the grand old party is no longer grand it is just old
8439540 i see arrogance at home and incompetence at home and i simply cant tolerate and america cant afford four more years
8439541 we came so close to winning and this time we will
8439542 america can do better than that and barack obama will
8439543 lets send a message thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not a charm
8439544 in his first presidential decision his selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8439545 that campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8439546 last night hillary said shes going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8439547 clearly the job of te next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore american leadership in the world
8439548 i love this and i thank you im here first to support barack obama
8439549 and second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden
8439550 if the bush administration has proven anything its that length of service
8439551 obama and i opposed the iraq war from day one
8439552 we cant afford to be taken in by the politics of fear
8439553 we are so proud to stand with him as he leads the fight for stronger and tougher foreign policy it is time for barack obama
8439554 he provided the arguments for voting for obama that the delegates can use in coming weeks when voters ask them why they should especially since obama has little foreign policy experience they said the same about me said clinton and look how well i did
8439555 you have thus willfully violated the free history projects intellectual property rights
8439556 in this election we need a nominee who can pass the commander in chief test senator mccain will bring a time of experience to the campaign i will bring a lifetime of experience and senator obama will bring a speech he gave in 2002 i think that is a significant difference
8439557 he was questioned at the police station in sderot for entering the gaza strip in defiance of a military decree banning israeli citizens from doing so

8439560 hemos consolidado 25 a os en la laguna en una regi n con gran amenaza y adversidades de climas extremosos lo cual no es un impedimento para que la gente de ah luche por ser exitosa por tal motivo nos satisface mucho continuar con nuestro proyecto de proyecci n nacional territorio santos modelo en el que desde hace unos a os cuando grupo modelo retoma el club fue una de nuestras primeras intensiones para transmitirle a nuestro pa s educaci n y valores por medio del deporte
8439561 es importante dejar en claro que no ser una universidad de futbol sino una instituci n en la que vamos a desarrollar cinco carreas especializadas en el rea del deporte es decir que no ser que la educaci n se base en jugar s lo futbol este es un concepto diferente nuestra raz n es brindarle a la gente para que se desarrolle en valores como socialmente cultural y entretenimiento
8439562 claro hay muchas instituciones en las que nos hemos enfocado para tener ejemplos y pachuca es una de ellas obviamente nos acercamos a cada uno de ellos tanto del pa s y europa para tomar cosa positivas y cumplir con un gran proyecto
8439563 por ahora estamos en 25 por ciento de la obra despu s de dar inicio a la construcci n el 20 de abril del presente a o y tenemos considerado que para agosto de 2009 est el proyecto terminado en todas sus etapas y sobretodo listo para arrancar por lo pronto este viernes llevaremos a acabo la inauguraci n de nuestro primer centro de formaci n en c rdoba veracruz donde se tiene una estructura de m s de doscientos jugadores que tiene una tercera divisi n de ascenso que comenzar jugando como santos casino que es una asociaci n con el casino espa ol de c rdoba y con una direcci n deportiva de santos
8439564 obviamente nos gustar a culminar esta satisfacci n con otro t tulo pero debo reconocer que esta instituci n no lo vemos como objetivo porque los campeonatos son consecuencia de un gran trabajo y entrega total y para eso estamos mentalizados tenemos que seguir trabajando desde todas nuestras reas desde fuerzas b sicas
8439565 they pride themselves on being a new breed of news delivery
8439566 media organizations pay hundreds of thousands to millions for photos and video footage
8439567 people magazine notoriously paid over 10 million for brad pitt and angelina jolies baby photos
8439568 it looks like wikileaks is still looking for the optimal method to distribute its materials
8439569 i think it will automatically rule out publications like the new york times and others that might devote significant attention to an in depth look at such internal e mails but would not pay for them
8439570 whether u s media outlets are cheap or have ethics i dont know
8439571 the degree to which news organizations refuse to pay for the news is proportional to the degree to which they are able to bilk the public with unworthy alternatives
8439572 indeed for anyone who has been in the news business for a while knows manufacture of news is so arbitrary the result must be described primarily as mere entertainment
8439573 good for them we live in a capitalist country everything has a dollar value even ethical behavior so get over it lets see what is going on behind the scenes with hugo and the gang
8439574 han cumplido los jugadores ha cumplido el p blico que ha llenado el calder n y ha animado todo el partido y hemos cumplido nosotros todo el mundo ha cumplido
8439575 they are still attempting to see if anyone else assisted
8439576 es un jugador capaz de hacer de diez a 14 goles en una misma temporada
8439577 la intenci n es que sea una pieza importante para nosotros pero eso no lo tengo que decidir yo lo tendr que hacer l en el campo lo firmamos con esa condicionante ya que lleva un par de a os en los que no termina de rendir convenientemente porque no se ha adaptado pero en un pa s donde la lengua es la misma y el car cter tambi n esperamos que aqu sea su reivindicaci n y saque todo lo bueno que tiene porque adem s vendr a cedido con opci n a compra por lo tanto si se quiere quedar tendr que rendir

8439581 the student is under a doctors care this week and is not in school
8439582 this student does have the mrsa strand which is contagious and has been deadly before
8439583 our coaches always try to keep locker rooms clean but were taking precautions now
8439584 ante todo quiero felicitar al atl tico por su victoria de hoy ha sido una victoria merecida y el resultado ha sido muy claro
8439585 en la segunda mitad tuvimos posibilidades despu s del 2 0 tuvimos oportunidades pero ni hicimos gol y esa ha sido la diferencia y la clave del partido
8439586 no me ha gustado el resultado estoy decepcionado y a pesar de que el equipo haya avanzado en su juego no tengo motivos para estar contento
8439587 el atl tico es un gran equipo y est en disposici n de no recibir goles y de hacerlos porque tiene grandes delanteros
8439588 ha sido dura esta derrota tanto para nuestros seguidores como para el equipo va a ser dif cil superar este rev s eso est claro porque tenemos ahora dos d as para preparar el siguiente partido y superar esta adversidad
8439589 no puedo echar la culpa a los jugadores hemos jugado de forma ofensiva a partir del segundo gol y eso implica dejar m s espacios algo que el atl tico pudo aprovechar

8439591 its possible this mechanism in the liver is relevant to fibrotic situations in other tissues
8439592 once a lot of extracellular matrix has formed its very hard to clear
8439593 the material just sits there and creates an inflammatory environment
8439594 we suggest that following tissue damage hepatic stellate cells become activated and proliferate intensely senesce and are eventually cleared to protect the liver from an excessive fibrogenic response to acute injury

8439600 obviously were really excited we made charts and very appreciative to everyone that bought the record this first week but at same time its really hard to sell records with all the people downloading nowadays were really happy that people still went out and bought it did and we hope they enjoy it to the people that downloaded it we hope you come out to one the shows and at least sing along and have a good time
8439601 continent is basically my absolute disgust towards everything the whole album is based on the concept of nihilism the world as we know it was a fluke and there is no meaning in anything it is about pulling yourself out of society because everything makes you sick it is about purposefully leaving everything behind and destroying everything you think you love it is about hatred anger rage and resentment nothing is sure to me anymore everything has been tainted this album is pretty much exonerating myself from it all
8439602 the unearth tour is basically the support tour we have been waiting for
8439603 the lineup is one of the most diverse we have been a part of since

8439608 depression affects people regardless of their age gender cultures and social economic group depression is an illness that can affect anyone
8439609 whether youre famous or not what it just means is that the rest of us will hear about it it doesnt mean that theyre the only people who will experience it theyre all equally tragic
8439610 but it can be harder for famous people to seek help because of their high profiles
8439611 my thoughts and prays are with marks family and friends he will be sorely missed my many
8439612 bless you for giving us such enjoyment in watching you blossom in front of our eyes its a shame you arent with us anymore

8439620 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
8439621 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
8439622 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
8439623 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines

8439822 they were the best times i had in czw those were the guys i was hanging out with in japan and then i also got to work with them back home
8439823 im happy to see these matches are being re released and this era has not been forgotten
8439824 it is really hard to get your head around the fact that when your child goes on an excursion they need to have a permission slip signed by the parent but the school is within its rights to take a child to the doctor to be put on the pill
8439825 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me of whether you voted for barack the time is now to reunite as a single party with a single purpose
8439826 none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8439827 hillary couldnt have said it better none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is our one shot so lets roll up our sleeves
8439828 im here to support barack obama and secondly im here to warm you up for joe biden
8439829 people all over the world have been more impressed by the power of our example than the example of our power
8439830 we do know what a bush mccain administration would look like
8439831 the united states does not torture not now not ever
8439832 before he agrees to debate barack obama he should end the debate with himself
8439833 hes given 7 of the 10 worst speeches ive ever heard in my life
8439834 when you see the abuse of power youve got to speak
8439835 be there for my dad as he was for me be there for barack obama because the country needs him
8439836 john mccain has been wrong and barack obama has been right
8439837 with market conditions likely to remain volatile for the rest of this year delivering growth in the short term will continue to be challenging but we remain confident in the medium to long term outlook for the wealth management industry chief executive craig dunn who started in the position on january 1 said
8439838 while amp will prudently manage through these market conditions we will also continue to invest where we see potential growth opportunities that position us well over the medium to long term mr dunn said
8439839 m amp a can be legitimate but it would have to be strategically relevant he said
8439840 we expect margins to contract by 2 to 3 per cent per annum over the longer term because of the competitive market in which we operate he said
8439841 our capital strategy is aimed at enhancing this already strong position in the current climate increasing business flexibility to grow and further optimising our capital mix mr dunn said
8439842 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
8439843 following a secondary screening she was found to be in possession of what appeared to be cocaine and heroin
8439844 those of us who have served with sen mccain know that he would do anything to try to win
8439845 i think that they like his wearing his religion on his sleeve
8439846 apparently they love his flip flopping he was for abortion hes against it hes for gay marriage hes against it hes for global warming hes against it
8439847 harry reids attacks on john mccain fall somewhere between desperate and pathetic reflecting the type of passive aggressive weak leadership that earned congress a 19 percent approval rating
8439848 because john kerry wanted to be nice he didnt want to say anything bad about the president thats ridiculous
8439849 i said that at the time i still feel that way its like going into a fight and saying ill fight you but ill only use one hand
8439850 at this stage we have not fought with two hands and as of last saturday it changed
8439851 i think theyve done a great job of connecting mccains viewpoints and perspectives to that of the bush administration
8439852 i think they need to just keep the focus on mccain now so its not so much the legacy of bush its what mccains perspective and policies are
8439853 its terribly sad i am a fan of the show myself

8439868 masaharu morimoto has done more to expose america to japanese cooking than perhaps any other chef in the last decade and we are eager to give him a platform in americas biggest city to celebrate his accomplishments and open a few more hearts minds and bellies to japanese cuisine
8439869 in preseason they have to play and get ready to go but you just kind of hold your breath all the time last week there were some really good players that got hurt around the nfl and you just hope it doesnt happen to you
8439870 oh i was surprised i didnt know what was going on
8439871 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8439872 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8439873 we dont need anything of this magnitude to come here
8439874 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8439875 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8439876 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf
8439877 the buy in amounts are fairly minimal so it is worth their while if they have losses on their farms this year to get into fsa and determine if they should do this buy in
8439878 you are talking about a major pinch for every cent that gasoline goes up it is costing the american publc a billion dollars so we are very concerned about where this is headed
8439879 affliction is proud to make racing history as the first mma organization to sponsor a car in nascar
8439880 nascar fans are huge supporters of mma and this is a great collaboration for both sports
8439881 its great to have affliction entertainment as a michael waltrip racing partner
8439882 our partnership with affliction and mma allows us to connect with millions of fans in a unique way
8439883 myron schulz chadron state is a very good football team
8439884 i think that she went a long way towards uniting the party i think a lot of this sort of disunity story that is out there is i think it is a very small minority of people who i dont think represent the vast majority of the parties of hillarys delegates and supporters
8439885 joe biden gives a fiery speech and that is my predicton and i think you should expect that he is going to give a great inspiration speech that is going to fire up the troops and president clinton you know i dont know if anyone can question if he is a inspirational speaker i look forward to what he has to say
8439886 we expect to see that kind of thing in myanmar not on the streets of denver
8439887 i cannot teach anybody anything i can only make them think
8439888 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8439889 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8439890 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8439891 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8439892 there are snobs everywhere in all companies from morning till night from youth to the grave being by nature endowed with snobbishness and others who are snobs only in certain circumstances and relations of life
8439893 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
8439894 the roads in new zealand have a good rhythm and they are so smooth that theres no need to worry about damaging the car on rocks
8439895 its important to win rallies for our title challenges but if i cant do that then i have to score as many points as possible
8439896 i have always enjoyed this rally ever since i first came here in 2002 the lush green backdrop to the stages is magnificent
8439897 the stages are fast and technically demanding but the cars dont suffer its certainly one of my favourite events
8439898 its a long way to get there but i love the new zealand stages and also the country itself
8439899 hopefully i can play even better in the next round
8439900 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8439901 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8439902 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8439903 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8439904 we now have the widest gap we have ever had between republicans and democrats
8439905 its the most powerful predictor of party id and partisan voting intention
8439906 and in a society that values religion as much as this one when there are high levels of religious belief and commitment and practice thats significant
8439907 america is great because she is good and if america ever ceases to be good america will cease to be great
8439908 our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other
8439909 the notion that it is improper to look beyond the borders of the united states in grappling with hard questions has a certain kinship to the view that the u s constitution is a document essentially frozen in time as of the date of its ratification
8439910 appeals to a common sense of what judges roles ought to be in a properly functioning constitutional democracy judges are not to overturn the will of the legislative majorities absent a violation of a constitutional right as those rights were understood by the framers
8439911 to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions is a very dangerous doctrine indeed and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy
8439912 i had someone ask me in this process i dont remember who it was but somebody asked me you know are you going to be on the side of the little guy and you obviously want to give an immediate answer but as you reflect on it if the constitution says that the little guy should win the little guy is going to win in court before me but if the constitution says that the big guy should win well then the big guy is going to win because my obligation is to the constitution thats the oath
8439913 the american people will never be able to regain democratic self government and thus shape public policy until we curb activist judges
8439914 someday youre going to get a very conservative supreme court and regret that approach

8439917 we had a few police officers on the 19 man trek
8439918 one was taking and photos with a large lens of the trees and flowers
8439919 he then discovered what looks like the remains of a body
8439920 it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman
8439921 it is good to have an ace up one s sleeve an ace like a piq
8439922 some point during this campaign maybe during one of the debates when obama has to look into the camera and say to america im black
8439923 tell me what democracy looks like this is what democracy looks like
8439924 i just cant imagine driving through my neighborhood at home and seeing a security checkpoint
8439925 its pretty neat we can still do this in this country
8439926 you already paid for them when you bought world of warcraft
8439927 this was why god put the ticket in his hands
8439928 the turnout at the events continues to grow and the number of messages streaming in has been incredible
8439929 wiffiti allows the audience to stay actively involved in the discussion throughout the forums which puts our social media message into practice in a timely engaging way
8439930 the face of politics has changed dramatically throughout this election and emerging media technologies have clearly taken center stage
8439931 the outburst forum at the dnc gave us a chance to showcase wiffitis capabilities for sparking intense debates that extend far beyond the venue itself the forum panelists did an amazing job at propelling the digital conversation forward while still giving the audience control of the dialogue its so rewarding for us to see wiffiti used in this way
8439932 were fortunate to be involved in both the dnc and the rnc the democrats have gotten the majority of the buzz for employing emerging media in their campaigns so were proud to be opening up the social media dialogue to both parties
8439933 we lifted the head to make the pony more proud tipped the neck into the wind to give it a feeling of greater speed and better balance
8439934 its more chiseled and more defined and looks more like a wild horse
8439935 its more realistic in terms of proportion to an actual mustang
8439936 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber
8439937 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so
8439938 sciencedaily aug 27 2008 misinterpreted fragments of leg bones teeth and brow ridges found in palau appear to be an archaeologists undoing according to researchers at three institutions they say that the so called dwarfs of these micronesian islands actually were modern normal sized hunters and gatherers
8439939 justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream
8439940 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character
8439941 i have a dream that one day every valley shall be engulfed every hill shall be exalted and every mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together
8439942 words are simply not enough at a time like this
8439943 this was an absolutely fundamental charge which if it were true would mean we had behaved in the most disgraceful way and i would have to resign as prime minister
8439944 went to the heart of the office of prime minister
8439945 i think the basic view would have been not to offer the name but on the other hand not to mislead people
8439946 this strategy provides a bold vision and concrete actions to help new zealanders become leaders in the digital world
8439947 revolutionary change has occurred since the 2005 digital strategy robust competition is driving a wave of investment to build super fast broadband networks
8439948 no country has more to gain from this digital revolution than new zealand through it we overcome our remoteness leverage our inventiveness and show off our uniqueness
8439949 the building blocks of the digital strategy remain relevant super fast connection enhanced user confidence and cool content ds 2 0 sets out targets and actions that take these to the next level and emphasises the importance of collaboration to get there
8439950 ds 2 0 challenges us to go further to secure outcomes from this technology new digital productivity reduced environmental footprints and communities that are locally networked and globally connected
8439951 to do this we are introducing a number of exciting new projects such as connected new zealand and the digital content innovation cluster were also expanding successful initiatives such as videoconferencing and teleworking the aotearoa peoples network and the community partnership fund
8439952 the digital strategy is about people and their ability to connect to the world its about bringing all new zealanders on the journey by breaking down the digital divide and building their capability and confidence in using ict the future belongs to us all
8439953 new zealanders are leaders in the digital world we live in a prosperous sustainable and vibrant society
8439954 we tried to break into the planes doors and then tried to break it in half by pulling at the tail
8439955 but it was no good we had to go back because of the heat
8439956 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8439957 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8439958 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8439959 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8439960 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8439961 cityengine is a powerful tool for modeling entire cities in perfect detail
8439962 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8439963 theres no doubt in my mind that we will prevail and theres no doubt in my mind once these people are gone that we will be welcomed as liberators
8439964 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
8439965 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8439966 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
8439967 i am honored to be here tonight a proud mother a proud democrat a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8439968 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8439969 new zealand is facing a serious economic challenge generated by the global credit crunch and steep rises in global commodity prices
8439970 these are the most complex and challenging set of economic forces we have confronted in at least two decades
8439971 there is no other dog that can compare to a corgi
8439972 doled out tens of thousands of dollars to charities among them jeremiah wrights trinity united church of christ obamas church and the arab american action network
8439973 gerrard has a groin problem so he will have an operation and could be out for 10 to 15 days
8439974 its not serious but we need to do it he has been playing some games in pain not being 100 percent fit
8439975 he had a problem for the first leg with liege and when he went away with england for the friendly last week against the czech republic
8439976 we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain but now we will have to get the situation solved
8439977 i feel like its all my fault that nobody can play
8439978 i dont switch positions and i dont make promises that cant be kept
8439979 children and families living in areas already experiencing relative deprivation therefore face further inequity because they have less access to high quality childcare provision
8439980 unison is campaigning for major expansion of childcare provision we need quality care delivered by properly trained and fairly paid childcare workers
8439981 this should be a wake up call to government to improve standards and provide training for people working with children in this sector
8439982 even one childminder providing poor care is one too many
8439983 disadvantaged children have much to gain from receiving high quality childcare and every effort should be made to improve quality
8439984 his motor never stops and when you say go play relentless for the gators he understands that about as good as anybody
8439985 the short time he has practiced he has really really left a strong impression on everybody
8439986 its still too early to tell exactly what its going to do
8439987 if a tree comes through the roof and buries them underneath there theyre going to be on their own
8439988 the citizens should not be worried about the flooding again
8439989 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8439990 theres no way a parent today can compare like schools with like schools
8439991 theres nothing available to the national government today that enables us to see across the nation on a comparable system which schools are falling behind and need extra resources
8439992 we want transparency and we are prepared to bring new and extra resources to the table to make a difference to disadvantaged schools and to make a difference on teacher quality
8439993 theres no point in the world with comparing a rich school on sydneys north shore with elizabeth north in south australia and how the school is going there
8439994 our whole plan is to analyse student population and compare like schools with like schools
8439995 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations
8439996 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8439997 were not only going to take the best practice there were going to take extra resources there
8439998 were pledging a school like that with difficulties would get resources of 500 000 a year extra to make a difference and to bring that school up to standard
8439999 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
