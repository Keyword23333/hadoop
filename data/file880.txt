8800003 that i would never lose another match because im not fit i could lose because i played bad or the other girl played awesome but never because i couldnt chase down another ball
8800004 i went home that night and thought either i quit tennis or i go through with this because this is what i need to do just to go back there for the next few days was a mentally tough choice 70 per cent of jays clients quit before they complete the training the main focus is learning to take and hold a certain position at 100 per cent maximum stretch for minutes at a time because you tend to get injured mostly when you suddenly have to go 100 per cent and youre not ready for it i was pretty proud to make it through
8800005 i couldnt keep the ball in the court it was so weird it took me a couple of practices to get back on track but when it came to moving i felt awesome

8800011 we are pleased with this significant and extremely positive development for our company
8800012 we have been anticipating the rems request and have been proactively evaluating a series of options that will enable us to mitigate any delay in approval all other aspects of our onsolis nda were reviewed positively and with no deficiencies noted i want to congratulate the entire team at bdsi for this tremendous accomplishment
8800013 we believe that fda approval of onsolis and its u s commercial launch should add considerable value to bdsi based on the aggregate 30 million in approval and launch milestone payments sales based milestone payments and double digit royalty on sales which provide the means to accelerate development of our pipeline in addition the outcome of the onsolis nda review validates the bema drug delivery platform and should immediately enhance the value of other bema products in development particularly bema buprenorphine our second pain product we believe that the future of bdsi continues to be very promising
8800014 we have been working over the last several months with meda ab our partner for the commercialization of onsolis to prepare for a potential rems requirement these activities have put us in a position to respond rapidly to fdas request depending on fda review time approval could occur as early as the first quarter or as late as second quarter of 2009
8800015 with respect to our financial position we have managed our cash prudently over the course of 2008 and have a few months of cash in reserve
8800016 we have a financial plan that includes several choices to bridge the gap to approval and the receipt of milestone payments from meda totaling 30 million importantly we will seek to only raise the capital required to reach the anticipated approval with little or no dilution to our stockholders it should be noted that the costs associated with finalization and implementation of the rems for onsolis will be the responsibility of meda

8800050 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives

8800052 barack obamas speech tonight laid out his specific bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future
8800053 his speech crystallized the clear choice between he and senator mccain four more years of the same failed policies or a leader who can tackle the great challenges we face revitalizing our economy and restoring our standing in the world i am proud to support senator obama our next president of the united states and joe biden our next vice president of the united states

8800056 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president

8800061 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8800062 while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8800063 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8800064 yes we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair but we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
8800065 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office

8800068 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8800069 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change

8800088 there are very limited entry locations into the train station i was going to meet a friend at the train station entrance the line was so long there that people were getting back on the light rail train just to get to the end of the line instead of trying to walk so far

8800101 it is vital that these and other states stand their ground

8800120 the two areas are within the internationally recognized borders of georgia and they must remain so
8800121 we use the same arguments as those used by the west with regard to kosovo all other possible means were exhausted there was no possible way to reconcile with georgia this is purely a continuation of the kosovo precedent of course some western leaders will say that there is no link between kosovo and abkhazia and south ossetia but what can they say without contradicting themselves about what they said regarding kosovo

8800160 we have not received instructions as to what to say you should call the command center we are waiting to receive the specifics from them

8800162 they the police didnt carry any weapons now there are 500 armed chinese troops searching house to house in the area it has been almost nine hours but we still havent found anyone

8800175 we do see more foreign fighters now though i think coming to pakistan and operating in afghanistan than were seeing in iraq no intelligence agency would say this but it may be that theres been a refocus i think the al qaida knows that they have blown a movement in iraq through a number of missteps over time
8800176 the influence and the presence and the numbers of al qaida in iraq are very much diminished and they had to go somewhere and my guess is my belief is that they probably have gone to that safe haven in the fata
8800177 thats long been an ungoverned area i think were all concerned that if its not managed and it must be managed by the pakistanis its on their side of the border if its not managed that you could see attacks against other parts of pakistan and certainly attacks into afghanistan
8800178 pakistan is a hard nut to crack and its probably not one that we coalition forces are going to be able to solve

8800212 after all the last general election gave us a strong victory we are only eight seats short of a two thirds majority it is not that we lost by 20 or 30 seats only eight seats we have a very strong government

8800233 when dorel bought cannondale we made it very clear and have taken great pains to ensure people got the message that dorel is only going to do the right things when it comes to the cannondale brand thats why we set up the cannondale sports group
8800234 the two operations are completely separate because jeff was the president of pacific his roots are there thats understandable there was a required relocation and after consultation with his family the final decision was not to relocate and he handed in his resignation
8800235 theres a fantastic executive team in place they wont miss a beat with or without me
8800236 something similar happened at specialized a few years back when there were a lot of people coming and going and now its a strong company when companies get bought this kind of thing happens so we will have to wait and see
8800237 i dont think it will impact cannondale that much they have really impressive product right now
8800238 i think you have to take the time to get the right person we dont want to put a clock on it its not a panic business has never been better for the division were going to keep doing what were doing
8800239 i really have no idea but i love this industry its in the blood i guess
8800240 if we do not change course in iraq soon youre going to see two years from now helicopters hovering over our embassy in the green zone in baghdad with people hanging
8800241 my sense is that we have achieved tactical momentum and wrested the initiative from our enemies in a number areas of iraq we are in short a long way from the goal line but we do have the ball and we are driving down the field
8800242 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
8800243 unless you become like one of these children you shall not enter the kingdom of god
8800244 do you just want to stay in the car and i can just run in real fast

8800250 love from a pure heart sincere faith and a clear conscience
8800251 not about the list for the day but enjoying each moment
8800252 are these the same kids we have at home who sometimes seem unwilling to do the simplest of task

8800254 masters of the art a fighting marines view of viet nam
8800255 we need a president who will put barney smith before smith barney
8800256 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8800257 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8800258 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8800259 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8800260 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8800261 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8800262 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8800263 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8800264 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8800265 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8800266 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8800267 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8800268 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8800269 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8800270 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8800271 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8800272 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8800273 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8800274 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8800275 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8800276 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8800277 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8800278 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8800279 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8800280 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8800281 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8800282 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8800283 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8800284 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8800285 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8800286 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8800287 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8800288 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8800289 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8800290 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8800291 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8800292 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8800293 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8800294 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8800295 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8800296 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8800297 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8800298 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8800299 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8800300 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8800301 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8800302 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8800303 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8800304 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8800305 theres no one ready willing and able to look after them
8800306 she was crying wouldnt stop crying so they took her over to my mothers checked her over and rushed her right to the hospital
8800307 they need to get the person who did it it could happen to someone else in this time that he is out
8800308 they think who did this is hiding out right now
8800309 we hope to have enough officers out there so that people will definitley see a police presence
8800310 were teaming up with utah highway patrol also isp region 6 in idaho falls so were trying to put as many troopers on the road as we can
8800311 well watch for tailgating speeding unsafe lane changes all the things that can cause a crash is what were trying to avoid
8800312 i know when i personally pass a police officer i tend to look at my speed make sure im obeying all traffic laws and thats what were hoping to accomplish we want the motoring public to arrive at their destination safely
8800313 we looked at a map stuck a finger in there and just picked it and said thats ok and i came up here in july and went to yellowstone and came over here and just kinda scouted it out
8800314 well maybe we wont eat as normally as we wouldve
8800315 probably end up going fishing and spending some time at the park maybe going down to the greenbelt and its pretty cheap it doesnt cost much and you can still have fun here in idaho falls do whatever you need to do
8800316 its a great time to be here in idaho falls with the beautiful weather weve go the pool and the hot tub and people are just out enjoying themselves
8800317 i walked into my room to see if the baby was in my room and i didnt see her but i could here her crying it was a really bad cry through the floor
8800318 i knew then something was wrong theres a big old goose egg and i said mother we need to take her to the hospital some things wrong
8800319 they need to get the person who did it it could happen to someone else in this time that he is out
8800320 they think who did this is hiding out right now
8800321 im glad that her kids got taken away its not a good thing for our family and i hope they stay somewhere here but it will be better for them in the long run
8800322 i want my grand kids with me its just unbelievable that somebody could do this to a child
8800323 ive just learned a lot from working here and just got to deal with some wonderful people
8800324 i have had great experiences and its been a really rewarding job
8800325 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8800326 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8800327 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8800328 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8800329 i think the last eight years have been an utter disaster not only for america but for the world
8800330 zoom airlines had 3 flights to vancouver from europe arriving in the early afternoon they would have been turning around into 3 outbound flights later in the afternoon we understand the planes are being held at various other airports and they will not be arriving in vancouver
8800331 my sympathies go out because everyone wants to end with their destination they were supposed to take them to and people are waiting
8800332 i guess if im flying international i tend not to go for the cheaper ones i tend to go for the more reliable ones especially for international travels
8800333 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8800334 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8800335 obamas campaign has launched similar offensives against stations that have run campaign ads that it did not like
8800336 now of course to judge convention speeches i always turn to bill kristol monday night he said this about michelle obamas speech
8800337 and as for senator clintons praise for barack obama heres how kriristol described that
8800338 dont be mean to me tonight barack i was nice to you this time
8800339 you were a founding member of the project for the new american century so hows the century going so far
8800340 it must have been a solar powered jet or something because im sure they wouldnt have just wasted hundreds of gallons of fuel at this the greenest convention ever
8800341 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8800342 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8800343 im going for maximum death and destruction in the work place

8800345 antisemitism in nazi germany was difficult especially for the jews
8800346 beowulf is an anonymous medieval poem written in the 18th century by robert cotton
8800347 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced

8800350 it seems to make an impression on people because everyone seems to remember it and talk to me about it
8800351 the game was on tv but we had to delay the start of it while the custodial staff cleaned things up
8800352 when the team is doing well there are easily 100 or more people up there
8800353 we had a coach try to climb the fence once to get at us
8800354 weve toned it down over the years but when we play north allegheny we still bring a stuffed tiger every time we score we cut off a part of the tiger and throw it onto the field
8800355 i have season tickets to steelers games but to be honest id rather go to a high school game
8800356 my wife gets on me sometimes and says why do you go to high school games
8800357 i handle soccer too since 1973 ive been to every football game home and away except two
8800358 thank god i have my health and can still do everything i did when i was 50
8800359 plus i love this game and just love being with these kids
8800360 ive been on kidney dialysis for three years but this is the first year its really beating me up
8800361 im going to give this announcing a shot again though because i just like doing it i dont want to say that i cant do it any more because then i might just sit here and die doing these games takes your mind off a whole lot of problems you have
8800362 you might find some similar things down south at the traditional black colleges and universities really were a dancing band with high energy almost aerobic one of the steps we still use today is the charleston
8800363 when i was in the band here there was always a close relationship with the football team
8800364 its getting that way again after every game now win or lose the team comes over to the band and sings the alma mater as the band plays it
8800365 when this was run by nauticom years ago we tried to take this concept to ohio florida and texas
8800366 but its different like in florida there are not a lot of radio stations that broadcast high school games a ton of people go to games but not many games are on radio thats what makes this neck of the woods special
8800367 i think you do have to like high school sports to do this i guess i just found my niche
8800368 a century and a half ago when america faced our greatest trial the end of one era gave way to the birth of another the candidate who emerged victorious in that election is now regarded by most historians as our greatest president before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress during which he showed the courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country that was popular when it started but later condemned by history
8800369 in der einen hand die bibel in der anderen der colt
8800370 no matter if you are republican or democrat black or white this is history man we have a chance to put aside some things that have been separating us for a long time
8800371 i think my children should be a part of this historical moment
8800372 what does it say about your judgment when you vote with george bush 90 of the time
8800373 i dont think john mccain doesnt care about the problems of normal americans i just dont think he knows what they are
8800374 i dont know what john mccain thinks about the lives that celebrities lead
8800375 talking about oil for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8800376 a big election about small things this election has never been about me it is about you
8800377 we cannot turn back not with so much to be done
8800378 do i add filtered drinking water to this to make it a gallon

8800393 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8800394 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8800395 hes a great speaker but the fact is hes setting the public up for a huge let down should he become president
8800396 if the republicans had long ago accepted the existence of reality she wouldnt be coming back to bite them in the ass now
8800397 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done

8800399 i think his proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer

8800403 i question whether cindy is someone id want to see in the white house as first lady
8800404 i think his proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer
8800405 she never has and i doubt that she ever will
8800406 i wouldnt vote for john mccain if he was a democrat
8800407 i would not vote at all before id vote for him
8800408 i question whether cindy is someone id want to see in the white house as first lady

8800410 judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8800411 judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8800412 while john mccain was rotting in a prison camp in hanoi barack obama was lounging in front of a tv set watching the brady bunch in hawaii
8800413 you must take ownership of the last 8 years and now your future
8800414 you must take ownership of the last 8 years and now your future
8800415 you must take ownership of the last 8 years and now your future
8800416 its time we had a president who put barney smith ahead of smith barney
8800417 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
8800418 there is no better example than the climate crisis as i have said for many years throughout this land were borrowing money from china to restore americas greatness fight for smarter government that trusts the market but protects us against its excesses enact policies that are pro education and pro family establish a foreign policy that is smart as well as strong provide health care for all and solutions for the climate crisis
8800419 a century and a half ago when america faced our greatest trial the end of one era gave way to the birth of another the candidate who emerged victorious in that election is now regarded by most historians as our greatest president before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress during which he showed the courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country that was popular when it started but later condemned by history
8800420 shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8800421 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8800422 thats why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8800423 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8800424 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8800425 if mccain is a cock you must vote for barack
8800426 but i did stay at a holiday inn express last night

8800432 congress has been complaining about our oil addiction for 30 years and mccain has been there for 26
8800433 i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8800434 9 11 sadam hussain was a bad man fight them there so we dont fight them here tax cuts tax cuts tax cuts baby jesus i was a pow

8800442 greater stability in principal value than that of long term bonds
8800443 especially when i bought in my broker was telling me exactly what is in print
8800444 suggesting a bond fund instead of a cd is not necessarily a bad thing as long as you explain the risks
8800445 its not that you have to tell everything but you should give people a realistic expectation
8800446 it is unreasonable to expect an investor to read all of the pages of a prospectus and fully understand and interpret the disclosures thats why investors look to marketing material
8800447 looking for a way to earn better yields on your long term cash without taking on significantly higher risk

8800461 what the farmers want is for the present administration to continue efforts that has been initiated by former governor benjamin loong the former purchased more than twenty farm tractors to help uplift the socio economic development of farmers in the province
8800462 but without the interest and support of the present governor many if not all of these brand new tractors have been left out in the fields to rot
8800463 farmers cannot afford to sustain the maintenance and diesel to run the tractors and plow their fields
8800464 you know this is a very good opportunity for me and the comelec to cleanse the voters list in sulu

8800473 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8800474 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8800475 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8800476 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8800477 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of senator obama
8800478 the fact remains obama is still not ready to be president
8800479 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8800480 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8800481 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8800482 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but it is not the change america needs
8800483 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8800484 a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division
8800485 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8800486 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8800487 according to the scout ranger unit they confirmed that cpl sabangan boarded the aircraft
8800488 based on all these pieces of evidence and material that we have gathered so far in the last few days
8800489 that is ruthless reckless brainless and heartless and i will describe him or her as a wild animal
8800490 it is not true and i will fight for the last airman and the last pilot surviving in the air force i will not allow any pilot i will not allow any crew to fly an aircraft in our inventory because it is a flying coffin

8800508 most important thing we can do for winston salem is to continue to grow this company and create more jobs
8800509 the idea that a citizens property can be taken by the government solely for private use is extremely misguided in fact its just plain wrong
8800510 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

8800520 i cant change him but what can i do to change myself or my actions to make this a better situation
8800521 ive suggested we separate but he feels it is better to i guess stick it out and try to change me
8800522 im tired of feeling like a bad person who has to defend why i believe what i believe all the time
8800523 im tired of being told i am hurting him that i am all of these bad things just by being who i am
8800524 ive suggested we separate and that i would love for him to find someone who makes him happy and shares his beliefs
8800525 i cant change him but what can i do to change myself or my actions to make this a better situation
8800526 oh dear weve grown apart around something thats incredibly important to me is it possible for us to negotiate a way to manage this as a couple or do we need to end things
8800527 oh im just going to take up smoking for a few months

8800529 when we started we thought this was a way to make money and support the things we believed in
8800530 younger investors are much more likely to look at socially responsible investing not just as a niche strategy but also as a bedrock principle which puts pressure on 401 k providers and others to offer socially screened investments
8800531 i looked at it and thought heres something thats going to get rid of all the gas
8800532 if youve got talent youve got talent and i absolutely loved it
8800533 ang kapal ng mukha mo ha bakit ngayon ganyan ka porket maraming nanonood ngayon mabait ka kanina tinatarantado mo ako palibhasa walang nakakarinig sayo
8800534 tinanong ko kung staff siya taga processing daw siya nagulat ako bakit ganun ang reaction niya sa akin kahit payat at maliit ako hindi ako papayag apihin cavite a ako lalaban ako walang nang aapi sa akin
8800535 porket maraming nanonood ngayon mabait ka kanina tinatarantado mo ako palibhasa walang nakakarinig sayo
8800536 ang importante sa akin hindi ako nag power trip okey lang siraan at pintasan nila ako tanggap ko lahat na kaparte ng trabaho ko ito dapat masanay na ako dahil lahat na lang ng kilos ko tinatanong ko lang ang manager ko popoy caritativo kung bakit ayaw akong tantanan ganun din ang sinasabi niya na bahagi ito ng showbiz at kailangan kong masanay
8800537 japan r and d is working as quickly as possible to develop the vsc to work with our engines
8800538 good one honda when youre onto a good thing stick to it
8800539 but its still just not quite 100 percent we dont feel comfortable pitching him unless he is 100 percent because we have to take his long term interests and the teams long term interests into account first and foremost so again mainly for his peace of mind as much as anything else hes going to go see dr andrews on friday
8800540 we dont want to put any pitcher in a position where he has to take the mound at anything less than 100 percent
8800541 so we think this is the right move we had him penciled in i think you could tell from our answers to you guys the last couple of days we thought this might be a possibility its the right thing to do
8800542 i think scary is probably a good word for it ive had some sleepless nights thinking about all kinds of stuff you generally think the worst
8800543 were always concerned for all of our pitchers when theyre less than 100 percent but were pretty optimistic this things getting better
8800544 it just makes sense josh has a great relationship with andrews hes an accomplished doctor get another opinion here hope he comes back and can take the ball pretty soon
8800545 were trying to figure out whats causing it and go from there
8800546 right now its just day to day and im dealing with it we have a great medical staff were trying to be cautious were not talking about just the end of a season but about the end of a career some organizations would do anything they could to get a player back out there i appreciate what they are doing for me here
8800547 hes one of our horses and a guy that we count on for a lot of innings but hes got to take care of his body if his bodys telling him i cant pitch then he cant pitch were going to do our best to pick up his slack
8800548 unless we get out of these sanctions its going to cost the government of guam an large amount where instead of the federal government taking care of our administrative costs were going to have to pick up the bill so we dont want to see that happen
8800549 john from dodge city shared this pat roberts is an asshole
8800550 the e mail was in no way a reflection on julie merz jim slattery the jim slattery for senate campaign or even my personal views
8800551 technical issues on the part of our software vendor are no excuse for my behavior and i take full responsibility and ask for your forgiveness in this matter
8800552 these e mails get more pathetic as they go on this was not a malfunction a person directed by jim slattery wrote these words deliberately now they are upset because they got caught
8800553 he could have stepped up to the plate personally like a statesman and taken responsibility for his staff and the climate of name calling and childishness he has fostered instead he and his team chose to throw a junior staffer under the bus and hoped no one would notice
8800554 we are out of motorcycle tags and we dont know when well get more
8800555 weve gone through 50 of them in the past two weeks weve begged and borrowed from other counties but we cant get more the state says they will send us more but i cant give you an answer on when well get them
8800556 we have staff monitoring the situation throughout the holiday weekend
8800557 why spend the money to replace wide sidewalks in relatively good condition when so many others in the city are in much worse shape or simply dont exist schallberg asks
8800558 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
8800559 im living in mortal fear this speech will end i want it to go on and on and on
8800560 all this is doing is facilitating in the development process
8800561 the consultation process that weve had to date is minimal
8800562 what were seeing now is a thumbnail sketch of the developers plans
8800563 and our passing of the 13 recommendations is not approval but simply encouragement for the developer to continue
8800564 its had a nice push along and considered to have merit but there is still much more consultation to go through
8800565 all authorities have to be consulted before any complete approval will be made
8800566 port augusta in the past has been a leader in fuel prices but is behind at the moment
8800567 plus transport cost and profit margin there is no way the price should be what it is in port augusta
8800568 if you see it as even two or three steps forward its good
8800569 part of the problem we have now is that seaview was designed for 20 years but its been there 30
8800570 the architect was really professional the staff were listened to
8800571 its a question of things like the toilet having concrete floor or a tiled floor
8800572 get to the front of the store before i kill someone
8800573 one or two pieces of art sticking in the front yard of the juvenile services complex
8800574 i think we need to see how the program works before we change it
8800575 but in tough economic times we need a better understanding of how the dollars are spent
8800576 i thought i could do something better i was trying to show off
8800577 these guys want to try a little more of everything
8800578 if you have a mobility impairment gravity is your enemy water skiing is a totally different experience
8800579 what theyre looking to do is to get back to where they were
8800580 that transaction was done because i was asked to tender it and they gave me a deadline
8800581 well i work for the board first of all let me qualify that the board is my bosses up there i also have a chairman of the board but if its all right i met with two members of the board and if i could request id rather at this point in time not indicate the names of the members i hope you respect that but i was asked by two members of the board
8800582 i dont want it to appear that we were trying to hide or mislead anybody on it
8800583 i want to commend these men for making our communities safer for families
8800584 ive been a cop 18 years and ive never seen anything like the courage he displayed on that day
8800585 she was begging me not to let go saying she didnt have any strength left
8800586 i was just at the right place at the right time and doing my job
8800587 one of them hit me in the back of the head one grabbed my arm i turned around with my skateboard and one hit me in my mouth and one hit me right here
8800588 could infer from the circumstances that the perpetrators intended to inflict permanent injury they intended to assault
8800589 i see more money coming into the system and i see it coming in a more obvious and direct manner
8800590 we hope to go back to a system where people will send money directly to candidates
8800591 youll be able to track that and if contributions are not going directly to candidates youll have to question the motives
8800592 it just doesnt make sense that you can give more money to a state representative than you can to a candidate for president
8800593 we voted against the bill but it is now the law and we will follow the law
8800594 in terms of political parties in missouri the republicans are probably the winners
8800595 they seem to have more access to people with money
8800596 i think particularly in terms of legislative races the old limits will be de facto limits for many donors
8800597 it just happened so suddenly that we still think hes going to come to work
8800598 progress has started to pick up the pace as the iraqis are getting more control of areas and giving more responsibility to the police
8800599 i hope that as we go along in the next year that we cede more control to the iraqis
8800600 thats exciting thats what the international community wants to see happen
8800601 all the evidence is that it worked not everyone wants to declare an open victory but you like to think that the strategy worked
8800602 to be polite be professional but be prepared to kill
8800603 there is always concern and uncertainty on behalf of the families you never can ignore that
8800604 no matter how many times their soldier has gone overseas theres some uncertainty
8800605 any time somebody says that they committed a murder we are going to take that seriously
8800606 we have no way of knowing whether or not richard cooey is just blowing smoke and making things up or whether he did in fact did kill somebody else more than 20 years ago
8800607 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom will you vote
8800608 john mccain has the best record of any republican running for president on the energy issue and on climate change
8800609 so when you give to the needy do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by men
8800610 impressing me was the only reward he would ever receive for that gesture
8800611 theyll finish working one homicide and try to go home to rest only to get called back in
8800612 i dont know if i can make it husband isnt home yet
8800613 okay well maybe hell be there soon why dont you call him to see if hes on his way
8800614 no im mad at him so i cant call him
8800615 no but i cant sleep when hes not in bed with me and i was up all night i tried waking him up but he kept falling back asleep on the couch hes so ignorant and selfish i got mad at him this morning
8800616 youre mad because he fell asleep you realize that people who fall asleep do that when they are tired and no longer have energy to function
8800617 i dont care i was up all night because of him
8800618 seriously this is why youre mad he didnt do it on purpose can you please stop being dumb and just call him
8800619 looking back at that occurrence for the first and last time it was a missed call
8800620 and it was not because doug eddings an umpire with 10 years experience and 10 before that in the minor leagues didnt know the application of the rule but just that in the moment in applying the rule he saw something he thought was more than it turned out to be
8800621 of course it was a missed call of course aj was cheating again thats what sox players do its their history and their present way why would you expect that to change
8800622 flubs suck wrigley is a beer garden 100 years bartman
8800623 we were expecting a better result but the track was slow and she drew barrier 10 out of 11 horses
8800624 on the one hand we want to try and accommodate bhp billiton but on the other we will be listening to planning sa
8800625 we have the right to say we dont want the road there if it interferes with the residential area which is our main priority
8800626 the biggest thing i ever got was the understanding of mateship honesty and the nature of survival
8800627 we need to recognise our service men and women and appreciate what theyve done for us
8800628 when david was here we had a really good chat
8800629 to david and other people it means a great deal more than to me
8800630 im very privileged to have been commissioned to do this its challenged my whole world view
8800631 increased fuel prices and food prices make life all the more difficult
8800632 it lifts the notch one level higher in regional areas as they pay a lot more than metropolitan
8800633 i only just came on the aged pension but when there are two pensions together its easier
8800634 i dont know that these people who whinge about it are that bad off
8800635 people have to look into things like smoking and playing the pokies and how that affects them
8800636 just for one person i think it would be difficult because you use the same amount of electricity and petrol as a couple would
8800637 playing good football i would even take it to the first couple of weeks in camp where he struggled with a couple of things worked through that and came out in a positive way
8800638 kevin is ready to play and a j has already proven he can play thats a real positive thing right now i have no problem putting kevin in a game right now hell do a good job
8800639 although its just the preseason and the starters werent there with me its still big for me it breaks me in slowly to hopefully what i am going to be one day
8800640 the biggest thing now is to not regress ive gotten progressively better i just cant regress when im sitting on the sidelines i have to make sure i get plenty of reps in practice and keep my part
8800641 the group we have out there right now i really like
8800642 i dont know if its the twos or what it is but it seemed like everyone we had in there had great continuity everyone works hard and thats all you can ask of those guys
8800643 there are a couple of things there that we are working on and i think weve got that nailed down
8800644 i think he has a chance to be a pretty good quarterback so well see how he keeps progressing
8800645 hes been through a full year and going into your second year most players are a little bit more comfortable with the system he can anticipate the upcoming events a little bit better
8800646 so many games are won in the fourth quarter or lost in the fourth quarter so as much as you can you want to keep those guys fresh for the fourth quarter when we go into the fourth quarter i want our best soldiers on the field and you want to press if a guy plays 65 70 plays you go into the fourth quarter and he doesnt have much gas left
8800647 the game has changed a lot in the 13 years ive been in the league
8800648 before defensive linemen had to do everything now you have guys to rush the passer guys playing against the run they used to have to do both you have to study more because youre probably going against more than one guy
8800649 if you get your opportunity and take advantage of it you can play a while because there are a lot of tricks you can learn as you get older
8800650 its because you dont really have to do much more than block people
8800651 a lot of those other guys even if theyre backups are playing on special teams and putting themselves in position where they can get hurt that has a lot to do with it youre asked to do less youre specializing there arent a lot of other things youre doing
8800652 thats when you can get rolled up from behind thats how you get hurt
8800653 i think a lot of the defensive injuries come from friendly fire you know theyre hitting each other during tackles on top of piles and stuff thats how a lot of them get hurt gang tackling but on the offensive line you can control what you hit and how youre getting hit one of the main things we have to protect is our knees getting rolled up on the line of scrimmage
8800654 they know what spot they have to get to so we have to kind of read off their motions thats pretty much the only advantage they have theyre trying to get their hands on us and we have to prevent them from doing that and get our hands on them first you have to learn how to read certain keys so when you see an offensive lineman move a certain way you know how to react thats the biggest thing for us
8800655 theyve probably helped the offensive linemen because they can hold more
8800656 they dont call holding quite as much they let you grab up in here the chest a little bit i dont think they ever put in rules that help the defense theres a rule that you cant touch a receiver after 5 yards everythings changed a little bit to favor the offense
8800657 you have to hold off guys who are 300 some pounds and at the same time try to get to the ball and make reads see where things are at
8800658 youre legal until you get caught youre doing as much as you can get away with
8800659 of course there are going to be some things that go on in the trenches
8800660 but i dont think there are guys who would intentionally try to take someones career from you i dont think there are players who would intentionally go after your knees i really think everybody has a mutual respect for each other out there
8800661 they probably would try to take advantage of an injury they might know about
8800662 but i dont think they would intentionally dive into your knees if they know you have sore knees i dont think theyd dive into your ankle if they knew you had a sprained ankle they might try to give you some extra moves to keep you off balance but its not like a fighter who sees your ear is messed up and tries to attack your ear
8800663 i think theres actually more skill involved because its very technical
8800664 the players in what are called skill positions are in more of an athletic position theres more skill involved in what we do
8800665 absolutely spent was i thinking about leaving him in i definitely had a thought about it but i knew there definitely was no sense in sending him back out
8800666 this is our time to hold these leads this is our job were not getting it done right now
8800667 it would be kind of interesting wouldnt it to play for the nlcs title right here
8800668 now well go back and evaluate the film and make the cuts
8800669 it was my first start although its just the preseason and the starters werent out there with me its still big for me it breaks me in slowly to hopefully what i am going to be one day
8800670 mcdougle has done a heck of a job hes played good football
8800671 free to the families and that allows the child to come to the camp
8800672 we have a close working relationship with our local law enforcement officers and felt this was a great way to encourage kids
8800673 theyre here to have fun and thats what we try to make sure that they have
8800674 i came all the way up here to support you for vice president
8800675 theres supposed to be a suite where i can sit a bit but ive forgotten the number
8800676 yes i believe he will but that promise about read my lips no new taxes that may come back to haunt him in the future if he is elected
8800677 i need to see more of ronnie before i make a decision
8800678 if i dont see a whole lot more of ronnie then ricky will start
8800679 and get a feel for where he is id like to try and play him if we can play him well see whether or not hell get some carries
8800680 if youre tired of typical jocks youve go to like someone like williams who doesnt drink the leagues kool aid and whos capable of saying as ricky did that he loves to play football but hates being a football player
8800681 it would make it very difficult to have contraflow and a football game
8800682 i dont think anyone would want to see that scenario
8800683 i wouldnt want to try and play in that situation but well know a lot more later we could play the game during contraflow is it desirable probably not
8800684 as hurricane gustav threatens the area citizens are urged to make certain they have an evacuation plan and has reminded those living in travel trailers that the structures are unsafe in tropical storms or hurricanes
8800685 citizens who are living in travel trailers need to plan now to evacuate the trailers if they are advised to do so by city officials
8800686 travel trailers are unsafe during heavy winds as we continue to monitor and prepare for the possibility of hurricane gustav i want all of our citizens to make certain they have a plan for leaving the trailers when advised to do so
8800687 in addition to the threat travel trailers pose to people inside them during strong winds the winds also can turn the trailers into missiles that damage nearby structures as of early this week there were 2829 fema trailers in orleans parish n
8800688 if you look at the numbers they really should not be having an election
8800689 maybe harper wants the election now because he hopes all the lpc voters will be distracted by the us election
8800690 liberals disagree articles tonight which im sure will be in their print edition tomorrow
8800691 the liberals wont be firing on all cylinders when an election is called
8800692 due to the updated tracking information on the storm this evening certain parishes may begin their phased evacuations tomorrow and saturday tomorrow morning we will have a more updated weather forecast and will make final determinations on a timeframe for contra flow measures which could begin as early as saturday and certainly by sunday we are watching the storm very carefully but for now families need to be prepared get information about shelters now this is the time to make sure families have a plan visit by this weekend the storm will be in the gulf now is the time for residents to prepare and have a plan for their evacuation or shelter needs

8800743 i dont want just two or one pieces of art sticking in the front yard
8800744 i think we ought to be a little more humble and community minded
8800745 virtually everyone weve talked to says they have no information about the job a judge is doing and that they are voting blindly
8800746 i wish the djs on this station werent so bumptious
8800747 its big for us we want to come out here and put together a couple of good drives and we were able to do that we did what we needed to do
8800748 it was thats why we played a little bit longer we knew we werent as bad as we played last week it was good for us to get back out here and get some confidence heading into our game with the patriots
8800749 those are two really good running backs it was good getting jamaal out there he might be one of the fastest football players ive ever been around he is a football player he loves blocking hes great running screens hes going to be a huge help for us this year
8800750 this is what we all wanted as soon as you start training camp you look forward to that first game you dont look forward to preseason games you look forward to when it counts were ready to go in there and get going
8800751 i think we did what we had planned to do after last week we wanted to get back on a positive note going into the regular season and i think thats what we did we did some things that we really liked and our young guys really played hard and finished the game off the way you want them to
8800752 i think these last two weeks have been a real challenge mentally for this football team we realized something after the miami game it really wasnt that bad im sure well realize some things after this game that werent that good hopefully well get back to being a really consistent football team we have 16 chances to become a playoff football team and we want to be as consistent as possible
8800753 we had to come in here and get a win at arrowhead and we got it done they fought back at the end but we got it done
8800754 thats where you have to take pride down in that area the team has two choices they can punch it in for a touchdown or they can end up attempting a field goal or they could turn it over of course we always want to get either a turnover or force them into that field goal we try our best to keep them out of the end zone
8800755 bill richardson is our man barak obama is a phony tax increases and liquid coal
8800756 i tell you the truth all those who have left houses brothers sister mother father children or farms for me and for the good news will get more than they left here in this world they will have a hundred times more homes brothers sisters mothers children and fields and with those things they will also suffer for their belief but in the age that is coming they will have life forever
8800757 whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother wife and children brothers and sisters yes and even life itself cannot be my disciple
8800758 wherever your treasure is there your heart will be also
8800759 brodie do you even know what the trophy is called that you are playing for tomorrow
8800760 you never know whats going to happen emotionally to your football team when you have an hour delay but i thought sitting in the locker room for about 30 minutes and listening to the players and the music that was going on i figured wed be pretty loose when we came back out we were
8800761 it showed in how we played especially the first quarter
8800762 i thought our seconds at the end held on and did some things that needed to be done to win the football game that was good to see because in the last couple of weeks the seconds and thirds didnt do a good job and the games got away from us good win for us good way to finish the pre season
8800763 i dont know about that i dont think you can go on one play fumble theres a multitude of things you have to look at when evaluating players b j did a good job returning the ball first time i saw a spark in the guy it looked like the old b j sams like we had seen in baltimore he took the ball and ran with authority the good thing about savage is when he got his opportunity again he really ran it well
8800764 he was actually supposed to be in the game plan as the rain got going i got more nervous and told him he was scratched he wanted to play and tried to sneak out there on the first series looking at me with his helmet i said oh no tony gonzalez didnt play and brian waters played a series the rest of those guys played a bit
8800765 every state service that could possibly be performed more efficiently by the private sector
8800766 makes it virtually impossible to privatize any governmental services or renew contracts of existing services being rendered by private vendors
8800767 capable vendors will be dissuaded from bidding on new or renewal contracts when faced with the possibility of enduring a process that could be held up for years in internal analysis and litigation
8800768 this whole thing once its all said and done could take 12 months

8800771 predator i want you to go through these receipts and sort them chronologically
8800772 isnt this amazing isnt this gorgeous arent you glad we did this
8800773 suffered psychological and physical injury which required medical and psychological treatment
8800774 continues to lack basic rules protecting children from sexual assault
8800775 the defendants fraudulently when is a jew not acting fraudulently induced joel engelman to enter into this exchange of mutual promises and oral contract
8800776 there were multiple credible complaints of sexual abuse made against reichman
8800777 i really didn t want this to get into the courts
8800778 had they done things differently and fired reichman i probably wouldn t have sued this is the last thing i wanted
8800779 eerst voor het basisonderwijs maar tegen 2016 zullen we ook moeten zien dat er voldoende secundaire scholen zijn vlaanderen houdt voor de verdeling van de subsidies en de goedkeuring van de bouwdossiers op dit moment geen rekening met de te verwachten bevolkingsevolutie dit moet dringend een objectief criterium worden anders wordt het bijzonder moeilijk om de dreigende schaarste van scholen in de stad op te vangen
8800780 it is with profound gratitude and great humility that i accept your nomination for presidency of the united states
8800781 people of america enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8800782 we love this country too much to let the next four years be just like the last eight
8800783 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8800784 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8800785 its time for the republican party to own its failure its time for us to change america and thats why im running for president of the united states
8800786 lives in the hopes and dreams the competence and courage the rightness and readiness of barack obama
8800787 as we walk we must make the pledge we must always march ahead do not turn back
8800788 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
8800789 let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america
8800790 we are going to hire a head coach in a similar way to other hirings that we have made at sounders fc the head coach will be an individual of high character someone who wants to be in seattle and who will be very proud to live in the city and be part of the community we will hire a head coach who understands and embraces the mls system and who is willing to put in the hard work necessary to creatively put a winning side on the pitch given the mls salary cap coaching in mls is slightly unique and requires a certain mentality
8800791 we are also looking for a head coach who is willing to coach many players coming out of the university system still need a decent amount of technical and tactical support and we want a staff that is willing and able to supply all of the support needed to allow players to continue to evolve their game the head coach will interact daily with the technical director chris henderson and myself and will be part of a team all working together for the same goals
8800792 we are trying to balance being out there looking for and signing players while being cognizant of a head coaches need to have a large degree of influence over the players that he wants but what we didnt want was a completely blank slate when the head coach walks in the door to sounders fc we hope to give him a head start and the tools and a few players necessary to be successful
8800793 to be a division i a coach youve got to have started somewhere else i believe and vmi let me tell you from the heart it made me a better man and a better coach
8800794 if frequent flier miles make you a better coach then bills good because hes been everywhere
8800795 but he deserves it hes worked hard bills just an old country boy born in west virginia there aint no hidden agenda hes not in it for the limelight
8800796 sometimes the way it shakes down the right people are in the right place at the right time
8800797 for instance 125 young men eight days seven nights in the desert getting ready for the fiesta bowl
8800798 and when you come out on the field and you see that flying wv youd better be ready to put your mouthpiece in because youre going to get hit flush right in the jaw thats what id like to have remembered about this program
8800799 the demand for wii hardware globally has been unprecedented and higher than nintendo could ever have anticipated

8800811 people dont hack accounts by using programs and any other bullsh that you hear around xbox live
8800812 the following problem is a quite fundamental problem in robotics
8800813 we think that if we can embed these cues in control systems we can make following more reliable
8800814 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8800815 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8800816 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8800817 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8800818 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
8800819 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8800820 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
8800821 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8800822 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways
8800823 we commend the u s department of justice criminal divisions computer crime and intellectual property section the u s attorneys offices for the western district of north carolina and the eastern district of virginia and the federal bureau of investigation for their work in bringing these criminals to justice
8800824 these decisions illustrate once again that game piracy will not be tolerated and the extent at which these criminals will be prosecuted the esa and its members will continue to support law enforcements efforts to protect the intellectual property of our industry
8800825 oneill you will wish to tune your television to channel 4
8800826 we were bleep attacked you bleep cops do your bleep bleep bleep
8800827 what in the bleep does a bleep guy have to do to get any service around here bleep die
8800828 there were some guys that were like on pcp or something and they came out of no where they attacked this kid here and i helped him out
8800829 yeahsureyoubetcha more like i helped you out pirate boy and whats with that shirt did don ho puke on you or what
8800830 make that tried to help him out rambo here screamed like a little girl and peed his pants
8800831 knock it off you two you both have the right to remain silent
8800832 youre right the girls i know wouldnt scream like that unless there was a shoe sale involved
8800833 anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law
8800834 the girls you know only scream when the farmer yells sooooooeeeeee
8800835 the girls i know dont think im a walking happy meal runt boy and when they find out you called them pigs
8800836 you are so going to be not wanting to be alive boy
8800837 im not afraid of girls don and i am the full meal deal
8800838 im talkin here youve got the right to an attorney
8800839 scrawny bugger like you youre about 4 quarts tops hardly a full meal for her
8800840 if you cant afford an attorney one will be appointed for you
8800841 do either of you two understand these right as ive explained them to you
8800842 well ah im stephanie messner with ksgo in colorado springs near evergreen cemetery where local police have just arrested two men in connection with the dracula murders
8800843 t have the ood call in hammond im on my way in
8800844 weve made movies to show this traffic jam as a function of energy at some energies the traffic is moving and at others the electron traffic is completely blocked
8800845 it has been a frustrating and embarrassing problem to explain why this is the case
8800846 its like taking some cars off the highway during rush hour all of a sudden the traffic starts to move
8800847 in essence the research shows that what is believed to be required to increase the superconductivity in these systems stronger magnetic interactions also pushes the system closer to the quantum traffic jam status where lack of holes locks the electrons into positions from which they cannot move its like gassing up the cars and then jamming them all onto the highway at once theres lots of energy but no ability to go anywhere
8800848 we need to look for materials with such strong pairing but which dont exhibit this mottness or quantum traffic jam effect
8800849 our hope is that they will have less traffic jam effect while having stronger electron pairing
8800850 a third of all cases of cerebral palsy are associated with preterm birth
8800851 this study shows a significant reduction in cerebral palsy among preterm infants whose mothers were given magnesium sulfate
8800852 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to date that looked at using this inexpensive and commonly used treatment to reduce the occurrence of cerebral palsy after preterm birth
8800853 cerebral palsy cant always be prevented but the data from our study and its predecessors will help obstetricians make informed treatment decisions for the women under their care
8800854 our results show that obstetricians can use magnesium sulfate which they have experience prescribing to reduce the risk of a devastating condition cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8800855 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8800856 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8800857 het gaat dus alleen maar over een plan niet meer dan dat
8800858 geeft de raad van bestuur groen licht dan zullen we eerst de medewerkers van donna informeren over de krachtlijnen alvorens we ermee naar buiten komen
8800859 het schema gaat gewoon door met alle programmas rubrieken acties noem maar op
8800860 op de bosuil hebben ze ons de perfecte motivatie bezorgd
8800861 improving crystal quality and purity leads to explosive materials that are safer less likely to react violently when subjected to mechanical impact or heat
8800862 the design of custom solvents through first principles modeling opens up new possibilities for the dissolution of materials that are hard to dissolve
8800863 dit betekent niet dat de prijzenpot van de nu lopende verkiezing in gevaar komt
8800864 wij wensen ons logo niet langer te verbinden aan het evenement
8800865 maar wij hebben ons contract gerespecteerd spijtig dat het zo moet lopen maar voor ons is het genoeg geweest
8800866 hoe de organisator die auto financiert moet hij weten en of het dit jaar een nissan of een ander merk wordt dat is onze zaak niet
8800867 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8800868 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8800869 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8800870 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8800871 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8800872 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people
8800873 het aantal belgen dat gezamenlijk stookolie aankoopt neemt spectaculair toe
8800874 de verkopers krijgen hierdoor het mes op de keel op korte termijn leidt dit tot goedkopere prijzen maar op lange termijn kan het de sector n de consument zuur opbreken
8800875 ik deed met enkele vrienden van de zaalvoetbalclub een gezamenlijke aankoop
8800876 we bestelden met vijf personen in totaal 12 000 liter doordat de handelaars op grote hoeveelheden extra korting geven kreeg ik mijn 2 500 liter voor 130 euro minder dan de normale prijs van 2 214 euro
8800877 zo kunnen mensen een superbestelling plaatsen m t bijbehorende superkorting
8800878 mensen die zitten te wachten op hun pensioencheque anderen die als ocmw steuntrekker op belangrijke documenten wachten het zijn maar enkele voorbeelden die aantonen dat een gebrekkige postbestelling heel wat schade kan berokkenen vaak zijn het bewoners die zich niet durven tonen om te reageren op deze toestanden ikzelf krijg als ocmw raadslid normaal heel wat belangrijke documenten in mijn bus het kan toch niet dat ik daarop moet wachten
8800879 eerst dacht ik joepie geen post geen rekeningen maar dat was ijdele hoop de rekeningen vielen een week later massaal in de bus ik ben naar het postkantoor aan de augustijnslei geweest en daar wist men niet goed hoe te reageren ze geven echt wel toe dat er problemen zijn de manier waarop men achteraan naar mijn belangrijke poststukken moest gaan zoeken past ook niet voor een modern bedrijf ik heb verder de indruk dat de klachten van het personeel niet worden gehoord het zou wel van enig respect voor de burger getuigen als men de mensen zou inlichten via de gemeente brasschaat zouden de infoborden kunnen worden gebruikt om de mensen op de hoogte te brengen ik heb minister vervotte cd amp v een brief gestuurd want dit getuigt alleszins niet van goed bestuur
8800880 er zijn verschillende manieren om geld te verdienen met je lichaam via internet als artiest als freelancer ik kan niet zeggen welke manier je moet toepassen want het belangrijkste is dat je het graag doet dan gaat het vanzelf
8800881 de republikeinen zeiden dat ik te jong en te onervaren was klinkt dat bekend het werkte in 1992 niet omdat we aan de goede kant van de geschiedenis zaten en het zal in 2008 niet werken omdat barack obama aan de goede kant van de geschiedenis zit
8800882 deze tijden vragen om meer dan een goede soldaat ze vereisen een wijs leider
8800883 die kinderen zaten in een gevaarlijke zelfs levensgevaarlijke situatie maar iemand die kanker heeft gehad en nog in de periode van vijf jaar zit dat er een risico is op hervallen die vormt als pleegouder blijkbaar een te groot risico
8800884 ik stelde mij kandidaat en kreeg verschillende keren sociaal assistenten over de vloer die mij het hemd van het lijf vroegen uiteindelijk zeiden ze dat ik geen jonge pleegkinderen voor lange termijn mocht opvangen omdat het niet in het belang van de kinderen zou zijn alleen noodopvang voor korte tijd was mogelijk tja bij mij zouden de kinderen uit kapellen wel nog hebben geleefd ik heb nooit een misdrijf gepleegd ik heb alleen maar kanker gehad
8800885 maar nu wil ik weten hoe hij het stelt kent iemand lars
8800886 hij was buiten bewustzijn en bloedde uit de neus en mond en aan zijn armen hij lag in volle zon en met zijn hoofd naar beneden sommige mensen wilden hem daarom omdraaien maar dat mag je niet doen door het lichaam te verplaatsen kan je grote schade aanbrengen
8800887 hij kon zeggen dat hij lars heette en belg was maar daarna verloor hij opnieuw het bewustzijn
8800888 ik had waarschijnlijk de handrem niet goed opgetrokken maar daar denk je in zon situatie niet aan
8800889 volgens de eigenaar van onze camping moet zijn toestand daarom ernstig zijn geweest dat maakt me nog ongeruster
8800890 ze vroegen of ik een kennis of familie van het slachtoffer was mogelijk kreeg ik geen informatie om privacyredenen
8800891 de man heet lars is een dertiger en belg maar waar is hij nu hoe stelt hij het heeft hij de klap overleefd dat weet ik allemaal niet en het kwelt me
8800892 what the nay sayers dont understand is that its been about you
8800893 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy
8800894 college student experience of mental health service use and psychiatric medication
8800895 university mental health providers have observed increased numbers of students visiting college mental health centers
8800896 were at a time when students are being diagnosed at a younger age with mental illnesses
8800897 if you ask me its kosher i can even prove it has scales
8800898 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8800899 currently food heated in a microwave loses heat to the cold dish because the dishes are transparent to microwaves
8800900 the plates are still cool when the cooking is completed
8800901 dishes heated by themselves or with food could keep the food hot of up to 15 minutes one might even cook a pizza on a plate and then deliver it hot
8800902 we used cooking oil because it is an innocuous substance
8800903 we could perhaps use this material in a closed system to decompose organic contaminants in soil or dirt
8800904 well insert name here tends to kick me in the shins under the dining room table saying
8800905 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8800906 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8800907 i assume he qualified to run for the seat and he was elected
8800908 anybody in this country can join a party and run for a position on that party he is entitled to be seated if he acts according to our constitution
8800909 hopefully he left that past behind he shouldnt forget that this party was formed by abolitionists
8800910 we checked the young man out and his victory may not be valid
8800911 we required that candidates sign an oath of loyalty in june and he didnt do it as far as were concerned eduardo won
8800912 my understanding is that the oath had to be signed by the first meeting of the new committeemen and thats by dec 1 theyre obviously looking for a way to keep me out but i wont let that happen
8800913 his mom chloe took him around introducing him to everyone
8800914 i ran because i want to make an impact at the local level dont judge me by my family judge me by what i want to achieve i want to sway my party to do something about the immigration invasion and the tax burden
8800915 everyone in this country has the right to protect his groups interests white people will soon be a minority
8800916 hopefully he left that past behind he shouldnt forget that this party was formed by abolitionists
8800917 we checked the young man out and his victory may not be valid
8800918 hopefully he left that past behind he shouldnt forget that this party was formed by abolitionists
8800919 i ran because i want to make an impact at the local level dont judge me by my family judge me by what i want to achieve i want to sway my party to do something about the immigration invasion and the tax burden
8800920 i want to sway my party to do something about the immigration invasion and the tax burden
8800921 everyone in this country has the right to protect his groups interests white people will soon be a minority
8800922 para mi sorpresa me preguntaron si quer a dirigir un corto utilizando a los protagonistas de la pel cula y al principio no entend a el encargo porque nunca hab a visto que una franquicia de pel culas incluyera a un corto
8800923 si alguien me hubiera dicho que exist a un corto de treinta minutos sobre the dark knight hubiera sido el primero de la cola para verlo
8800924 mi corto se debe entender como un puente entre la primera pel cula y la ltima
8800925 un mercenario con c digo tico muy particular que ha sobrevivido a las guerras que han devastado el mundo desde principios del siglo xxi
8800926 if those are the kind of people you are catering to i dont want to work here
8800927 with three real examples we hope that we have shown that such trials are feasible and can lead to major improvements in speed and decision making
8800928 what prosecutors oftentimes want is an admission on the part of the public official and resignation
8800929 its a significant bargaining chip that he has if hes already removed from office then that certainly could have a possible impact on the plea negotiations
8800930 if he wants to leave the criminal cases he is going to need to do it before the removal is resolved
8800931 or you take your chances by going through the removal proceedings you fight that fight and see what happens
8800932 there are public officials who survive these trials and continue in office
8800933 there also are public officials who fight their cases get convicted and serve more time in jail than they would have if they had pleaded guilty or resigned
8800934 the governor is the sole tribunal in removal proceedings with no right of appeal or review afforded the accused
8800935 if the governor acts within the law the governors decision is final
8800936 but i dont believe the question about an appeal has ever been raised
8800937 the cumulative disadvantages experienced by some youths contribute to lower voter turnout
8800938 rising economic segregation and economic inequality has the potential to increase political inequality in the united states
8800939 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8800940 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8800941 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice
8800942 f it when am i gonna be back in nyc
8800943 rip your arm off and beat you to death with it
8800944 no discutan conmigo por favor no discutan con el hombre que acaba de perder a la que fue su esposa por 55 a os
8800945 fueron 55 buenos a os saben nadie puede hablar del amor verdadero si no tiene idea de lo que es compartir la vida con una mujer as hizo una pausa y se limpi la cara ella y yo estuvimos juntos en todo alegr as y penas cuando nacieron ustedes cuando me echaron de mi trabajo cuando ustedes enfermaban continu siempre estuvimos juntos compartimos la alegr a de ver a nuestros hijos terminar sus carreras lloramos uno al lado del otro la partida de seres queridos rezamos juntos en la sala de espera de muchos hospitales nos apoyamos en el dolor nos abrazamos y perdonamos nuestras faltas hijos ahora se ha ido y estoy contento saben por qu porque se fue antes que yo no tuvo que vivir la agon a y el dolor de enterrarme de quedarse sola despu s de mi partida ser yo quien pase por eso y le doy gracias a dios la amo tanto que no me hubiera gustado que sufriera

8800947 but again hopefully our depth will come into play while hes out
8800948 obviously its not good news for us hes one of our main guys
8800949 but we dont think its a season ending injury there will be no panic emergency moves immediately
8800950 i dont think anyone around here should feel victimized or have negative thoughts or that this is just something happens to the warriors it happens in life and sports you have to deal with it head on
8800951 one thing monta has done each year is improve real improvement comes during summer
8800952 once training camp comes its time to hone skills once the season starts its about maintenance taking care of your body and getting your rest
8800953 broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8800954 stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8800955 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8800956 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8800957 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8800958 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8800959 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8800960 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8800961 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8800962 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8800963 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8800964 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8800965 thats why i stand here tonight because for 232 years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8800966 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
8800967 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year
8800968 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8800969 in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan i see my grandfather who signed up after pearl harbour marched in pattons army and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill
8800970 in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift i think about my mom who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships
8800971 we must also admit that fulfilling americas promise will require more than just money
8800972 while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8800973 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8800974 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying iraq
8800975 you dont protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington
8800976 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8800977 misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8800978 human life from the moment of conception is to always be respected treated with dignity and protected
8800979 catholics who support so called abortion rights support a false right promote a culture of death
8800980 out of respect for the teaching of jesus christ and the church
8800981 any catholic who supports abortion rights has placed himself or herself outside of visible unity with the church and thus should refrain from receiving holy communion
8800982 the church has taught for centuries that life begins at conception and there is no room for misrepresentation of that teaching
8800983 in addition modern medical techniques have been able to confirm what the church has already known
8800984 the aim of nato is to keep the americans in to keep the russians out and to keep the germans down
8800985 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war but we dont want one and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8800986 i cant believe i said id do this shoot when i havent been able to exercise for almost eight weeks
8800987 i was worried about getting out of shape and gaining weight after the surgery so just as i did with my pregnancies i decided to go into it at my physical best
8800988 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8800989 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8800990 i have a lot of respect for paris hilton shes ballsy shes learned to play with the paparazzi attention and have fun with it and she creates little mysteries in the tabloid arena i have fun with her but its always been platonic our relationship wasnt sexual though i understand that sex sells
8800991 she and i have a very open communication were friends with common interests if you want to know the whole story youve got to be my friend its easy to put those labels on people but theyre not accurate were young in hollywood having fun
8800992 now one more operator has been permitted so again we consulted the trai and took a decision that it can also be auctioned
8800993 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8800994 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8800995 removal of products laced with caffeine from your diet will improve your health considerably
8800996 and the only other ppl from the station who should ever have the license to interrupt juan ep are
8800997 once i can make calls using the wifi network i will in all likelihood reduce the monthly minutes i have with at amp t
8800998 i dont think carriers are going to let voip to take as much revenue as its taken from residential phone providers
8800999 i think we are seeing a real change in operator approaches to skype
8801000 theres a realization that providing customers with additional modes of communications is good the real battle is how do you keep your customers engaged
8801001 the physical process of activating the phone is the bottleneck
8801002 if the problems linger and the percentage of people being impacted grows theyll have a problem
8801003 were always working to improve our products for our customers
8801004 was chosen because it is one of the most modern buildings hence the most compatible with technologies of this sort moreover there was a need to restore the roof
8801005 especially important for us were the popes words pronounced on jan 1 2007 on the occasion of the world day of peace in which he called for an ecological awareness which would be translated into concrete programs and initiatives
8801006 the production of these panels will constitute 60 70 of the necessary energy in those buildings thus lessening energy expenses the work will begin in october and the solar plant might be able to begin to function this year
8801007 it is almost an experience of ecstasy that arises for example with the prolonged listening to russian liturgical singing
8801008 these moments were like a foretaste of the beatific vision and the communion of saints
8801009 might contribute to enhance mutual knowledge and the desire for unity
8801010 to be pilgrims means to try to enter into the spirit of the christian east and to begin to breathe as john paul ii so dreamed also with that lung of christianity
8801011 with emotion i say that i hope the day will soon come when the patriarch of moscow will be able to embrace the successor of peter
8801012 estamos aqu porque amamos demasiado a este pa s para dejar que los pr ximos cuatro a os sean como los ltimos ocho
8801013 el 4 de noviembre debemos levantarnos y decir ocho son suficientes
8801014 ahora yo no creo que al senador mccain no le importe lo que est pasando con las vidas de los estadounidenses sencillamente creo que l no sabe no es que a john mccain no le importe es que john mccain no lo entiende
8801015 como comandante en jefe nunca dudar en defender a este pa s pero s lo enviar a nuestras tropas al peligro con una misi n clara y con el compromiso sagrado de darles el equipamiento necesario en batalla y el cuidado y los beneficios que merecen cuando regresen a casa
8801016 a john mccain le gusta decir que seguir a bin laden hasta las puertas del infierno pero l ni siquiera ha ido a la cueva donde vive bin laden
8801017 they were yelling eff you back and forth at each other
8801018 she stated that she saw the group in her headlights
8801019 she stated that her intent was to scare this group and that she believed they would see her and get out of the way
8801020 it was stuck there the front end of the vehicle was off the ground more or less impaled by the parking meter
8801021 the force of the impact was so great that when striking the pole the back of the vehicle actually lifted up off the ground
8801022 this is a convergence of factors many of which were not in her control which produced a high degree of fear
8801023 she didnt invite these people to be pounding on her car or pursuing her car
8801024 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge

8801058 and now at this hour barack obama is officially the democratic party nominee for president of the united states vote for him or do not but take pride that this nation can produce men and speakers such as that for 42 minutes not a sour note and spell binding throughout in a way usually reserved for the creations of fiction an extraordinary political statement wtf almost a fully realized tough crisp insistent speech in tone and in the sense of cutting through the clutter huh akin to the words that were given to the fictional title character in that aaron sorkin film the american president lmao only this cut the crap moment is not the stuff of fiction this is the real thing out here id love to find something to criticize about it

8801066 a nintendo vendeu 300 000 consoles mais 300 000 c pias de mario 64 e perto de 200 000 c pias de pilot wings 64
8801067 no dia 24 de janeiro de 2001 a sega lan ou um comunicado para a imprensa anunciando a descontinua o do dreamcast
8801068 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
8801069 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
8801070 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
8801071 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
8801072 in louisiana my parents told me that i could be anybody i wanted when they left the room i giggled
8801073 we knew they were lying to us because doors were closed to women and minorities in this country
8801074 you who wait for this time of change it couldnt have come on a better time because those doors are never going to be closed again
8801075 the fight for blacks latinos asians is the fight for america to live off the true freedom it professes
8801076 first opponents said obama is too black now hes too white
8801077 we are still living in a nation where women earn 70 cents on a dollar of a man and for minority women its more like 50 cents
8801078 but obama doesnt have to respond to it were black white asians we are a movement
8801079 all along during the primary hillary and barack were very close on the issues what it boiled down to as far as differences go was the candidates experience
8801080 it dismays me to hear people i am going to vote for mccain if you are true to what hillary believes you would never vote for mccain
8801081 will the republicans stop the war no will the democrats do no who will we will
8801082 the most important thing about this whole democratic process is that we should think about what were doing
8801083 i didnt want to sit and yell at my television we all in this planet are responsible for demonstrating for peace
8801084 to make sure no one voted for george w bush
8801085 i am astonished that 100 000 people are not demonstrating here today
8801086 114 members of congress have masters degrees 23 have ph d s and 240 are lawyers clegg said
8801087 if they are so smart how come they cant balance the budget
8801088 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8801089 people are always surprised by how much it would cost to replace everything they own
8801090 its a benefit to you so you dont have to rely on your memory after youve just gone through a traumatic experience
8801091 they have mindsets like homeowners and understand the need for it
8801092 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8801093 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
8801094 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8801095 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8801096 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop
8801097 we would much prefer to design a vehicle that provides good protection for unbelted occupants but is tuned specifically to protect occupants that are doing what theyre supposed to be doing
8801098 its very difficult for governments that have had a specific regulation on their books for many years to suddenly decide to change
8801099 we think its very important to have a single set of requirements that can be enacted globally
8801100 the broadly unanticipated behavior of world bond markets remains a conundrum
8801101 mortgages are now considered riskier than they used to be
8801102 thats one of the biggest factors in this credit crunch
8801103 to me it says the banks are holding more of the profits on these mortgages to make up for the losses that theyve experienced over the last several years
8801104 if the state doesnt want to play the video it doesnt have to play the video we try these cases all time without video
8801105 if youre going to use the video im going to require that you play the whole thing
8801106 what would your remedy be if we refuse to do that
8801107 we dont plan on playing the entire video even if the court orders us to do so
8801108 courts order the state and defendants how to present evidence all the time
8801109 its called the rules of evidence i think the courts order was correct
8801110 the state will offer you testimony of a 6 year old girl talking about things that happened when she was 2 or 3 years old
8801111 it is not true it did not happen the fact that she repeats it in court does not make it true
8801112 in the entire three hour interview not one single time does the defendant deny these accusations
8801113 there wont be baseball in nashua next year as we presently know it or at least under my ownership
8801114 for three years we sat here and worked very diligently to keep the nashua pride here in nashua
8801115 im sorry we werent able to succeed to accomplish what our goal was which was to keep baseball in nashua it just didnt make business sense we took it as long as we could we accomplished a lot
8801116 whether its because youve got affiliated baseball 17 miles to the north the double a manchester fisher cats or to 17 miles to the south single a lowell mass spinners all i can tell you is i couldnt energize the nashua fan base to get here i did everything i know how to do ive taken this as far as i can so there will be no nashua pride as you know it today in nashua next year
8801117 which would allow me to look for a group here or somewhere else to buy the franchise
8801118 but between the weather and youve been here if a local company wants to come in it could be done but youve got to get the large corporations to commit they dont have to commit to a hell of a lot
8801119 my wife and i didnt want to do this a month ago i thought we could still pull it off not a very happy day sometimes you have to face the realities of life
8801120 im not willing to give up that there might be something that can be done
8801121 john stepped up when nobody else would you can only do it for so long i think there are people in the community who thought he was sitting back there raking in money that is so not the case
8801122 i am hopeful that we have an opportunity here to think of something to keep this stadium as beautiful as it is
8801123 if there isnt a professional team in holman that wouldnt be beneficial to the community
8801124 i dont think the league sees that as their role
8801125 theres a way to keep it here some how some way we were making progress but its hard for john
8801126 and one of the saddest things is people dont even realize it
8801127 this years success will start from the goal cage out
8801128 if our defense plays strong we may suprise some teams in our first season
8801129 last year we had trouble scoring we have a great group of girls and everybody is giving 110 percent in practice
8801130 we are a very young team but we have lots of heart and dedication
8801131 were looking forward to taking that dedication and building off it
8801132 coming together as a team will be a key for us
8801133 for the team to work well together it will take communication both on and off the field
8801134 speed and overall chemistry and devotion are keys for us
8801135 though we lost nine players seven starters our returning players have worked hard in off season
8801136 offensively we are solid playing confidently between our midfield and offense our two goalies are both solid players and communicate well on the field defensively we lost all three starters so we continue to work daily on strengthening and rebuilding we are a team of competitors
8801137 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8801138 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8801139 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8801140 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8801141 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8801142 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8801143 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8801144 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis also in mens
8801145 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8801146 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8801147 governments only get one opportunity to sell a public asset and if they decide to sell its essential that taxpayers get the best possible price
8801148 the demand for wii hardware globally has been unprecedented and higher than nintendo could ever have anticipated
8801149 nintendo had a substantial supply nationwide for launch though some stores saw spot shortages due to unprecedented demand for this unique product

8801155 no es a causa de que a john mccain no le importe es por que john mccain no lo entiende
8801156 la semana que viene en minnesota el mismo partido que les ha tra do dos legislaturas de george bush y dick cheney pedir a este pa s una tercera
8801157 el 4 de noviembre debemos levantarnos y decir ocho es suficiente
8801158 a john mccain le gusta decir que seguir a bin laden hasta las puertas del infierno pero no llegar ni a la cueva donde vive
8801159 que dice acerca de su juicio el que est de acuerdo con bush el 90 por ciento de las veces
8801160 si john mccain quiere tener un debate sobre qui n tiene el temperamento el juicio de servir como el pr ximo comandante en jefe ese es un debate para el que estoy preparado asegur
8801161 somos el partido de roosevelt somos el partido de kennedy as que no me dig is que los dem cratas no defendemos este pa s
8801162 como comandante en jefe nunca vacilar a defender esta naci n pero s lo enviar a nuestras tropas al peligro con una misi n clara y un compromiso sagrado de darles el equipamiento que necesitan en la batalla y el cuidado y las ventajas que merecen cuando vuelven a casa

8801164 no se que tipo de vidas cree john mccain que tienen las celebridades pero esa ha sido la m a
8801165 esos son mis h roes sus abuelos esas son las historias que me formaron y por ellos pretendo ganar estas elecciones
8801166 si hubi semos querido fichar a cazorla le habr amos tra do
8801167 credible users suggests this site may not be what it claims to be
8801168 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
8801169 cheev is trying to reach something on the floor that is the approximate size and shape of a coffin only one corner of the long black box sticks out of the shadows into the bluish green glare of the loft a thick strip of gleaming silver edges the object and is secured to it with silvery bolts get away from there shouts voke as cheev stoops over the box fingering its lid but before he can open it before he can make another move voke makes his ive done my best for you mr veech and youve given me nothing but grief ive tried to deliver you from the fate of your friends but now i deliver you to it join them cheev at these words cheevs body begins to rise in a puppets hunch then soars up into the tenebrous rafters and beyond transported by unseen wires his arms and legs twitch uncontrollably during the elevation and his screams fade
8801170 what does it mean to be alive except to court disaster and suffering at every moment
8801171 i knew it was going to change but i didnt realize it would change so fast
8801172 this used to be a lake now its a real new hampshire river with boulders instead of a sandy bottom
8801173 theres a lot we dont know about a situation like this
8801174 this is a chance to test our theories to see what change actually occur it can be very complicated
8801175 this has a lot of regional interest and i think it will spread farther than the region as it becomes known
8801176 nonetheless you still stand there going wow because its just such a big difference
8801177 our small community banks they didnt write the subprime adjustable rates that are causing all the problems
8801178 that isnt to say there isnt a fallout that all of us are dealing with
8801179 the people running banks here in new hampshire went through that process thats probably a good part of the reason they didnt get involved in those subprime loans
8801180 we have no concerns for the continued viability of any state chartered banks
8801181 what does it mean to be alive except to court disaster and suffering at every moment
8801182 and last year was a very challenging time with the teacher contract
8801183 i guess id have to say we all did a pretty good job together of getting out of that
8801184 there is a lot of hope and enthusiasm this year
8801185 and i think that is going to translate to some real success and allow us to do what were supposed to do which is focus in on student learning
8801186 the mix we have of youth and veteran teachers is very good
8801187 were still challenged in attracting minority candidates to teach and well do more work in that area
8801188 having diversity in the staff and leadership that mirrors the diversity of the students is really important in the school system
8801189 the goal there was to start building our leadership at the principal level and really focus on leadership in our schools
8801190 if we believe every student can really achieve at high levels then we have to find the way to create the opportunities so they can be successful
8801191 do we need to have three levels do we need to have them in the way they are now i dont know
8801192 but i know that we need some kind of grouping
8801193 con profunda gratitud y gran humildad acepto su nominaci n para la presidencia de estados unidos
8801194 solamente enviar a nuestras tropas a correr riesgo de vida con una misi n clara y un compromiso sagrado de darles el equipamiento necesario para el combate y el cuidado y beneficios que se merecen cuando vuelvan a casa
8801195 y estamos aqu porque amamos este pa s demasiado como para dejar que los pr ximos cuatro a os se parezcan a los ltimos ocho
8801196 estados unidos vale m s que estos ocho a os nuestro pa s vale m s que esto
8801197 hoy los estadounidenses fueron testigos de un discurso enga oso que se contradice fundamentalmente con el magro historial de obama
8801198 y vamos a tener a un presidente que le ponga atenci n a latinoam rica y a m xico
8801199 la multitud que esperamos es un indicador de la campa a que ha desarrollado el senador obama desde el inicio el cambio ocurre de abajo hacia arriba
8801200 to know thats happening is unsettling i probably would have picked another place
8801201 i think i would definitely be more diligent about whos around
8801202 my initial thoughts were good for the man who called it in its a shame theres not more they can get duval on

8801213 there are so many married people out there that are ashamed of it specifically rappers they dont want people to know theyre married because they think it will taint their record sales or girls wont like them
8801214 i think more women respect me now knowing that im married and i love my wife
8801215 if you dont want people to know you married you should never got married sic
8801216 with snoop with his reality show father hood thats a great show for hip hop because it shows you can still be married have kids and still be the same you
8801217 i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that
8801218 i believe in his mccain ideals and his proposals to lead this nation hes been a fighter for the hispanic community
8801219 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that daddy yankee and mccain
8801220 the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him
8801221 were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war
8801222 if he believes john mccain is the better candidate for the latinos we could sit down even if he wants to get into a debate we can debate anywhere
8801223 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8801224 im really humbled by the opportunity to spend more time with our nations finest this is such an honour for me to be able to visit with our military and tell them how much we truly appreciate all the sacrifices they make for our country and our freedom
8801225 when i turned 75 my manager and the insurance company said no more
8801226 but i could still drive the tour bus if i wanted im pretty good for a guy with diabetes and bad knees
8801227 we didnt go anywhere we did everything ourselves we were frugal i did all the cooking and cleaning fred did all the repair work in the house
8801228 occasionally he or i would get royalty cheques it was great i had a chance to learn and study my husband taught me about politics and golf and how to play the clarinet
8801229 in the 16 years i was out of the public eye i did more writing that id done ever before i wrote three novels that have yet to be published i painted i drew i had my children it was a very good time in my life
8801230 the time when i was away from music ended up being the only time that i spent alone with him thats proof to me that i made the right choice
8801231 whats two to three more days on a project that weve worked two to three years on
8801232 1999 da poca em que o prince ainda era prince entrou direto no meu
8801233 can i call it a great speech if i dont share the same perspective on all of it
8801234 i think we all had fun once we knew it was all safe
8801235 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield ill
8801236 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8801237 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8801238 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8801239 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8801240 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8801241 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8801242 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up
8801243 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8801244 its sort of a smart thing because i think the clinton delegations are going to leave denver with a high regard for the obama forces
8801245 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8801246 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8801247 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8801248 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8801249 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8801250 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8801251 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8801252 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8801253 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8801254 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8801255 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8801256 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8801257 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8801258 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8801259 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8801260 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8801261 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8801262 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8801263 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8801264 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8801265 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8801266 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8801267 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8801268 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8801269 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8801270 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8801271 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8801272 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour

8801287 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8801288 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8801289 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8801290 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8801291 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8801292 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8801293 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour

8801297 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8801298 stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8801299 god has given us each of us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions
8801300 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8801301 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8801302 saint augustine wondered about the stages of human development before birth how this related to the question of ensoulment and what it meant for life in the kingdom of god
8801303 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society
8801304 its not just a personal opinion that you came up with randomly
8801305 truly grave moral reasons not to advance narrow interests or partisan preferences
8801306 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8801307 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8801308 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8801309 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8801310 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8801311 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8801312 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8801313 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8801314 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8801315 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8801316 i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent
8801317 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8801318 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8801319 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8801320 with the rest of the world now slowing and the dollar off its lows the u s will be more reliant on domestic demand in coming quarters
8801321 since consumer spending is slowing down and the credit crunch is tightening its grip it is hard to foresee another quarter with such a robust gdp headline for some time
8801322 the experimental warhead section of the rocket hit its pre determined target with high accuracy at the firing range
8801323 relying on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a settlement of local conflicts
8801324 we would have expected to read something like this in the onion fortunately for us its true unfortunately for obama its true
8801325 weve done britneys sets and a whole bunch of rock shows but this was far more elaborate and complicated and we had to do it in far less time
8801326 the biggest challenge has been making sure we dont damage the playing field underneath

8801354 i had no idea that it would be the winter that tore apart our friendship forever
8801355 if only id known that everything that has happened since that winter was telegraphed in that conversation
8801356 in a way what gordon and i realized that morning was that some inevitable point was approaching for both of us after which nothing would ever be the same of course neither of us knew it until it was too late
8801357 finally i will get to hear how everything fell apart and donny and gordon ceased to be friends
8801358 well its going to be a sudden ending but at least i will get to know what the heck donny was moaning about all this time
8801359 every sign signal and background chatter indicates john mccain will pick tim pawlenty minnesotas governor as his running mate
8801360 all of the reliable indicators say that he will be
8801361 but when youre dealing with john mccain you can never be sure

8801364 its the light not the darkness that most frightens us
8801365 i think its the ethanol it mixes with the oil and attracts water in the tank and that gets into the engine it can also rust the tank
8801366 i can drain the fuel line and clean the fuel filter and nozzles but i cant get to the scooter for a few days im backed up
8801367 after you fix this whats to prevent my being back here after my next e10 fill up
8801368 im a journalist and im going to look into this
8801369 ill call you on the 9th or sooner if i can
8801370 has anyone out there with a two stroke engine had problems with the ethanol in the gas
8801371 if you have faith the size of a mustard seed you will say to the mountain move mountain and it will move
8801372 i will look at 2008 as the year in which members of a variety of groups that previously had been excluded from the presidential talent pool got included
8801373 its encouraging that we as a country are willing to look past a lot of old prejudices in deciding who can be a serious candidate for president and who cant
8801374 in a year with such a pivotal election before us it is important to find ways to bring the lofty issues facing our nation down to earth and make them accessible to the public who will be voting for our next president
8801375 michael nelson has a wealth of expertise and knows how to link our own daily life to the political issues we hear so much about on the news but may not truly understand
8801376 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
8801377 we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream
8801378 will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream
8801379 ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology
8801380 it was a deeply substantive speech full of policy detail full of people other than the candidate centered overwhelmingly on domestic economic anxiety
8801381 what he didnt do was give an airy abstract dreamy confection of rhetoric
8801382 if the rove republicans thought they were playing with a patsy they just got a reality check
8801383 i may not agree with all of his policies but i think his message of hope for our country means more
8801384 its hard to imagine there are people in this country that can not at least feel inspired by obama even if they do not plan to vote for him
8801385 ive said it before months and months ago i should say it again tonight this is a remarkable man at a vital moment america would be crazy to throw this opportunity away america must not throw this opportunity away
8801386 it doesnt matter what we do drill research alternative energy raise cafe standards in 2018 well still be using oil
8801387 even if we discovered a magic source of clean renewable energy tomorrow wed still be using a lot of oil because transitions of that magnitude take time
8801388 from a democratic perspective he made the argument for government something we havent heard in a while
8801389 moved into ample detail on what he wants to do with the economy and made the case for a failed bush mccain foreign policy
8801390 ive been looking for the details for a while and while not a wonky speech there was enough there there to hang your hat on
8801391 and perhaps most importantly he defended himself and put the screws to the republican party for the failure of the last eight years on the question of being ready to be commander in chief obama answered the question with a clarity and passion i havent seen from him yet
8801392 i have a dream today a dream deeply rooted in the american dream
8801393 when the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence
8801394 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief
8801395 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through
8801396 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two
8801397 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at
8801398 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for
8801399 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to
8801400 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century
8801401 now let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn
8801402 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8801403 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes
8801404 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the
8801405 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires
8801406 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8801407 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now
8801408 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it
8801409 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that
8801410 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the
8801411 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because
8801412 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our
8801413 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty
8801414 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is
8801415 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8801416 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont
8801417 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i
8801418 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8801419 what has it done or failed to do that fills you with dismay what is laudable what is ludicrous
8801420 power concedes nothing without demand it never has and never will
8801421 it just developed into a 2 7 million square foot facility
8801422 but this is the first time weve seen you hear in like ages youre never around
8801423 i seemed to have grab my boyfriends glasses honey can you get me mine
8801424 if i were to ask you to marry me would you
8801425 we are so happy and so relieved that it is quite a sight here with people laughing and crying at the same time
8801426 with all due respect a system that requires an insane person to first make a substantial showing of his own lack of mental capacity without the assistance of counsel or a mental health expert in order to obtain such assistance is by definition an insane system
8801427 right now first and foremost we want to thank everyone who got involved and we just hope and pray people wont forget about jeff because the fight is not over we got a break and we thank god for that but its still not over even though the stay was issued on issues of jeffs mental health i still think it is important we focus on the rest of the issues in his case and the law of parties
8801428 i hope no other family would have to endure what the foster and wood families have gone through jeffs case is so much like kenneths case that it is like a mirror image i remember thinking last summer that texas had already executed the killer and yet they wanted kenneth it is the same for jeff the killer has been executed what more does texas want jeff is not guilty of anything and wasnt even in the store where is justice in texas today it is sure not in killing jeff wood his execution should be stopped today
8801429 damp will be the weather yet hot the pyre in my backyard
8801430 so why not read the books and talk about them too
8801431 living at a remove from day to day coverage on tv and minute to minute chatter in washington can highlight certain trends and details that are easily lost in the ongoing wash of news
8801432 importante o torcedor sentir o prazer de jogar em casa
8801433 existe a id ia de colocar vans para levar os torcedores das esta es de metr para o est dio
8801434 we did a good job this year of understanding what we wanted to get out of it and what we wanted to accomplish we had a couple injuries that you would like to get through without but as a whole were better as a team from when we went to camp
8801435 clearly when the regular season starts it goes to another level
8801436 and as defending champs its a new challenge and were looking forward to it
8801437 if your catching hell dont hold it and if youre going through hell dont stop
8801438 you look at it and kind of wonder how close the refs were to blowing the whistle and stopping the play
8801439 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure
8801440 you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8801441 sen mccain would keep us on offense with terrorism and senator obama would put us back on defense
8801442 with appreciation for the spirit and dedication of all who are gathered here with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8801443 i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the future conduct of the roll call vote
8801444 all votes cast by the delegates will be counted and i move sen barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclimation as the nominee of the democratic party as the president of the united states
8801445 i love this and i thank you but we have important work to do here tonight
8801446 but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children and im grateful for the chance chelsea and i had to tell americans about the person we know and love
8801447 im not so grateful for the chance to speak in the wake of her magnificent address last night but ill do my best hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8801448 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8801449 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8801450 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8801451 at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea which is change in america doesnt start from the top down
8801452 it starts from the bottom up that change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things and so we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8801453 so will he be riding on the back of a donkey down auraria parkway to the pepsi center
8801454 real conservatives should vote for ron paul and get the gop back on track
8801455 have you idiots forgot that both parties are to blame for the mess we are in
8801456 sure rosen would have a job at any democrat newspaper
8801457 and lo the sky parted and he rode down from on high on the back of an eagle he rode and his countenance was as the sun down and before us he did alight the ground turned as spun gold as he placed his foot on the earth of the high city
8801458 and he looked upon us and blessed us and we shouted jubilee jubilee our saviour is here we did celebrate for many days for he was among us and we were blessed
8801459 do you people honestly believe that ranting about what you believe to be true is going to change anyones mind vote for your choice and let the cards fall where they may my vote is for obama because i want something different to happen with out government you cant talk me out of it just as i most likely can not talk you out of voting for johnny boy
8801460 having black lineage that goes unperceived does not make you the first black president the concept of whiteness and blackness is a social construct if in society someone is perceived to be white then they are white those who elected these past presidents were electing white male presidents not black presidents obama will be if he wins the first and only intentionally elected socially considered black president this distinction makes all the difference an american society has never intended to elect anyone other than whites males and thats all we have done so far
8801461 for conservatives seeing is believing while for liberals believing is seeing
8801462 youre lucky i didnt knock the f word out of you
8801463 we all know republicans love america they just hate half the people that live here
8801464 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us and yet we were willing to talk to the soviet union at a time they said we were going to wipe you off the planet
8801465 few will have the greatness to bend history itself but each of us can work to change a small portion of events and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation
8801466 mccain is like a grumpy elephant with no vision and a flip flopping memory there is a reason this elephant is always attacking without a postive message his trainers are rove amp schmidt at the circus we know what to expect at the mccains convention a grumpy elephant entwining his trunk with 2 rogue elephants in bush cheney with two cheering trainers in rove amp schmidt who are trying to sell the american people a 3 rd george bush term
8801467 thanks for another typical generalization by the oh so tolerent right douche
8801468 you republicans are sure getting slower as the days go on
8801469 barak won my heart and established himself as a duly adopted son of denver by correctly identifying our beloved football stadium as
8801470 but much of our current problems are a result of do nothing democratic congress
8801471 but much of our current problems are the result of 5 consecutive do nothing congresses
8801472 the only history hussein obama is making is managing to be the most inexperienced politician ever getting this close to the white house
8801473 my some of you are getting pretty excited here and are perhaps a bit naive regarding what obama could accomplish as prez
8801474 heck yes son go pick that lettuce and make some money just dont plan on making a living at it
8801475 the track record and the fact that since getting a slim majority in congress the liberals have had to deal with obstructions from conservatives in the face of initiatives and legislation with the support of the majority of americans
8801476 finally getting it right about georgia after the third time and taking mccains first stance
8801477 real conservatives should vote for ron paul and get the gop back on track
8801478 read time newsweek nwt the wall street journal business week the financial times salon com drudge
8801479 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8801480 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8801481 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8801482 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8801483 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8801484 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8801485 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8801486 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8801487 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8801488 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8801489 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8801490 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8801491 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8801492 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8801493 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8801494 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8801495 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8801496 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8801497 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8801498 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8801499 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8801500 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8801501 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8801502 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8801503 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8801504 the democrats have had 2 years of control of the congres and havent delivered either
8801505 more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8801506 give me power over your life liberty and property and ill make everything better ive got this great five year plan you see
8801507 i will do i will do i will do yet i can not tell you how exactly i will do this do do do
8801508 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach

8801516 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams

8801530 the amount being paid to the industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content that we own and control is far too small
8801531 we used to fool ourselves we used to think our content was perfect just exactly as it was we expected our business would remain blissfully unaffected even as the world of interactivity constant connection and file sharing was exploding and of course we were wrong how were we wrong by standing still or moving at a glacial pace we inadvertently went to war with consumers by denying them what they wanted and could otherwise find and as a result of course consumers won

8801583 ifrs represents a new chapter in u s public reporting requirements and with that a fundamental shift in how we view accounting and financial reporting financial executives of companies across all industry sectors will need to fully understand the impact ifrs will have on their organization including the potential costs and benefits
8801584 the impact ifrs will have on companies in each industry sector will vary depending on the issues unique to the sector some companies have significant regulatory and capital market considerations while others may have complex organizational structures that include multiple subsidiaries and joint venture relationships this series is intended to help financial executives understand the key issues affecting their industry so they can make informed decisions on when and how to embark on conversion to ifrs in a more measured way
8801585 no question about it a successful ifrs conversion project will involve not only understanding the technical accounting and financial reporting issues but also issues around internal processes and controls regulatory statutory and management reporting technology infrastructure and organizational issues such as tax treasury and cash management legal and human resources

8801611 it makes no sense to offer the buyout program to an employee whose essential expertise could only be replaced by hiring from outside the company
8801612 sometimes the dead wood doesnt take the buyouts and good people do

8801618 we basically had no choice but to go back into the room and accept
8801619 people thought we were nuts buying it it had railroad tracks old shipyards it was not an attractive piece of property it was pretty bad
8801620 i think it helped when i went to their house because they have a magnificent house and it gave a little bit more credibility driving in that these people might be real

8801633 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8801634 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8801635 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8801636 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8801637 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
8801638 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
8801639 this is the best i have felt since early in houston
8801640 i have played decent games where i have not felt good
8801641 i felt i sporadically made plays and things lucked into happening tonight i was in control of what was going on and that hasnt happened in a long time
8801642 when the regular season starts its a whole new ballgame
8801643 we know that is it nice to win the games yeah but it doesnt mean anything weve had good records in preseason weve had bad records in preseason what counts is how you play in the regular season
8801644 we still have a lot of work to do and we have to get better
8801645 the preseason is over and kansas city is coming in we have to be ready nobody is waiting for us we had a bad day but we have to put that behind us there are no concerns we have to move forward and move on

8801657 i just wish that the needs of the relatives namely a thirst for the truth and for justice would be attended to rather than an alleged hunger for money

8801678 my compliments on a superb and extremely helpful web site to the best of my knowledge its only one of its kind that provides so much detailed information in one place for the clean air conscious traveler as a business editor for a florida daily newspaper i know quality of life and particularly air quality are critical factors for many high tech companies when they are scouting for locations to expand or start a new enterprise your site and links provide an outstanding portal into this expanding field of clean air consciousness keep up the excellent work
8801679 your site is outstanding and very informative i live here in la and have been hoping to one day find an area with cleaner air in particular i had been looking at bellingham and enjoyed reading of your experiences there your writing style is excellent and a real pleasure to read of the many sites out there a truly useful site looking forward to reading about your next journey towards finding a clean air location
8801680 i came across your blog and found your site to be a very interesting read thanks for what you do to bring clean healthy air issues to light
8801681 your blog on the clean air and your trip to the monterey peninsula is wonderfully written bravo to you on a fine piece of writing and with great photos

8801684 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8801685 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8801686 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for those who are called to the cause of peace
8801687 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8801688 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8801689 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
8801690 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
8801691 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
8801692 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8801693 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8801694 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
8801695 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8801696 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8801697 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8801698 look bro we are reaching if not already reached peak oil peak coal and peak natural gas
8801699 if thats the case how come so many people have died and we dont know how many more will be showing symptoms
8801700 the ball fell through and consumer confidence is right down the tubes with respect to government and companies like maple leaf its absolutely outrageous
8801701 i think that it should be investigated at the nursing home but i think the plant in which all this has developed it certainly should be checked into very very thoroughly
8801702 its affecting more and more people than you can possibly imagine
8801703 school lunches are going to have to be re thought hospitals cafeteria this is a major major consumer issue
8801704 they have to find out what caused this so that it can never happen again
8801705 if they dont find out how do i know that next month its not going to happen again or with some other products more care has to be put into how our food is prepared
8801706 it is intended to be divided equally as the minister noted
8801707 we recognize that from one day to the next the absolute amount of time on a particular task may not be exactly equal
8801708 the important message for people is that if you have the symptoms that are associated with listeriosis that you take precautionary actions as you see fit in terms of seeing a health professional or public health person
8801709 because we knew we had made those products we had removed them from sale when the recall was initiated
8801710 we executed the recall we did it effectively efficiently and the products that are now being recalled were prepared and sold prior to the recall
8801711 if theres a problem with a product we pull the product off the floor and begin calling our customers and typically within 24 hours everyones been called
8801712 the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history
8801713 people tell me to call back in two months four months six months when they will be looking at this problem he says perplexed when i call back i get people telling me how glad they are that i called but my close ratio is low and my sales cycles are way too long whats going on
8801714 your goal has to be to maintain your poise and get past that first fifteen to thirty seconds of the initial call which is always going to be a little bumpy
8801715 actually youre trying to discover if this person has experienced a trigger event
8801716 it looked like it was purposeful it was going very fast
8801717 i dont know if he the driver fell asleep but there were no brakes
8801718 therefore the committee felt because they were contentious and bringing division to the community they should be excluded from the discussion
8801719 you could not have glenrosa you could not have shannon lake or lakeview heights what im saying is that could also exclude gellatly or boucherie or green bay
8801720 it will create a different kind of division with people feeling disenfranchised especially after we have closed the process and submitted all of these names its going to create more concern in my opinion with people asking why the process was run this way to begin with
8801721 police located and seized approximately 400 marijuana plants as well as seven firearms
8801722 a hydro bypass was located at the scene indicating the theft of electricity
8801723 the three aircraft inbound to vancouver are still in europe
8801724 as a result the three flights that we expected to arrive later this afternoon will not arrive
8801725 were just starting discussions with all the other airlines that fly to the same destinations in vancouver to see if they have space and can accommodate some of the folks that do arrive at the airport
8801726 we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8801727 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8801728 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8801729 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8801730 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8801731 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time
8801732 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8801733 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists that actually attacked us on 9 11
8801734 you know john mccain likes to say he will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8801735 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8801736 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8801737 doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8801738 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8801739 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again

8801775 the agreement clearly specifies what is required and since sterling has failed to timely provide the proper evidence of payment it appears the mine is in danger of falling out of compliance with federal regulations
8801776 sunshines representatives are currently investigating what we believe are additional compliance issues with federal and state law as well as what may well be additional material breaches
8801777 sterling has failed to protect our property and this raises concerns about their ability to pay contractors and their solvency to maintain the infrastructure of the mine

8801802 he gave the best argument offered thus far on the third day of the convention for barack obama he gave a comprehensive view domestically and internationally it wasnt his endorsement tonight that mattered but what he did do is he set a theme restoring the american dream at home and americas leadership abroad

8801818 women and lazy children like yourself require to be sheltered from the wind as for me i am a man and i am not frightened with the cold
8801819 i well know that you are stronger than i am and for that very reason should you take care of yourself so that you may help me that am so weak
8801820 for i am here to guard and watch over you
8801821 have obeyed your commands there was not a single one of them who did not send you oh sovereign master some victims but i challenge any of them to do what i can
8801822 i well know that you are one of my most devoted worshippers
8801823 that the grand reigning duke of f and his lady are both zealous christians faithful and true and you are also aware that they have a daughter lovely as the sun whom they idolize what a joy to me to make this beautiful creature die by inches to wither that flower in all its youth and freshness and to sow despair in the hearts of her parents and so deliver them up to your powerful temptations would it not be a masterly stroke to kill them also after two or three months of cruel sufferings what would it cost you my lord to impel them to destroy their own life
8801824 well then give me my reward my lord it is now a week since the princess began to suffer and no one is able to discover the cause of her complaint and still less can they find the remedies to effect her cure
8801825 are you not afraid that some one will discover it
8801826 no my lord because the spell which binds her consists in the existence of an enormous toad which lies concealed under a broken statue which has been abandoned and cast away in a corner of the garden of the ducal residence so long as this toad is not destroyed the sickness will follow its course and the princess will die
8801827 this that you tell me pleases me greatly bazzioti and i desire to have frequent and exact accounts given me of what happens i give you my thanks for what you do
8801828 take this alms poor child and ask our dear lord to grant that my daughter may be restored to health the prayers of an innocent child are very pleasing to god and will assuredly obtain the boon from him which he refuses to us
8801829 poor child perhaps you do not know that the first physicians of the land and the cleverest have despaired of effecting a cure
8801830 i certainly was not aware of this but all i know is that i have come here expressly to cure the princess and cure her i will
8801831 my lady we must lose all hope now our beloved daughter will assuredly die
8801832 i met him on my return from the church and on asking him to pray to god for our child he replied that he had come to cure her
8801833 perchance are you an angel sent by god to comfort us
8801834 yes that has been the only object of my journey and i have walked the whole way and day and night for a month
8801835 so this is the flower that is to wither away
8801836 i have come to save your daughter and save her i will
8801837 i swear by my ducal crown that if you save my daughter you shall be her brother
8801838 i no longer feel that heavy weight here here on my chest
8801839 oh my god may you be praised cried the duchess shedding a torrent of tears my sophia is saved
8801840 do you hear what your mother says my sister rise up for now you are cured
8801841 in the name of the all powerful god of heaven i adopt as my own son this orphan who has shed so much happiness on our house do you consent to this duchess
8801842 no no i cruelly abandoned him when he was poor and weak i should not now that he is rich and in position go and seek him when like izar i shall have performed some generous noble act then will i go to him ask his pardon and i know that he will pardon me he is so good i shall go up to the accursed mountain and listen for some secret spoken in the conventicle and then i will set to work
8801843 shall i be less than my brother he so weak i so strong he so gentle and meek i so brave and hardy no no i will ascend the rugged mountain and challenge all the dangers which may beset me until i attain to my end at any cost
8801844 what became of all your fine promises you deceitful one
8801845 the princess was cured and her parents far from thinking of destroying themselves through despair each day are happier and idolize more and more their child and my direst enemy
8801846 as i see that you are of no use to me in this world go and await me in the next
8801847 ha so here we have another inquisitive mortal it appears
8801848 do you perchance think that any one has ever been able to boast that he has derided me with impunity
8801849 yes i do seeing that my brother has done so with a good result
8801850 oh oh so you are brother to the one who saved the life of the italian princess
8801851 well if i interest you i on my part thoroughly despise you
8801852 you say this because you are not aware who i am
8801853 but nevertheless that is no proof that you despise me
8801854 sole child of the king of youth oiseens dark eyes in dreams have haunted me oiseens song streams all day have daunted me i who scatheless of love long have vaunted me ah now know his searching truth

8801858 from a scientific perspective green carbon accounting and protection of the natural forests in all nations should become part of a comprehensive approach to solving the climate change problem
8801859 any impacts of any human land use activity that reduces the carbon stocks of a forested landscape relative to its natural carbon carrying capacity
8801860 to recognise the differences between the ecological characteristics of natural forests and industrialised forests especially plantations these differences include the higher biodiversity ecosystem resilience and carbon residence time of natural forests

8801883 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
8801884 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
8801885 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
8801886 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
8801887 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
8801888 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
8801889 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
8801890 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
8801891 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
8801892 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
8801893 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
8801894 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
8801895 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
8801896 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
8801897 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
8801898 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
8801899 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
8801900 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
8801901 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
8801902 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
8801903 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
8801904 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
8801905 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
8801906 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
8801907 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
8801908 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
8801909 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
8801910 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
8801911 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
8801912 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
8801913 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
8801914 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
8801915 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
8801916 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
8801917 because you are a little shit failure unworthy slut etc
8801918 we are waiting for the appointment of the new chairman but not hoping to resign at this point
8801919 we were appointed by the chairman in may 2007 for two years and are contracted with the board till april 2009 our appointments were made purely on merits and therefore see no reasons to vacate the post
8801920 however if the new chairman wants his own men as new selectors the pcb would require to give either one month notice or the salary
8801921 it is very quiet over here now the cricket board is in mess the captain shoaib malik is busy with his advertisement shooting in india no body is aware about shoaib akhtar and mohammad asif
8801922 text message the obama campaign and their friends and to make phone calls from specially tailored call sheets as part of an unprecedented effort to mobilize voters and get nonvoters to register
8801923 a lot of fans can get real close that baseballs technically still in play and some spectator interference calls where fans reach over and touch the ball it happens in like a millisecond and its almost impossible for an umpire who is a couple hundred feet away to make the absolute certain call every time
8801924 just for it to become a crutch and for umpires to develop the mental attitude that ok no big deal weve got an instant replay if we mess something up and thats the wrong mindset for an umpire
8801925 the richmond police department encourages officers to use non traditional transportation foot patrol bike patrol and dirt bike patrol and in this case it allowed the officers to make observations they would not normally have seen from a patrol car
8801926 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough

8801928 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but it is not the change that america needs

8801934 if george bush had listened to joe biden instead of donald rumsfeld the history of the past seven years would have been very different we might have prevented 9 11
8801935 the risk has increased significantly since the road was closed on sunday it is dangerous for people to get near the slip area they shouldnt be walking on the beach to get around it
8801936 a much larger landslip could come down very quickly bringing thousands of tonnes of debris onto the road and affect properties
8801937 our advice from geotechnical experts is that cracks in the rock face and continuing movement could mean a huge landslip will happen
8801938 its still missing the magnetometers so its still a system that needs that ir strip to figure out where it is whereas the darwin is completely self contained
8801939 if im not mistaken there were a number of postings and blogs and weve been hearing through our friends and family so to speak that the wii motionplus was a response to the darwin
8801940 we dont expect any interruptions to electricity supply however we are currently moving some additional equipment to the site as well as inspecting the transmission lines in the vicinity via helicopter to ensure that there are no other instances like this one
8801941 the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us we decided years ago to build a game console that offers much greater functionality the playstation 3 has an enormous processor it is gradually emerging as the central server in our users homes
8801942 the wii is a well made device that has found a new target group for a while we held the same target group with the singstar karaoke game but perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue playstation games are rather designed for those who play a lot
8801943 not for as long as i live it will certainly take some time
8801944 even after three weeks in the largest fire in over 100 years we realize that we all came at out of it nobody was killed there were no significant injuries to speak of and while 38 families did lose their homes which was a terrible tragedy for the most part the larger community really was unscathed other than going through the tremendous inconvenience of the fire period
8801945 we always live in fear of mudslides around here i mean we have exceptional rain we have problems and thats normal now with the hillsides and the loss of vegetation that just magnifies that
8801946 the only bits of anatomy many young men exercise are their fingers and wrists
8801947 no sniggering at the back please im talking about computer games
8801948 all those leisure hours we used to fill with climbing trees or kicking balls have gone because were all too busy clicking on consoles with eyes glued to a screen
8801949 theres a tennis court down the road but instead of getting fresh air they were wearing out our carpet their thumb joints and my patience
8801950 the only bits of anatomy many young men exercise are their fingers and wrists
8801951 no sniggering at the back please im talking about computer games
8801952 i would argue that if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top 3 4 percent in this country
8801953 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
8801954 some of the richest people ive known in my life are the most unhappy rich should be defined by a home a good job an education and the ability to hand our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one we inherited
8801955 jag ska bara g och lyssna lite p radio i bilen
8801956 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
8801957 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
8801958 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
8801959 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
8801960 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
8801961 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
8801962 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
8801963 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
8801964 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
8801965 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
8801966 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
8801967 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
8801968 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
8801969 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
8801970 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
8801971 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
8801972 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
8801973 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
8801974 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
8801975 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
8801976 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
8801977 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
8801978 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
8801979 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
8801980 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
8801981 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
8801982 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
8801983 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
8801984 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
8801985 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
8801986 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
8801987 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
8801988 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
8801989 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
8801990 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8801991 well do you remember the baby whale being borned on the tv

8802012 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that daddy yankee and mccain the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war

8802027 because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from you make a big election about small things
8802028 that ladies and gentlemen is how you win elections you gather a group of middle aged middle class middle income voters who remember with longing an easier time and you talk to them about family and american values and character

8802050 i still dont care who it is so long as theyre not republican thats not continuation we can afford
8802051 rose i think mccain is the republican brand i dont think those individual name polls mean much
8802052 while mccain has a 4 point lead in the latest poll the same survey found that florida voters prefer a generic democratic presidential candidate to a generic republican by a 44 to 39 percent margin
8802053 how exactly do you take mccain out of the equation hes their guy
8802054 thats what i dont get ivb how can it be even that close a race given the candidates is nearly half of our nation complete ignorant morons that they think mccain is the best option for this country
8802055 besides can you really take the trash out of the republican what kind of people are modern repubs what do they identify with the bigotry the greediness the hate the fear mongering the war hawking
8802056 rose i read those differences as people who just dont like the specific guy old guy black guy

8802061 staging a convention during a major natural disaster would be a public relations challenge for either political party
8802062 still we have to worry about the hurricanes effect on this market
8802063 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant
8802064 the environment of sparse capacity means that every barrel of oil lost to the marketplace will be felt particularly as the northern hemispheres winter is just around the corner
8802065 my sense is that there is still one more round of tightening in store and the central bank wants to be on top of things

8802171 tawaran yang benar benar menarik tapi prioritas saya tetap bermain bersama getafe sebagai sikap respek terhadap para fans dan klub yang telah memberikan kesempatan kepada saya untuk bermain di primera division

8802178 we never did i think i would remember jennies fist connecting with a part of my body or a part of my face
8802179 it just goes to show you how people will lie
8802180 there is a lot of speculation going on when we are able to we will issue facts we are not able to go into the building so we do not know what if anything is inside
8802181 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8802182 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time
8802183 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 of the time
8802184 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8802185 in military terms he attacked from a defensive position like henry at agincourt like reagan against carter
8802186 they could do this in a day and a half and save millions of dollars
8802187 news divisions are always complaining about spending too much money send someone to pakistan instead
8802188 obama doesnt come out here in a skin tight outfit and boa constrictor
8802189 whose idea was it to give the speech in front of the parthenon
8802190 we will remember this night as long as we live
8802191 the risks associated with antipsychotic use in patients with dementia generally outweigh the potential benefits and in this patient group use of antipsychotic drugs should be avoided whenever possible
8802192 in view of its size it is most likely that it was either from the side of a cake or from the top of a single tier cake a highly unusual and probably inedible collectors item
8802193 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8802194 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8802195 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8802196 in the past for me if you do start doing that it doesnt work out particularly well
8802197 the guys that im playing are not guys that im 100 percent expected to beat if theres a chance i can lose the match youre going to take it very seriously
8802198 theres no point in looking ahead you understand whats going on in the draw and which half of the draw youre in and where the top seeds are
8802199 but it doesnt make me start looking into semis quarter finals because i only made the quarter finals of a slam once at wimbledon this year
8802200 saya pikir mustahil baginya hargreaves untuk dapat bermain bersama timnas inggris itulah penilaian saya partai nanti malam lawan zenit adalah pertandingan pertamanya di musim ini lagipula saya tidak akan memainkannya dengan penuh itu tergantung dari kondisinya nanti di saat jeda tiba tapi saya yakin ia tidak akan dapat bermain lebih dari 60 menit
8802201 saya pikir sangat tidak mungkin bagi fabio capello untuk menurunkannya sebab itu terlalu berisiko ia terlebih dahulu harus melalui proses recovery saat laga lawan kroasia pun sangat sulit kesempatan bagi hargreaves untuk bermain untuk dapat bermain di laga seperti itu pemain yang diturunkan haruslah benar benar berada dalam kondisi yang fit
8802202 pelatih bernd schuster dan direktur sport predrag mijatovic menginginkan si pemain robinho tetap tinggal bersama tim saya pun yakin ia akan tetap di sini
8802203 sejauh ini skuad kami sudah komplet tidak mungkin bagi kami untuk merekrut seorang pemain baru yang lebih baik dibanding yang kami miliki
8802204 masih tersisa dua tahun dalam kontrak robinho karenanya dalam dua musim ke muka ia tetap merupakan pemain kami
8802205 your friend on twitter have you ever met this person or is this one of your cyber dork friends
8802206 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition
8802207 ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8802208 i could see improvement in his body his conditioning and mobility
8802209 i didnt see any signs of effects from the surgery
8802210 he told me that he is ready to comeback to l a to start playing full court drills
8802211 john mccain wants to continue george bushs tax cuts for the wealthiest americans i want to give a tax cut to working people i admired senator mccain when he said he could not in good conscience support the bush tax cuts
8802212 but now as the republican nominee hes fully embraced them he wants to give a permanent tax cut to the wealthiest americans who dont need them and didnt ask for them while working people are struggling and for all his talk about fiscal responsibility hes proposed 400 billion in tax cuts without any word about how hell pay for them thats exactly the kind of attitude that has shifted the burden on to the middle class and mortgaged our childrens future on a mountain of debt
8802213 when i finally make marketing manager then i will be happy
8802214 it was life changing for us we probably would still be working as corporates and we might still be in japan
8802215 we didnt feed the business the way we could have in terms of expanding
8802216 weve learnt from that in catering for the growth of the business
8802217 we had to explain were not selling fruit we are actually providing a cost effective employee benefit that employers should take advantage of
8802218 when youve got a just in time system and people dont tell you whats happening it makes it pretty hard
8802219 each week we tell people what they are going to get in the mix and why we communicate very well with our customers and set expectations with them
8802220 we recognised early on that we needed to be a national company pretty much all of the copycats are people who have just got one van and can only deliver in their local area
8802221 its been something that has been tempting but weve just focused on fruit
8802222 i primi 100 giorni del governo secondo il financial times deutschland testo tradotto integralmente
8802223 i feel like i could take on the world and i think the hardest part of this challenge was staying in the same pose for 10 minutes
8802224 its a real shame that i look at the photos and instead of going oh my god im naked i go oh my god i need to get to the gym
8802225 i dont even have butterflies in my stomach bring it on
8802226 what the naysayers have never understood is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8802227 see thats why i love him he sounds just like you
8802228 it usually takes about three or four years for these claims to work their way through the system and get them to the stage where parties might want to settle or you get a result so thats why were only beginning to see the fruits of these cases now
8802229 it seemed to me that in that case there was strong evidence of wrong doing and it was inevitable they would get a successful outcome whether that be in judgement or settlement so there are no surprises in the result or the quantum
8802230 fraud on the market principle that has formed the basis of successful results for shareholder class actions in the us
8802231 that argument was put in the aristocrat case and everybody was waiting for the decision now the wait will continue but we think it has a good chance of ultimate success and we intend to run that theory in several of our cases
8802232 we in ireland cant figure out why you people are even bothering to hold an election in the united states on one side you had a pants wearing female lawyer married to another lawyer who cant seem to keep his pants on who just lost a long and heated primary against a lawyer who goes to the wrong church who is married to yet another lawyer who doesnt even like the country her husband wants to run now on the other side you have a nice old war hero whose name starts with the appropriate mc terminology married to a good looking younger woman who owns a beer distributorship
8802233 heck its something understood by accountants so it cant be that difficult
8802234 we have seen a small improvement in consumer confidence in august but this should not be seen as a turnaround in core sentiment
8802235 the improvement could be down to a number of recent factors which are mostly of short term influence

8802239 in a society when we very rarely let our mobile phones out of our sight its quite amazing to think that for a lot of us the minute we jump in the shower someone might be checking up on us
8802240 what this confirms is that the rba will be taking a very measured approach to easing policy a cut of 25 basis points looks a done deal next week but further rate cuts from there have just become a whole lot less certain
8802241 new home sales fell by 24 5 in western australia 11 7 in new south wales 11 2 south australia and 7 2 in victoria queensland was the only state to experience a rise in sales increasing by 13 4
8802242 budgeted sales levels are well down on expectations and that runs the clear risk of the next step being a shedding of labour in the industry
8802243 the imminent move to lower interest rates is a welcome first step to a much needed home building recovery
8802244 there doesnt seem to be anything in the contractual arrangements to guarantee that those jobs are sustainable in any way
8802245 if governments are shelling out billions of dollars youd hope it was to create more sustainable secure jobs rather than jobs in unskilled areas where theres likely to be high turnover and the jobs are less secure
8802246 some people will argue that call centre jobs are not the sort of jobs that government should be supporting because they are so footloose
8802247 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8802248 we have reduced flow but we have not stopped operations
8802249 we have already closed the port at port kaiser and the railroad has also been closed but the plant is still up and running
8802250 they have sent most of us home and the plant is operating on low power
8802251 so renowned for its significant contribution to strengthening regional unity cooperation and self determination
8802252 i have always argued that the success of the regional integration movement depends critically on effective communication primarily the dissemination of vital information and the transport of people goods and services across the expanse of the caribbean sea
8802253 that the exchange of relevant information is a pre condition for the sustainable development of the region which is the fundamental goal of all regional movements from the very beginning and more recently of the federation of the west indies and the csme
8802254 he is so caught up with his own personal aggrandizement and thirst for regional power that he has no idea of what is happening in the towns and villages of trinidad and tobago
8802255 we must go the polls now and hear from the people who are being affected by crime dengue floods etc
8802256 the implementation of the epa must therefore be undertaken within the framework aimed at developing our capacity to participate more effectively in the international trade in goods and services
8802257 we have to look to a co ordinated approach to utilising all donor resources in our effort to build our trade capacity we however are conscious of the distinct role of the eu in providing development support mainly grant aid over many years estimated at 530 million euros under the lome conventions and 224 million euros
8802258 nobody blank manning or any such thing we never asked anybody to sign anything you know
8802259 we are putting together a coalition of the willing it is those who are willing to go in this direction who will come to the table
8802260 one hundred years later the negro is still languishing in the corners of american society and finds himself an exile in his own land
8802261 america has given the negro people a bad check which has come back marked insufficient funds
8802262 now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of gods children now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood
8802263 there will be neither rest nor tranquillity in america until the negro is granted his citizenship rights the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges
8802264 oh the gop is just being genial about the obama nomination to seem less waspy more tolerant
8802265 he is embracing the fact that when given the chance to make his case to an audience barack obama succeeds by selling himself and his vision
8802266 that was enough to sell several thousand copies of his dreams from my father well before he was nationally known that was enough four years ago to capture a national convention in the way an unknown politician never previously had remember ronald reagan had been a fairly well known actor and tv presence well before his 1964 speech in support of barry goldwater
8802267 one under was a good score today with the wind and the soft greens
8802268 this was ok one over is by no means out of this tournament
8802269 all reports suggest he is working well i was following the winner last start but couldnt keep up with him on the bend once he picked up the bridle he charged to the line from barrier one on saturday i am hoping to have him a little closer to the speed
8802270 it was a good pick up ride last start and i am happy to be on him again we planned to lead last start but that obviously didnt work out as planned we will attempt to lead again he is a better horse when he is allowed to bowl along in front at his own leisure
8802271 i won a race on him last campaign but havent ridden him this time in i think at his second start over a distance with his light weight he looks well placed he like his stable mate basto man likes to be out in front doing his own thing and hopefully we are still there at the finish
8802272 he has been consistent of late but runs into an in form horse in elliotto we should get a good run from his inside barrier and we will be running on strongly
8802273 the stable is going well and they have also had a good week this horse should have won last start we got held up at a crucial stage of the race but i still thought wed win
8802274 he is drawn to get the right run and looks a good chance
8802275 this young horse did everything right last start and i expect his rate of improvement to continue he is another one of my rides to have drawn well i expect him to go well
8802276 he went really well in the trial and he needed that hit out he is working strongly and i believe this horse he has a bit of a future
8802277 he has plenty of weight but he is a nice horse that will be better suited over more ground
8802278 i thought her last effort was really good she just wanted to run around a little when i asked her to go and if she runs a little straighter on saturday she should be in the finish
8802279 we were just held up hopelessly for a run last start and the race was all over by the time we found clear galloping room
8802280 he is a nice old horse that was scratched from the coolgardie cup because of a wide draw which we have to overcome in the farnley
8802281 he is a very consistent horse that i have had a bit of luck on he is doing everything right and this looks to be a good race for him
8802282 australian jockeys are among the lowest paid in the world they ride because they love the sport but they deserve basic protections
8802283 thats why we are asking for a small proportion of the racing industrys prize pool to be set aside for the jockeys who put their lives on the line when they saddle up
8802284 under our plan one per cent of race money would be directed to the aja
8802285 australian jockeys are taking this issue very seriously it would be a shame to see it disrupt something like the spring carnival
8802286 horse racing is a dangerous industry 89 per cent of jockeys have suffered at least one fall during their career that requires medical attention however most jockeys are not highly paid in fact more than 50 per cent of jockeys earn less than 50 000 per year
8802287 in the past nine years jockey numbers have declined 43 per cent if jockeys are not provided basic protections more of them will leave the sport putting the ongoing viability of the industry at risk
8802288 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8802289 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it
8802290 yes we must provide more ladders for success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair but we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and a make a child do homework that farhters must take more responsibility to provide love and guidance to their children
8802291 ya know john mccain says hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8802292 even the bush administration even after we learned that iraq has 79 billion dollars in surplus while we are walling in deficit john mccain stand alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war thats not the judgement we need that wont keep america safe
8802293 if you dont have any fresh ideals then you use stale tactics to scare voters you make a big election about small things
8802294 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me it has been about you change doesnt come from washington change comes to washington
8802295 oh fuck johnny were gonna loose hes not just one of the greatest orators on the planet he actually does have a plan
8802296 up until now weve given magnesium sulfate only to prevent pre term birth or to prevent preeclampsia
8802297 this study combined with two previous studies suggests that giving magnesium before early pre term birth could be beneficial
8802298 im emotionally kind of a middle of the road guy i know what to expect
8802299 anybody running is going to say something they wish theyd have kept
8802300 what went through my mind the work has just begun its not partying time partying time will be after he wins the presidency officially we have begun the race
8802301 i may be somewhat emotional myself because it is history and anytime you make history well i may get teary eyed i knew the time would come but i never thought i would see it in my lifetime
8802302 to witness it upfront it will bring tears to your eye its a monumental thing im not subject to break down all the way but im subject to break down
8802303 the fate of the clayton county school system is now in the hands of the voters
8802304 through the elections to replace these four board members they can send a clear signal that the kind of behavior that has led to this ruling and the systems loss of accreditation will not be tolerated
8802305 i cant believe the state of georgia would allow adult actions to penalize children
8802306 my daughter has been getting college invitations in the mail every day even from harvard now who knows kids dont understand that as a parent im having a hard time understanding this
8802307 to turn and look the other way and grant accreditation to a school system that does not deserve it
8802308 donors will receive reports and attend lectures but they wont belong to the institute
8802309 they will have nothing to do with its direction and no economist worth their salt would take that kind of direction anyway we will bring in people from all over the world with all different approaches
8802310 sen obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8802311 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8802312 i personally live about 10 miles from the plant and i felt it
8802313 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
8802314 it shook my house i thought my house was falling down on top of me thats how hard the vibration was
8802315 the bottom line is that to build this water plant the taxpayers are getting soaked
8802316 the need to complete important projects like the water plant has not diminished
8802317 we cant sit back and let others worry about the future
8802318 let us give our nation a leader who has heard this clarion call and will help us achieve the change we need
8802319 the material that was supposed to be destroyed was already superseded and had been replaced
8802320 there is no risk to the security of the weapon system and no possibility of an inadvertent launch as a result of this being taken from the weapon facility
8802321 they are not obviously working missile alert duties until the investigation is complete
8802322 they dont have the strength and the power they once did because of the line people
8802323 its a different generation theyre not as smart about how they involve themselves in supporting the family
8802324 has less of a talent pool to pull from because of ethnic neighborhoods disappearing
8802325 they are a shell of what the organization was years ago
8802326 do they get as much respect no but everybody is surviving
8802327 the only time ive ever heard that is in the papers
8802328 you ask anybody about me we straighten out a lot of beefs a lot of things
8802329 the mob is all about opportunity any chance to make money they are going to take it
8802330 carmens downfall is he was a good friend of this guy and he never suspected this guy would do this to him
8802331 is not recalling a product that it did not make and sell
8802332 they wouldnt be able to be in business if they did that
8802333 we are working with the supplier and cpsc and are directing store managers to remove product identified in the cpsc press release from store shelves and initiating a register block to prevent sale
8802334 in addition we are in the process of removing this product from sale at walmart com
8802335 be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont mind
8802336 no digas lo que haces sino haz lo que dices
8802337 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8802338 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8802339 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8802340 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8802341 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8802342 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve experienced in the history of humankind
8802343 not only in the heat of this election but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country
8802344 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8802345 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8802346 i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8802347 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8802348 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8802349 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8802350 to end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
8802351 not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8802352 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8802353 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8802354 we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
8802355 the list of artists and contributors who have graced the pages of arkitip now reads like a whos who of popular culture many of which received exposure in arkitip long before the mainstream took notice
8802356 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8802357 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8802358 let me spell out exactly what that change will mean if i am president
8802359 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8802360 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8802361 a misleading speech that was fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8802362 people had wanted him to be strong and lay out the argument for whats going on for the american people
8802363 thats what hes doing theres no wimpy guy up there
8802364 now to him who is able to do immeasurable more than all we ask or imagine
8802365 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8802366 it is easier to sell an existing client a new product than to find a new client
8802367 the ec has today notified the wto that it will appeal the panel reports on the banana cases brought by ecuador and the us

8802374 i can confirm that the aruba refinery is at slightly reduced rates
8802375 its impossible to tell the story of martinique without talking about rhum
8802376 our unique distillation methods and the distinctive flavors they produce are at the core of what makes martinique such a wonderful place and certainly its a big part of what attracts thousands of visitors to the island each year
8802377 los cient ficos nos aseguran que los seres humanos no podemos vivir sin agua y ni siquiera lo intentamos

8802381 mfe legal will be contacting you separately on this matter as we have concerns over the use of this consent condition
8802382 even when the council offered to pay for the tests itself mfe continued to use lawyers to try and stop them
8802383 we were always recognising that there could be people that were affected and that was what motivated our actions
8802384 the parliamentary commissioner for the environment suggested another thing we couldve done was a review of the consent but we were trying to deal with the potential issue
8802385 all we were seeking was reassurance that it wasnt a problem
8802386 its hard to stop a kid walking around and being nosy
8802387 some of these labs have highly toxic fumes and by products
8802388 there are of course specific health concerns when children have been exposed to p and it is necessary to undertake medical checks and blood toxin screening to ensure their health has not been compromised
8802389 its crucial because without it we wouldnt have been able to continue to participate in the air new zealand cup
8802390 it certainly means we can get on and focus on the competition but we still have our other battles ahead of us
8802391 effectively the nzru will be paying for the players payments
8802392 we dont want the competition to be disrupted and tasman withdrawing could have impacted on other provincial unions
8802393 im always doing something and im always on the go i hate being sick in bed

8802408 that unidentified man is charlie hershel he went to upenn and lives in ny he is 100
8802409 ill talk to the prime minister about this later today with the concrete evidence that she will know that these allegations are vile malevolent malicious and wrong
8802410 im going to talk to the prime minister and my full considerations will be subsequent to my talks with her
8802411 in my view hes not fit to be the foreign minister helen clark should act and she should act decisively to stand him down
8802412 it was clear to me then there were two quite different points of view at that point it becomes a matter between mr glenn and mr peters and the news media it is not a matter for me
8802413 thats what we were laughing about two in a row whoo
8802414 i was just kind of looking in one zone for a pitch to hit
8802415 you always want to be in that spot to be able to drive in the winning run any time you can get a hit like that its fun
8802416 weve been through some tough times the last month and a half we didnt play well or swing the bat well thats part of it tonight we got some big hits thats contagious when everybody is struggling at the same time thats contagious too
8802417 i know hes always going to give me a good at bat and thats all you can ask for when a guy comes off the bench cold
8802418 hes had success this year and confidence grows from that
8802419 were on a long road trip and weve been battling things a lot ourselves so were just trying to figure out how to do a little better job on the road trip
8802420 we know what happens here with us and the as its always a battle its always good baseball two teams that play the game the right way hustle bust their tails
8802421 this increase seen with heated seats is unlikely to be a significant issue unless you are sitting in a car for a long period of time on a regular basis with the heater on
8802422 but these are the types of things men should be considering if they want to have a baby but are having trouble conceiving
8802423 idk go find a map or something how should i know
8802424 naomi i a spus lui vladimir c t de mult iube te ea brazilia i c t de mult i ar dori s se stabileasc acolo a a c el i a cump rat un apartament i i a spus c este un dar pentru ea l vor folosi c nd se vor afla mpreun n brazilia

8802426 los cient ficos anderson hyde han descubierto que las personas que poseen un gato en casa sufren m s estr s que quienes eligen un perro
8802427 una compa a neozelandesa ha realizado un estudio donde se demuestra que ver un pordiosero por la calle puede producir considerables porcentajes de estr s en un infante
8802428 una empresa cervecera ha publicado los resultados de una investigaci n que prueba cient ficamente que quien bebe un refresco cualquiera a partir de las 10 de la noche sufre m s estr s que quien ingiere cerveza a la misma hora
8802429 esa marcha logr mucho al disminuir por la protesta ese tipo de il citos as como otros delitos
8802430 desgraciadamente el error fue no darle seguimiento a las protestas lo reconocen los mismos organizadores de esa marcha
8802431 ya se logr con este mpetu que tenemos para la marcha iluminemos m xico que se reuniera el consejo en pleno y los funcionarios ya firmaron una acuerdo con puntos t rminos y fechas
8802432 creo que de cuatro a os para ac no se hab a reunido en pleno todo el consejo de seguridad incluyendo gobernadores secretarios de estado encargados de seguridad p blica federales lo que ya es positivo
8802433 obama has put a serious dent in mccains ability to continue campaigning with dumb soundbites and too cute by half innuendo this isnt a teenagers campaign for junior high student council he was saying its a campaign for president of the united states and youre old enough to know that you should damn well treat it that way
8802434 i also think he made the right decision to directly and in the case of the celeb meme explicitly confront the smears particularly the attacks on obamas americanness and patriotism the tone didnt strike me as defensive or outraged which is a different side of defensiveness but more one of what i might call assertive contempt
8802435 the most impressive campaign speech from an american presidential candidate i can recall in my lifetime
8802436 it was a liberal speech more unabashedly unashamedly liberal than any democratic acceptance speech since the great era of american liberalism but it made the case for that liberalism in the context of the decline of the american dream and the rise of cynicism and the collapse of cultural unity his ability to portray that liberalism as a patriotic unifying ennobling tradition makes him the most lethal and remarkable democratic figure since john f kennedy
8802437 only a moral cretin could fail to be inspired when the speech rolled around in its closing moments to martin luther king jr but that inspirational moment was just a moment and i think that the pundits and advisers who urged barack obama to temper his soaring rhetoric and produce a more workmanlike down to earth speech did him a disservice the speech had good lines and good sections but for the most part it felt surprisingly banal and jury rigged and it suffered throughout from a failure to cohere around any single theme or rhetorical style
8802438 a s a piece of writing with a logical structure gores speech is better than most ive seen this week including ones that were more effective it plants down its premises and builds on them it makes an argument it demands a bit of attention its a nice change of pace from say bill richardson p s he does not associate the peace and prosperity of 2000 with clinton doesnt mention his name interesting
8802439 wonder whether its losing a presidential election that unleashes the inner demosthenes in a man or merely being rid of the bob shrums of the world
8802440 wonder whether it s losing a presidential election that unleashes the inner demosthenes in a man
8802441 cant you buy shoes that would allow for the same kind of sensation
8802442 yeah but they dont look as cool and besides i skated for almost three hours without falling once
8802443 how many times have i told you not to talk on the cell phone when youre using the chain saw
8802444 i love you and theres nothing you can do about it
8802445 it looks like they regret opening the voting to the public and letting wrko buy and promote howie carrs election
8802446 i dont view these statistics as a problem but a chance for gods name to be great among a generation that is spiritual but not religious
8802447 what we found is that young adults desire to do life together
8802448 they desire relational equity and community that goes beyond casual hellos they want to pour their lives into each other
8802449 it will be a failure if we raise a generation who are just friends growing in the likeness of christ is essential
8802450 what we found in our research is that young adults who are churched are saying if we are going to stand for truth in a world that is not standing for truth we want to be equipped
8802451 the unchurched are saying we are not going to make a decision at face value
8802452 our god is a never changing god yet he is constantly relevant
8802453 teach the whole bible foster discussion and answer the difficult questions of faith
8802454 offer quality exegetical bible teaching and sing theologically sound music that accurately depicts the word of god
8802455 for both church and unchurched young adults we have found that both recognize that their choices make a difference and they want to improve the world around them
8802456 as a result of this heightened sense of responsibility we can help create a door for service and evangelism
8802457 as we continue to understand younger adults and what theyre looking for we must recognize the heavy value they place on connecting with people who have more life experience than they do
8802458 some would call this mentoring or cross generational ministry the bottom line is that they want to learn from someone elses experiences theyre looking for a connection with the church and a connection with people who are willing to walk alongside them and give a little advice here and there
8802459 if an absence exists between what you say and what you do young adults will become quickly disinterested
8802460 if you desire for your church to be a healthy body that raises the banner of intergenerational ministry you need to personally invest in this generation as well
8802461 we have kids who may not believe in god but they are willing to come to social events or service events we want to keep a relationship with them anyway we can so they continue to hear the word of god
8802462 the responsibility aspect of young adult ministry does make sense
8802463 young adult ministry is not about wowing this generation with the latest shows but about allowing them to impact their world those who come to our church are extremely interested in supporting events that make the world a better place in providing opportunities to serve we ultimately hope nonbelievers will make decisions for christ
8802464 this conference really opened my eyes to the main characteristics of the postmodern culture and how young adults view the world around them
8802465 as a result of this conference i will be a better listener to the young adults i serve
8802466 i will make your battlements of rubies your gates of sparkling jewels and all your walls of precious stones all your sons will be taught by the lord and great will be your childrens peace
8802467 i withheld judgment on any of these issues and i am still doing so until i have the chance to study the technical work that is being done
8802468 but before that technical work is done and discussed properly and discussed thoroughly and consulted on a national jurisdiction i think it would be premature to speak in any definitive term about participation in any political union
8802469 congratulations and welcome back to nevis i am sure you have done nevis proud our first female olympian going that far i want to congratulate you for reaching this far deputy premier and minister of sports on nevis henslay daniel welcomes olympian ms meritza williams at the charlestown
8802470 as you continue your athletic journey you are likely to go much further all the best and i join with all of nevis in saying congratulations and wish you all the best for the future
8802471 welcome back to nevis and congrats you have the olympic experience now so it only gets better so congratulations you did well i hope the experience serves you good in the future
8802472 i have always been a fan of athletics when i was 13 i had the school record for 440 yards so i always credit myself and my family as athletes and so i am always interested in athletics wherever
8802473 i thought to be specific small island fantastic talent on the island of nevis but we have so many elquimedo derrick parry stuart williams and its just for us to remind people that we can do it
8802474 in track and field you have a lot of opportunities
8802475 i learnt that track can take you very far in life most of all when you go out on the track you just have to have faith and god will help you through it
8802476 right now i am on off season so im just here for vacation and i plan to be with my family
8802477 it felt good to see her take part in the olympics because the night before that i saw her on espn running at the poland games so watching her two night straight it felt good i had already shed some tears when she came from poland for everything that we went through before and to see that she made it to the olympics so i was trying to be joyful at that moment
8802478 we need to stop being flatulent spewing rhetoric about ethnic diversity and set up a press
8802479 prior to just sitting down and watching the games for these last couple of weeks there has been several things that had happened in the last two years that kind of signal to me that things were changing and moving in a different direction
8802480 first the separation from my coach who has been very instrumental in my career moving to a different state with my husband dennis as he begins his coaching career and with my pregnancy earlier in the year those were the kind of things that had my career slow down right before the olympics
8802481 honestly to tell you the truth ive watched the games for the last two weeks and ive been the biggest bahamian supporter
8802482 ive enjoyed watching everything and even though there is that excitement as an athlete watching my friend and fellow bahamians run i never had that itch to be back out there again
8802483 i think anytime someone with my caliber in the sport can sit down and watch it and not want to be out there i think that it kind of signals that i am comfortable and i have accomplished all that i can accomplish in the sport and i am content with that
8802484 there is always that small possibility and you never know what the future holds but right now i have sight set on other stuff i have been running for like 16 years now from a carifta athlete so there are so many aspects of my life that i havent been able to explore
8802485 the newest computer can merely compound at speed the oldest problem in the relations between human beings and in the end the communicator will be confronted with the old problem of what to say and how to say it
8802486 our commitment is to quick response a systematic approach and a high degree of professionalism when a crime has been committed effective crime detection is a priority
8802487 heightened proficiency in evidence collection heightened proficiency in the preparation of case files heightened professionalism and capacity building these are all priorities
8802488 in a matter of months the rcmp will be here in the federation implementing this programme that we have developed and they will be funding
8802489 was vital as crime is global in its causes and its manifestations as the fight against crime must similarly extend beyond our borders as well
8802490 it is our hope that montserrat gains recognition as a destination for competitive sport fishing
8802491 anglers will find montserrats annual tournament to be a challenging yet thrilling and rewarding experience
8802492 our history has shown us that every time there is direct inappropriate political interference in the general operations of the force there is always serious negative consequences and repercussions
8802493 i think that usains dominance in the 100 meters brings a lot of jealousy because normally you have one country that usually dominates this event
8802494 i have been to eight olympics and i have seen celebration of all kinds i was in seoul and flo jo was running the last 20 meters with her hand waving in front of the other competitors nobody said anything
8802495 i think the comments are unfair and that there was a certain amount of targeting
8802496 but if they are trying to get in his mind they are wasting their time
8802497 no one who saw the nbc broadcasts i have done on bolt could possibly ever say i have begrudged the man his wins or his success or even his exuberance
8802498 guess what my teacher doesnt even have a behavior chart
8802499 this isnt working in the system can you fix it because im in an appointment and need it to work
8802500 detroit listeners out there you better be sure to stop by the galaxy club where theres a freestyle superfly fresh contest going on tonight if you got the skills you better get your hiphop ass on down here cause we got dj clueless on the wheels of steel
8802501 kill the dj f k what he play mayday mayday
8802502 elections 2008 making it easy to find images and videos for things you are interested
8802503 you never dreamed that a black man could get this far
8802504 listening to him obama talk it kind of reminded me of my husband where they had that same type of passion when they talk
8802505 to see barack sen obama get this far hed feel the same way that i do
8802506 i would like to say that everybody is going to be 110 percent for him but its not going to be the truth
8802507 a lot of people are not going to be because they cant look beyond his color of his skin and thats sad
8802508 i think just as far as like some people not voting for him i dont think people will vote for him just because hes black i think they would vote for him more on his issues what he believes in
8802509 to me hes just only a human being just like the next person and he has knowledge too
8802510 he would just be overwhelmed by whats going on tonight
8802511 it would be a historic moment and he would have loved it would have loved it and my regret is that hes not here to witness that
8802512 between lake delton the wisconsin river mirror lake and devils lake state park were so fortunate to have so many fantastic bodies of water that have great fishing
8802513 theres been a lot of suffering in wisconsin this year
8802514 this was certainly not in the state budget not in the lake delton village budget when this disaster occurred
8802515 restoring the fishery will help rebuild the multi faceted recreational opportunities here in lake delton and in the wisconsin dells area
8802516 any donation of any amount will help restore the fishery and fish habitat
8802517 for 15 you can adopt a fingerling or for a larger donation you can have naming rights to a fishing reef
8802518 the dnr is not able to transfer fish like we were a few years ago due to the vhs disease and large mouth bass virus
8802519 most of these fish will have to be purchased from hatcheries with disease free certified fish
8802520 we need to chemically treat the creek and pond in front of the dam
8802521 we need to do that when the dam is closed in december
8802522 there are treatments that have to be done because there are rough fish in the lake
8802523 what an opportunity to install a fish habitat when you can actually see where its going
8802524 my guess is that the fishing will be slow to start because it costs a lot of money to put a lot of fish in the lake
8802525 over the course of the next few years youll see the fishing improve steadily and within four to five years it will be better than it ever was
8802526 im going to do my best during that and thats it
8802527 i think hillman doesnt like me sometimes i dont know theres no way when im in there i do my job i try to do my best every time i go over there to the coaches i say something but i think nobody listens to me thats what i think
8802528 but i know im a good player everybody knows i can play anywhere
8802529 we cant add a 10th slot to the lineup we do every day with the lineup what we think is best for the battery and overall team nobodys said anything to me or approached me with anything i havent heard whether its me or any other coach if he feels like were not listening hed be mistaken
8802530 hes one of the best 30 catchers in baseball but thats because theres not a lot of other good ones
8802531 mccain said he will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8802532 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8802533 theyve lost contact with columbia and youre on the air in five four three
8802534 there are many online tools customers can download and use to measure their consumption
8802535 i think there is a 90 probability the great crisis will be upon us within ten years
8802536 so the question is how much of our taxpayer money and inflationary fiat money will be used to bail them out
8802537 they are made in the us out of brazilian cherry wood laminated with the handle cast out of bronze its very very tough yet also a piece of artwork in california where it is so often difficult or impossible to carry something to defend yourself with it also has a dual function of being used as a baton or long hammer since they are classed as ambulatory aids tsa wont be able to stop you from bringing your cane onboard an aircraft i can see how someone might want to take this cane on vacation where you cannot legally or conveniently carry another self defense device
8802538 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8802539 but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8802540 my father john gage was very committed to helping the victims of the flood of 2008 unfortunately he died in a car accident just a week before finishing this documentary
8802541 he was up in jefferson and he said he saw an awful lot of people concerned about this but then he ran into some people who were actually being hurt by what was going on
8802542 the end result will be that a lot of people will get help by it all the money raise is going right back into flood relief theres no production cost on our part
8802543 its very important to the citizens of our county to have this kind of documentary so for us it was just a natural fund to develop
8802544 its not the gun whatever it may be hes looking for fresh human odor
8802545 the start up costs for one dog is anywhere between 50 to 65 000 theres the price of the car equipment radio along with the dog and training with dog
8802546 he can point out danger situations before we get to them
8802547 looking back at that occurrence for the first and last time it was a missed call
8802548 and it was not because doug eddings an umpire with 10 years experience and 10 before that in the minor leagues didnt know the application of the rule but just that in the moment in applying the rule he saw something he thought was more than it turned out to be
8802549 recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that a single genetic event in the map kinase signaling pathway may be sufficient for thyroid cell transformation and tumor development
8802550 thyroid cancer is associated with exposure to external or internal ionizing radiation elucidation of mechanisms of radiation induced cancer in humans especially early steps and pathways has potential implications for epidemiological risk analyses early clinical diagnosis and chemopreventive interventions
8802551 that means that a younger person living close to the bombing site would be more likely to have adult onset thyroid cancer having ret ptc rearrangements
8802552 approximately 12 million people a year in the u s seek medical care for impacted or excessive cerumen
8802553 this leads to nearly 8 million cerumen removal procedures by health care professionals developing practical clinical guidelines for physicians to understand the harm vs benefit profile of the intervention was essential
8802554 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove cerumen from the ears
8802555 this can result in further impaction and other complications to the ear canal
8802556 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and ongoing including infections and hearing loss
8802557 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes
8802558 when it starts to affect your sleeping and your lifestyle then its time to get it done
8802559 all the things i liked to do bike walk garden it became a chore
8802560 i think the company wanted to show that this technology was applicable in a community setting like ours
8802561 to determine alignment we would normally be putting a large drill hole at the end of the thigh bone and sliding these big rods up and down inside the bone to create the alignment measurements that is entirely eliminated with this system
8802562 so i regained my range of motion faster my physical therapy was faster i didnt have as much swelling as much pain up here and down my leg
8802563 if its aligned properly and this is a system to measure the entire hip leg knee and ankle well be able to create a perfect or nearly perfect alignment
8802564 to be able to do those things it feels awesome and im so glad they have something that you can get back to that point
8802565 this is a potentially revolutionary advance in the field of forensics said the papers senior author dr
8802566 by employing the powers of genomic technology it is now possible to know with near certainty that a particular individual was at a particular location even with only trace amounts of dna and even if dozens or even hundreds of others were there too
8802567 as technology advances we need to be prepared to keep evidence that down the road could prove again to be useful said vermeer who heads a bureau of nearly 130 analysts and crime scene investigators
8802568 often stymied because they now search for fewer than 20 dna markers the tgen researchers looked at hundreds of thousands of markers to make their identifications he said
8802569 it opens up a whole new can of worms of whats possible to do forensically said nelson professor of human genetics and psychiatry at uclas david geffen school of medicine nelson contributed to the tgen paper
8802570 an intellectual curiosity by craig while investigating diseases nils homer a former tgen intern who now is working on his doctorate degree in computer science at ucla brought nelson and craig together homer is the papers first author
8802571 hmm i guess here is where i now refine the setup of my 5 1 surround sound the calibration mic must have only got me started
8802572 due to internal myspace difficulties tonights rgz live with melissa walker will be rescheduled watch the forum for the new date so you dont miss this awesome chat with melissa
8802573 we expect to see that kind of thing in myanmar not on the streets of denver
8802574 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl
8802575 any references to saudis and terrorist s in the book
8802576 could potentially create libel lawsuits as it could offend saudis living in england and this has happened with many other u s publications and we do not want to be jeopardized in selling this book
8802577 we could set the goal very very high and not achieve that and then if we established we were going to give out more money than we have then that would not be appropriate
8802578 so we set the goal at what we think is an attainable amount this year
8802579 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8802580 we are facing a planetary emergency which is not like anything we have experienced in the history of humankind
8802581 the solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon based fossil fuels
8802582 we need to invest in innovation i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out to tackle that
8802583 promises to appoint more antonin scalias and clarence thomases and end a womans right to choose
8802584 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8802585 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheny white house and promising to actually continue them
8802586 i get by with a little help actually a lot of help from my friends
8802587 you walk up to kids today and you ask them about global warming and issues like that and half of them look at you and think whats that
8802588 you know they dont know whats going on and whats going to happen if we dont start working on this issue now
8802589 my father just literally died in my arms i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral
8802590 this will show her true colors thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick
8802591 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8802592 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8802593 theyd love katy to lock lips with a woman specifically lindsay and theyre actually going to ask
8802594 we smell like vanilla we smell like watermelon we smell like strawberries
8802595 we have loved hosting the jonas brothers on their personal vacations to atlantis and are thrilled to finally have them perform for our guests
8802596 atlantis has a long history of hosting the hottest bands for guest performances and the jonas brothers are an unbelievable finale to this years atlantis live concert series
8802597 im not so sure youd want to see me eat it might not make a great first impression
8802598 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment
8802599 i got a lot of canned items and goods that i keep at home all the time now
8802600 we always recommend you have the three day emergency kit your canned goods water flashlights batteries if you have a generator now is the time to crank it because most peoples generators havent been used in three years

8802663 the australian drought of the early twenty first century threw long standing chasms between use and realities of water supply into relief the issue of water scarcity in australia has always existed but as a nation we have always managed to ignore it however these present conditions have created increasing pressure for water users and managers to ensure adequate supplies for consumption

8802676 every single person counts and we need every person ive got leukemia i had a stroke several years ago but im out there every weekend barack needs the support so he can make the changes that we need
8802677 im thinking of running for local office now that ive gained all this expertise
8802678 this was the first campaign i felt i needed to support i dont have a lot of money but i donate what i can because i believe in barack

8802704 people there live in town houses or terrace houses the houses are never one storey and you have got the population that lives closer to the city
8802705 we have to curtail land subdivisions at the extremities of the city the other option is to put in some very fast trains to regional centres somewhere like geelong could be an attractive destination for working and living

8802732 timmy is very humble he doesnt think hes gods gift to baseball hes friendly to everybody he never rejects an autograph hes as down to earth as you can get
8802733 but hes just starting to understand how truly good his stuff is in the past ive heard comments like im not going to get away with that pitch now hes realizing i can get away with that and more
8802734 he can throw pitches down the middle that the rest of us cant
8802735 this is a very hard decision for me to make as i feel that i could possibly play one more year but out of respect i would only do that if i felt 100 percent

8802762 the information gathered from the internal audit conducted by b amp e officials will be turned over to the american association of collegiate registrars and admissions officers the consulting group already secured to review university wide academic record policies and procedures for further review
8802763 this extra outside examination will be conducted during two and three day site visits from september through november and is intended as an intensive review of academic records and degree granting practices at the college as well as university wide in order to make appropriate recommendations for the future
8802764 and while we understand there are discrepancies in some of the records related to those approximately 780 students in those cohorts over that 10 year span it would be inappropriate to discuss it further pending this external review a final report with recommendations for responsive actions will likely be generated by academic affairs once aacrao offers their input

8802810 consider also that the other members of the so called bric nations have rapidly growing middle classes as well between now and 2025 for example indias middle class will grow tenfold
8802811 given that there is a cultural affinity toward gold ownership in china and india in particular i think its safe to assume that with more wealth will come more demand for the yellow metal from these countries factor in the price risks associated with a middle class that will comprise more than 50 percent of the global population in less than 20 years and gold just over 800 an ounce is a real bargain check that gold is a steal at these levels

8802840 i am the good shepherd the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep but he who is an hireling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees and the wolf catches them and scatters the sheep the hireling flees because he is a hireling and cares not for the sheep
8802841 son of man i have made you a watchman unto the house of israel therefore hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me
8802842 now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them
8802843 study to show yourself approved unto god a workman who needs not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth
8802844 or how will you say to your brother let me pull out the mote out of your eye and behold a beam is in your own eye you hypocrite first cast out the beam out of your own eye and then you shall see clearly to cast out the mote out of your brothers eye
8802845 you shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree brings forth good fruit but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit
8802846 for i verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though i were present concerning him who has so done this deed for what have i to do to judge them also who are without do not you judge them who are within but them who are without god judges therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person

8802854 beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing
8802855 beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy
8802856 o generation of vipers how can you being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
8802857 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world
8802858 tried them which say they are apostles and are not and have found them liars
8802859 to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them
8802860 now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his

8802866 john mccain ha votado con george bush el 90 por ciento de las veces al senador mccain le gusta hablar de tener criterio pero realmente qu criterio tienes si piensas que george bush ha estado en lo cierto en el 90 por ciento de las veces
8802867 no s ustedes pero yo no estoy dispuesto a apostar que la posibilidad de cambio sea del 10 por ciento
8802868 no creo que al senador mccain no le importe la vida de los estadounidenses realmente lo que creo es que no sabe lo que les pasa c mo se puede explicar que defina la clase media como la familia que ingresa m s de cinco millones de d lares al a o

8802872 sort of the origin tale that mixes the historical prince vlad of transylvania with sort of fictionalized bram stoker take
8802873 we had to stay extremely basic when we went to the 4 3 last year
8802874 you couldnt teach an entire defense in four days we didnt think we got enough pressure on the quarterback so weve added a lot to this defense in the off season and the kids are doing a good job i think the biggest thing is the kids just need to start playing the kids get tired of hitting each other i think once we get on the field and then start looking at film and how they perform in games i think their intensity level will pick up
8802875 but for whatever reason the 3 5 didnt work last year whether it was chemistry coaching or whatever the case may be so we switched we contemplated going back to the 4 4 but we determined the 4 3 would be easier to teach in the middle of the season
8802876 you cant compare last years profit with this years financial result
8802877 while there was a loss this year cellnet has wiped its debts and is back on its feet with a good balance sheet
8802878 while the current years results are clearly unsatisfactory cellnets healthy and strong balance sheet means 2009 will be about building on that strength
8802879 cellnet is a strong and debt free company and there have been all sorts of inquires made about cellnet its because cellnet is healthy that these companies are making inquiries
8802880 i guess people can speculate to their hearts content about the direction of cellnet after all its an industry riddled with all sorts of rumours
8802881 overall i think we can pick up the pace a little on offense
8802882 at one point we had run 33 plays with 10 minutes left in the second quarter i think we ended up with 42 in a half if we can average 70 plays in a game were going to have a very good year and a lot of offensive stats hopefully that will lead to a lot of wins

8802889 my grandmother has more internet savvy than i do and shes been dead for 33 years
8802890 overall unpatched systems and lack of user awareness coupled with the number of people freely roaming the internet makes these rce vulnerabilities more profitable and more easily exploitable than the remote attacks from days gone by

8802895 i am not willing to take a 10 chance on change
8802896 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for president of the united states
8802897 yeah ive felt that way from time to time myself
8802898 i mean im ready really i am it just seems weird its so final you know
8802899 i had it done three years ago and im sure i was as nervous as you are now but its so easy you dont feel a thing all this machinery it all looks intimidating but you just sit here the doctor does his job and snip youre done
8802900 thats just so you dont get surprised or jump or anything during the procedure there could be complications
8802901 okay youre all ready doctor bell will be with you in a moment
8802902 oh theres no cause for that you wont feel a thing ive performed this procedure close to three thousand times
8802903 no no fatalities of course not no complications at all
8802904 im going to give you some post surgical care instructions there shouldnt be any problems but we want you to stay fit and healthy of course here
8802905 oh my god roger its theresa youve had the snip i can tell havent you
8802906 i dont know what i was so worried about there really wasnt anything to it at all
8802907 everyone knows that roger youre so funny hey you want to get together go on a date tonight i mean i know youve been attracted to me for a long time but well you know
8802908 of course i would theresa nothing would make me happier
8802909 great ill pick you up at your apartment in half an hour okay i know youre probably still getting used to things
8802910 sometimes after the snip theres some well some slipping its nothing to worry about come on lets go
8802911 he can fix you again come and make love to me again
8802912 the snip didnt take i want to schedule another one
8802913 spontaneous reversal of the snip isnt unknown were still not sure how it happens an ontological mutation to the essential phenomenological construct we think which causes a spontaneous reintegration of the internal experience of self some sort of cartesian impairment perhaps
8802914 im afraid its not phenomenological deconstructs hindered by ontological deformations are notoriously difficult to treat the best experimental philosophers have struggled with the problem but all attempts to establish a full physiological denial of the self experience have failed
8802915 im not interested if i cant have the real thing i dont want it at all
8802916 then is there anything else i can do for you
8802917 i saw you at doctor bells office the snip didnt take for you did it
8802918 i just wanted to be like everyone else i wanted to be able to not care to just ignore everything and not worry about anything
8802919 yeah so ive had the taste of emptiness of the state of nonbeing while still being here i cant take this constant awareness of myself especially knowing that everyone else around me is unburdened with it
8802920 oh nothing i mean ive heard some real lame excuses to commit suicide before but that one was one of the worst you should have thrown in an unrequited love a crushing debt or at least a dead puppy agony of being
8802921 im just here to catch a snack i was hoping to catch you at doctor bells office of course but that didnt work out
8802922 theres no need to worry yourself about it just go about your business all right pretend like im not here
8802923 heehee i seem to have evicted jerry already i have to mute the feeds when he gets on his 75yr old high horse
8802924 duh no hes dumb and will be following me here shortly
8802925 we did a good job this year of understanding what we wanted to get out of it and what we wanted to accomplish we had a couple injuries that you would like to get through without but as a whole were better as a team from when we went to camp
8802926 clearly when the regular season starts it goes to another level
8802927 and as defending champs its a new challenge and were looking forward to it
8802928 we have a lot of tough decisions ahead of us with the back end of the roster so i wanted to give those guys an opportunity and you cant do that without giving them reps
8802929 i think they drafted me for a reason ill go watch film and wait
8802930 now well go back evaluate the film and make cuts but there are some guys here that really showed well for themselves and guys that didnt
8802931 i think i have progressed every game throughout the preseason that was my goal if i can continue to do that then hopefully ill have a great career here
8802932 you know every night we send a pretty good pitcher to the mound a lot of times those games are going to flow your way
8802933 you look at it and kind of wonder how close the refs were to blowing the whistle and stopping the play
8802934 its a slow process moving to a new position youre going to hit a few bumps but im getting better
8802935 after the first quarter i had to tell myself to settle down
8802936 everything is absolutely on track i can look you in the eyes and tell you its on track
8802937 sony basically has pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3 because its lost more money than they made during the entire peak of the playstation 2
8802938 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer
8802939 half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats and in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware
8802940 we had all worked together at various times within the department and even after we went our separate ways and worked on our own projects the members of the collective kept in touch despite our successes with various films we continued to lament our humourless representations on the small screen we wanted to change that
8802941 once again the strength of our department is on display as the first pan asian comedy show to air in this country a thousand apologies represents a new chapter in television history
8802942 analis first amendment is a delectable blend of current events and the most delicious looking homemade treats
8802943 we commend the u s department of justice the u s attorneys offices for the western district of north carolina and the eastern district of virginia and the federal bureau of investigation for their work in bringing these criminals to justice the esa and its members will continue to support law enforcements efforts to protect the intellectual property of our industry
8802944 it is requested that members do not partake of any refreshments until after the iftar refreshments are served
8802945 i have way more respect for the safeties than i did before
8802946 they have a lot on their heads a lot they have to get out they have to talk to the linebackers and get everybody lined up
8802947 when margini told me he was moving me to safety i was kind of shocked
8802948 but it is what it is its just a matter of going out there and seeing it and knowing what to do
8802949 i take it being switched like this they the jets want to look at guys they want to see what guys can do out there if they can do better than what i can do out there so be it
8802950 its a little different from being out there on the corner on an island the whole time you have to get used to that
8802951 dwight has worked with the first team david barrett has worked with the first team hank poteat has worked with the first team
8802952 thats part of the thought process to have multiple guys that can fill in you saw last week against the giants we worked a lot of guys in a lot of different spots in the secondary to build that flexibility
8802953 you learn to be patient this game is a marathon not a sprint
8802954 hes moved fairly quickly through our system and people have been real high on him
8802955 we have a lot of tough decisions ahead of us with the back end of the roster so i wanted to give those guys an opportunity and you cant do that without giving them reps
8802956 i think they drafted me for a reason ill go watch film and wait
8802957 now well go back evaluate the film and make cuts but there are some guys here that really showed well for themselves and guys that didnt
8802958 i think i have progressed every game throughout the pre season that was my goal if i can continue to do that then hopefully ill have a great career here

8802961 my girlfriend is nigerian kind of and when we go through the shops were followed all the way we stop the security guards stop we go up the escalator theyre three steps behind us and theres another one waiting at the top we look at something say a shoe and they all look at us looking at the shoe
8802962 youre never lonely in dublin if youre with a black girl
8802963 how good was this rushed launch title barely utilizing the ps3s abilities that i am having this much fun at it
8802964 i dont know how far ahead they planned that we obviously revealed our drum kit much earlier than they did
8802965 ive a feeling there was a oh s theres cymbals how can we put cymbals on our kit that would be the easiest way without having to rewire everything and re engineer the entire circuit board
8802966 my understanding on that drum kit is the cymbals are dual mapped so its just another way to trigger the exact same thing you can trigger on the kit
8802967 we have a lot of expandability you can plug in any drum kit and play it if you want to use a keyboard and play the right notes for drums you can do that you can use one of those hand sonic drums you can use any input device that transmits on midi channel 10 in our game to trigger the drums it could be a power glove
8802968 you can easily run a double bass pedal on our game
8802969 we have future expandability for high hat control pedals it would also be very easy for us to add other cymbals via the midi interface with the midi jack we can expand it to as many drums and cymbals as humanly possible theres just only so many that the casual consumer can take
8802970 our high hat control would not just be another way to trigger the high hat it would be a completely separate interface thats mapped differently and that correlates differently in game
8802971 it might just look like more songs but really the technology that were pushing forward and some of the features weve added its not just a title update it really is a new game with a lot of really great stuff
8802972 we actually have expansion ports on the back of our drum kits that let you attach three cymbals to your drum set
8802973 at harmonix we really are musicians first and game people second my drum set has three cymbals on it i dont know how many drum sets youve seen with two cymbals on them i guess thats a question for other people
8802974 just order them all to commit seppuku and lets be done with it
8802975 he had also had the same ringing in his ears
8802976 when the storms the worst and the sea the most dreadful thats when you need your special wits
8802977 i dont have to say nothing yall do a good job with that yall do my job well i dont worry about that
8802978 no matter how we lose no matter how tough that loss is we find a way to bounce back we dont allow things to get out of control for an extended period of time
8802979 last year when things went wrong we didnt have the experience or confidence to look at it and say ok we can cut this out right now we allowed things to snowball we kept looking in the rearview mirror instead of looking ahead at what we needed to accomplish
8802980 its going to be in the back of your mind whether you like it or not
8802981 with boston every time we lost we took it to heart we did not want to look like the year before and i dont think we ever did once we had the chance to make a statement we made it in a big way i think thats what we need to do
8802982 i think we have to make that same kind of statement theres a lot of proud guys here and a lot of professionals that know and understand we can never look like that again if we lose it we lose it but not in the same way
8802983 now well go back and evaluate the film and make the cuts
8802984 it was my first start although its just the preseason and the starters werent out there with me its still big for me it breaks me in slowly to hopefully what i am going to be one day
8802985 mcdougle has done a heck of a job hes played good football
8802986 every chance you get you have to take advantage of it i had 36 35 chances combined rushes and receptions and i tried my best to take advantage every time i touched it
8802987 he had worked some there in camp but he really hadnt gotten very many reps inside there
8802988 i understand why he didnt want to play the starters
8802989 i wanted to play but its not a big deal i never really brought it up
8802990 after this convention ends and the lights of this great stadium go dark will come the morning light and the dawning of a new day
8802991 over the past 31 years there have been so many people who have been involved with this dream that it would be impossible to thank them all but it is a dream that has been realised because of them
8802992 i can only imagine how amazing it is going to be for golfers and visitors to singleton
8802993 at last we can officially say that nothing can stop this from going ahead
8802994 singleton and visiting golfers will have the championship golf course that they deserve and can be proud of
8802995 the entire estate will be identified as a smart technology residential golf community
8802996 fibre optics is the super highway for technology and applications for it are endless
8802997 among many other advantages fibre to the home ftth will deliver the high speed broadband to a residential estate like the town has been aching for
8802998 while i dont see a lancasters type showroom there it might be suitable for caravans or boats or something that takes up a lot of room may be possible
8802999 rather than prohibit everything it will mean assessing what is appropriate
8803000 discussing what each others focuses for their time as miss showgirl would be was very interesting
8803001 other regions are really building the profile of the miss showgirl competition by getting them involved in charity work and it seemed to be generating a lot of interest
8803002 the beauty of it too is that the competition is open to so many different personalities and is not excluded to just someone with a strong farming background
8803003 one of the great things about it is that each miss showgirl learns things along the way about how the competition can support the community and then is able to convey any ideas onto the next winner
8803004 the winner first and second runners up have many opportunities open up to them in both job offers and career prospects
8803005 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8803006 this is the finest convention speech ive ever heard it wasnt a liberal speech it wasnt a conservative speech it was a unifying speech

8803012 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and nbled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8803013 they have not served a red america or a blue america
8803014 they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8803015 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8803016 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8803017 barack obamas speech tonight laid out his specific bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future his speech crystallized the clear choice between he and senator mccain four more years of the same failed policies or a leader who can tackle the great challenges we face revitalizing our economy and restoring our standing in the world i am proud to support senator obama our next president of the united states and joe biden our next vice president of the united states
8803018 were just floored there was never a time never a moment that felt so important and made us want to give a little more go a little further
8803019 he gave us the confidence to do that im proud to be a democrat and im proud to be an american
8803020 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on

8803070 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8803071 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8803072 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8803073 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8803074 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8803075 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8803076 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8803077 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8803078 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8803079 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8803080 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8803081 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8803082 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8803083 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8803084 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8803085 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d
8803086 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8803087 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8803088 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8803089 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8803090 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8803091 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8803092 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8803093 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8803094 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8803095 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8803096 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8803097 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8803098 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8803099 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8803100 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8803101 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8803102 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8803103 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8803104 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8803105 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8803106 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8803107 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8803108 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8803109 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8803110 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8803111 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8803112 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8803113 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8803114 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8803115 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8803116 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8803117 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8803118 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8803119 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8803120 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had
8803121 if they have no record to run on they get the voters to run from their opponent

8803165 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8803166 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8803167 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8803168 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8803169 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8803170 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example
8803171 a third of all cases of cerebral palsy are associated with preterm birth
8803172 this study shows a significant reduction in cerebral palsy among preterm infants whose mothers were given magnesium sulfate
8803173 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to date that looked at using this inexpensive and commonly used treatment to reduce the occurrence of cerebral palsy after preterm birth
8803174 cerebral palsy cant always be prevented but the data from our study and its predecessors will help obstetricians make informed treatment decisions for the women under their care
8803175 our results show that obstetricians can use magnesium sulfate which they have experience prescribing to reduce the risk of a devastating condition cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8803176 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market

8803207 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8803208 health inequity really is a matter of life and death
8803209 but health systems will not naturally gravitate towards equity unprecedented leadership is needed that compels all actors including those beyond the health sector to examine their impact on health primary health care which integrates health in all of governments policies is the best framework for doing so
8803210 central to the commissions recommendations is creating the conditions for people to be empowered to have freedom to lead flourishing lives nowhere is lack of empowerment more obvious than in the plight of women in many parts of the world health suffers as a result following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people
8803211 water borne diseases are not caused by a lack of antibiotics but by dirty water and by the political social and economic forces that fail to make clean water available to all heart disease is caused not by a lack of coronary care units but by lives people lead which are shaped by the environments in which they live obesity is not caused by moral failure on the part of individuals but by the excess availability of high fat and high sugar foods
8803212 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8803213 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8803214 it is wonderful to have global endorsement of the australian closing the gap campaign from the csdh established by the who the csdh sets closing the gap as a goal for the whole world and produces the evidence on how health inequities are a reflection of the way we organize society and distribute power and resources the good news from the csdh for australia is that it provides plenty of ideas on how to set an agenda that will tackle the underlying determinants of health and create a healthier australia for all of us
8803215 canada likes to brag that for seven years in a row the united nations voted us
8803216 a fairer world will be a healthier world a health service and medical interventions are just one of the factors that influence population health the growth of inequalities and the phenomena of increased injustice in health is present in low and middle income countries as well as across europe it would be a crime not to take every action possible to reduce them
8803217 the report suggests avenues for action from the local to national and global levels it has been eagerly awaited by policy makers health officials grassroot activists and their community based organizations much of the research and evidence is of particular relevance to the south east asian region where too many people struggle daily for justice and equity in health the report will inspire the region to act and develop new policies and programmes
8803218 a man should not be concerned with whether he has enough possessions but whether possessions have been equally distributed
8803219 the who commission addresses one of the major issues of our global world health inequity the reports recommendations will be perceived utilized and implemented as a major policy agenda at national and global levels the issue will increase in importance as the general public become more engaged via civil society movements and multi stakeholder involvement
8803220 according to the islamic ideology social justice became a priority when the islamic revolution materialized in iran establishing a solid primary health care network in our country not only improved our health statistics but it was an excellent vehicle to move towards health equity now through the final report of the csdh and implementing its recommendations we need to move much faster in our own country toward health equity
8803221 the commission on social determinants of health report will help african leaders adapt their national development strategies to address the challenges to health these are derived from the current systemic changes taking place in the global economy that affects heavily on the poorest segments of africas population
8803222 the primary object of development for any country and for the world as a whole is the elimination of unfreedoms that reduce and impoverish the lives of people central to human deprivation is the failure of the capability to live long and healthy lives this is much more than a medical problem it relates to handicaps that have deep social roots under michael marmots leadership this who commission has concentrated on the badly neglected causal linkages that have to be adequately understood and remedied a fuller understanding is also a call for action
8803223 the united states of america spends more on health care than any other country in the world yet it ranks 41st in terms of life expectancy new orleans and its experience with hurricane katrina illustrate why we need to target social determinants of health sdh including housing education working and learning conditions and whether people are exposed to toxins better than any place i can think of right now by targeting the sdh we can rapidly move towards closing the gap that unfairly and avoidably separates the health status of groups of different socio economic status social exclusion experience and educational background
8803224 health delivery is not possible for people living in squalor in dehumanizing pathetic conditions prevailing in the ever growing slum settlements of cities and towns in developing countries investment in basic services such as water and education will always remain constrained if not wasted unless accompanied by requisite investment in decent housing with basic sanitation
8803225 countries of the world are presently growing apart in health terms this is very worrying in many countries in the world social differences in health are also growing and this is true in europe we have been one sidedly focused on economic growth disregarding negative consequences for health and climate we need to think differently about development
8803226 what this report makes clear is that improving health and health outcomes and reducing avoidable health differences goals of all countries involves far more than just improving the health care system basic living conditions employment early childhood education treatment of women and poverty all impact on health outcomes and incorporating their effects on health outcomes needs to become an important part of public policymaking this is as true for wealthy countries like the united states as it is for many of the emerging countries of the world where large numbers of people live on less than 2 per day
8803227 the fast turnaround and extra attention they paid to my submissions was well worth the money
8803228 i received calls from people interested in my new business within hours of paying for a submission
8803229 generally most jewellery companies have a counter or two for diamonds while gold jewellery occupies 80 of the counter space we believe that from mine to market gold and diamonds are handled very differently it is only at the retail end that the two were merged till now c krishniah chetty amp sons decided to separate the gold jewellery and diamond jewellery into two full showrooms
8803230 in india c krishniah chetty amp sons are the first signature designers who have created exclusive verticals for its gold and diamond business fronts to offer specialization greater depth and a focused customer interface this is likely to foster growth and change the face of the industry and is a path breaking effort in creating two specialist businesses
8803231 great site great service i started submitting my press releases through mediasyndicate com over four years ago and never looked back the site has always delivered reliable and consistent results for my clients
8803232 the fast turnaround and extra attention they paid to my submissions was well worth the money
8803233 i received calls from people interested in my new business within hours of paying for a submission
8803234 we clearly have a long way to go what is lacking is that businesses are failing to investigate the wider opportunities that legislation presents its not all doom and gloom companies can work smarter but only if they know what they are dealing with and what to look for
8803235 technology represents one important way in which businesses can effectively reduce their carbon footprint their overheads and their exposure to rising fuel prices simple steps such as ip based video conferencing and flexible working can reduce fuel expenditure and also improve overall efficiency by removing the need for unnecessary travel
8803236 ict equipment can have a high carbon footprint and so looking at the overall lifecycle of your business infrastructure is as important as designing effective travel policies the problem is that companies tend to make decisions based on immediate costs that they can measure today whats needed instead is to adopt a longer term view taking into consideration economic social and environmental responsibilities from the initial design stage through to the management and eventual sustainable removal of the ict infrastructure
8803237 the launch was meant to be in london but i said no
8803238 i said please can i go to manchester instead i love manchester its got a really good feel to it so i thought why not i usually spend a lot of time in london im really excited about coming back because of course its where i met david manchesters just so fashion conscious and theres great shopping
8803239 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8803240 this is definitely one of the biggest honors for me
8803241 a third of all cases of cerebral palsy are associated with preterm birth
8803242 this study shows a significant reduction in cerebral palsy among preterm infants whose mothers were given magnesium sulfate
8803243 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to date that looked at using this inexpensive and commonly used treatment to reduce the occurrence of cerebral palsy after preterm birth
8803244 cerebral palsy cant always be prevented but the data from our study and its predecessors will help obstetricians make informed treatment decisions for the women under their care
8803245 our results show that obstetricians can use magnesium sulfate which they have experience prescribing to reduce the risk of a devastating condition cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8803246 so how do you think your boys are gonna do this fall
8803247 im hopeful but we have a new offensive coordinator new defensive coordinator and new offense so its tough to say
8803248 getting shots may seem burdensome and even downright scary to some children but they protect children against dangerous and deadly diseases
8803249 because of the success of vaccines american parents and healthcare providers have less experience than ever before with infectious diseases such as polio and measles
8803250 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market
8803251 at this time justification for use of thiazolidinediones is very weak to non existent
8803252 further compound their already increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease
8803253 represent conditions that are major precursors of congestive heart failure
8803254 we reported in the journal diabetes care in june 2007 that thiazolidinediones doubled the risk of congestive heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes
8803255 the increased heart failure appears to be a class effect
8803256 the unfavorable findings from the three trials have not been fully realized by the medical community
8803257 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8803258 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8803259 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8803260 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8803261 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8803262 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example
8803263 writing is a way to end up thinking something you couldnt have started out thinking
8803264 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8803265 health inequity really is a matter of life and death
8803266 but health systems will not naturally gravitate towards equity unprecedented leadership is needed that compels all actors including those beyond the health sector to examine their impact on health primary health care which integrates health in all of governments policies is the best framework for doing so
8803267 central to the commissions recommendations is creating the conditions for people to be empowered to have freedom to lead flourishing lives nowhere is lack of empowerment more obvious than in the plight of women in many parts of the world health suffers as a result following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people
8803268 water borne diseases are not caused by a lack of antibiotics but by dirty water and by the political social and economic forces that fail to make clean water available to all heart disease is caused not by a lack of coronary care units but by lives people lead which are shaped by the environments in which they live obesity is not caused by moral failure on the part of individuals but by the excess availability of high fat and high sugar foods
8803269 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8803270 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8803271 it is wonderful to have global endorsement of the australian closing the gap campaign from the csdh established by the who the csdh sets closing the gap as a goal for the whole world and produces the evidence on how health inequities are a reflection of the way we organize society and distribute power and resources the good news from the csdh for australia is that it provides plenty of ideas on how to set an agenda that will tackle the underlying determinants of health and create a healthier australia for all of us
8803272 canada likes to brag that for seven years in a row the united nations voted us
8803273 a fairer world will be a healthier world a health service and medical interventions are just one of the factors that influence population health the growth of inequalities and the phenomena of increased injustice in health is present in low and middle income countries as well as across europe it would be a crime not to take every action possible to reduce them
8803274 the report suggests avenues for action from the local to national and global levels it has been eagerly awaited by policy makers health officials grassroot activists and their community based organizations much of the research and evidence is of particular relevance to the south east asian region where too many people struggle daily for justice and equity in health the report will inspire the region to act and develop new policies and programmes
8803275 a man should not be concerned with whether he has enough possessions but whether possessions have been equally distributed
8803276 the who commission addresses one of the major issues of our global world health inequity the reports recommendations will be perceived utilized and implemented as a major policy agenda at national and global levels the issue will increase in importance as the general public become more engaged via civil society movements and multi stakeholder involvement
8803277 according to the islamic ideology social justice became a priority when the islamic revolution materialized in iran establishing a solid primary health care network in our country not only improved our health statistics but it was an excellent vehicle to move towards health equity now through the final report of the csdh and implementing its recommendations we need to move much faster in our own country toward health equity
8803278 the commission on social determinants of health report will help african leaders adapt their national development strategies to address the challenges to health these are derived from the current systemic changes taking place in the global economy that affects heavily on the poorest segments of africas population
8803279 the primary object of development for any country and for the world as a whole is the elimination of unfreedoms that reduce and impoverish the lives of people central to human deprivation is the failure of the capability to live long and healthy lives this is much more than a medical problem it relates to handicaps that have deep social roots under michael marmots leadership this who commission has concentrated on the badly neglected causal linkages that have to be adequately understood and remedied a fuller understanding is also a call for action
8803280 the united states of america spends more on health care than any other country in the world yet it ranks 41st in terms of life expectancy new orleans and its experience with hurricane katrina illustrate why we need to target social determinants of health sdh including housing education working and learning conditions and whether people are exposed to toxins better than any place i can think of right now by targeting the sdh we can rapidly move towards closing the gap that unfairly and avoidably separates the health status of groups of different socio economic status social exclusion experience and educational background

8803282 countries of the world are presently growing apart in health terms this is very worrying in many countries in the world social differences in health are also growing and this is true in europe we have been one sidedly focused on economic growth disregarding negative consequences for health and climate we need to think differently about development

8803289 the dramas not only flayed the practice of female infanticide but also opposed practices like a son lighting the funeral pyre

8803294 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8803295 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
8803296 one way this has become like a football game a yelling idiot behind my row ejected by cops applause for this blends with applause for some obama zinger about affordable health care
8803297 businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs
8803298 now i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8803299 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes
8803300 instead it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
8803301 im a dude i dont care what you say shut your nasty ass up i can hear you
8803302 i will go through the federal budget line by line

8803309 its good to have a guide especially for the big city if you get lost nobody will help you
8803310 it was always sweet to me to learn to teach and to write
8803311 a history of the early years of england succinct yet often warm with life business like and yet childlike in its tone at once practical and spiritual simply just and the work of a true scholar breathing love to god and man we owe to bede alone the knowledge of much that is most interesting in our early history
8803312 that almost all knowledge of past events was buried in the same grave with him
8803313 to explain a little more fully what i have heard from my lord alfred
8803314 when i had come into his presence at the royal vill called leonaford i was honourably received by him and remained that time with him at his court about eight months during which i read to him whatever books he liked and such as he had at hand for this is his most usual custom both night and day amid his many other occupations of mind and body either himself to read books or to listen whilst others read them
8803315 but alfred as we have been told by those who were present and would not tell an untruth marched up promptly with his men to give them battle for king ethelred remained a long time in his tent in prayer
8803316 that book in the british language which walter archdeacon of oxford brought out of britainy
8803317 when the horse bucephalus was offered in sale to philip at the price of thirteen talents 2518 15s
8803318 philip at first took no notice of this but upon the princes often repeating the same expression and showing great uneasiness he said young man you find fault with your elders as if you knew more than they or could manage the horse better
8803319 if you should not be able to ride him what forfeiture will you submit for your rashness
8803320 upon this all the company laughed but the king and prince agreeing as to the forfeiture alexander ran to the horse and laying hold on the bridle turned him to the sun for he had observed it seems that the shadow which fell before the horse and continually moved as he moved greatly disturbed him
8803321 philip and all his court were in great distress for him at first and a profound silence took place but when the prince had turned him and brought him safe back they all received him with loud exclamations except his father who wept for joy and kissing him said seek another kingdom my son that may be worthy of thy abilities for macedonia is too small for thee
8803322 outlines of dates and facts or as collections of romantic stories with little coherence and less result on the fortunes of the country
8803323 is reluctant to introduce his book by any such repellent title as a summary or an outline of english history such titles seem on the face of them to imply that the element of interest and the romance inseparable from the life and doings of individuals are excluded and that an amplified chronological table has been made to do duty for history but to read english history and fail to realise that it is replete with interest sparkling with episode and full of dramatic incident is to miss all the pleasure and most of the instruction which its study if properly pursued can give
8803324 replete with interest sparkling with episode and full of dramatic incident
8803325 children can never be fully compensated for injuries inflicted by adults
8803326 a childs innocence is taken and then you throw some dollars at him and say here this is to make up for all the shortcomings
8803327 you cant go forward with the rogue employee theory that one person at dhs was acting outside the norm you have to show that malfeasance was widely known and ignored
8803328 we tried to fix neglect in a dhs system which is designed to remedy neglect of family and parents
8803329 in 1990 dhs literally didnt know where the kids they were supposed to be caring for were and their case loads were dramatically high
8803330 an ongoing effort to be the best they can be
8803331 i dont like to fight and do dumb stuff and get locked up
8803332 its really just to give people a place to skate
8803333 the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8803334 oooooo did you hear what he said about president bush
8803335 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8803336 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8803337 there was the time duchovny confessed to a reporter about his fascination with hotel porn i like to watch other people k was the exact quote and rumors swirled that he was a sex addict
8803338 my wife and i have seven children and we consider it our chief responsibility to raise our children in the context of our faith without being paranoid or over sheltering we have decided that for our family that means church attendance and family prayers as well as homeschooling and living without television
8803339 christians of all people should be celebrating the harry potter novels and the attendant potter mania the potter books are the most edifying works of fiction written in many years as any classicist medievalist or lover of traditional english plays and novels might tell you
8803340 the beloved disciple tells us that god is love 1 john 4 8 we see in each harry potter novel that it is this love within harry by the sacrificial love of his mom and in the symbols of christ around him that every year raises him up from underground in victory over death harry potters story is gods plan and our hope
8803341 if you are like me you grew up with the idea that reading was entertainment and diversion and anything but life changing this idea really only in currency for the last seventy or eighty years is a gross misconception anthropologists historians of religion and professors of literature will all tell you that the rule in traditional cultures and even in cultures such as ours is that story in whatever form is meant to instruct and change us
8803342 christ never conforms to the prejudices of his his times or shrinks to being a respecter of persons or position his disciples are called to a no less heroic position and the harry potter books in their satire of worldly institutions and exposure of our rush to judge and condemn point to this life in christ
8803343 harry like saint paul knows that physical death is not the greatest evil living a soulless existence in fear of death is the true death of the human spirit and the greater evil
8803344 when i am asked if i think these books are safe for people especially children to read i do not hesitate yes i think these books are safe and beyond that they let us experience loves victory over death in story form
8803345 we participate imaginatively with the characters when they make good choices and this reading experience positively influences the decision making in our own lives sort of like vitamins for the soul
8803346 dissolution purification and perfection the three stages of the alchemical great work and of changing the human soul from lead to gold are reflected in harrys transformations
8803347 it is implicit in human design that we long for christ and the experience of the great story
8803348 i have the right to steal from my fellow humans i am delegating this right to the state who will steal from other people and give some of the proceeds to me
8803349 i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral this will show her true colors
8803350 thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick
8803351 what you are saying that we will go to detective
8803352 chain is right we should go to the detective and give him the key then after 2 3 days the detective will get to know whos key is this
8803353 hi we got this key from road want to know whose key is this can you tell me that whos key is this
8803354 they are six men and they got a key from the road and thy want to know whos key is that
8803355 vane these are six criminals take them to the police station
8803356 you get a lot of theres a good camaraderie you actually get a lot of good friends in there its a lot of fun
8803357 a few hours before it happened i was throwin punches back and fourth with the guy and then find out that is pretty crazy
8803358 they get involved in some sort of team activity that keeps them out of trouble and occupies their time doing something theyre training so they have some sort of goal
8803359 i used to get in a lot of trouble back in the days id get in a lot of fights and stuff with friends and school rivalries and ever since ive started this i havent been doing any of that
8803360 like every other fighter youre kinda mad when you lose mad at your self because you did something wrong or you could have done better at something
8803361 damion i know he wasnt upset about his loss that night he wanted to fight again
8803362 its not like he was mad at me or the promoters or anyone else
8803363 the focus of our talks shall shift from the armed groups to the communities the parameters governing our negotiations shall be a balance between the constitutionality and public sentiment
8803364 we will not sign the memorandum of agreement on the ancestral domain but will continue with further negotiations with the milf to arrive at final peace deal
8803365 it is already a done deal and we have been saying this all the time we will not revisit or renegotiate the agreement on the ancestral domain
8803366 it is really unfortunate that the philippine government again reneged on the ancestral domain deal which is the product of long and arduous work of the peace negotiators
8803367 they are attacking us and milf forces have been ordered to defend themselves
8803368 this is a punitive action against rogue milf members and this operation will continue until kato and macapaar are captured
8803369 im a pool of imperfections sometimes im moody i can get angry easily i listen to my music way too loud and i dont always put a good foot forward i can snap at people but of course i dont mean to i hold things off until the last minute and sometimes i just dont want to make a first move so things go undone i can be messy confusing and even a little careless at times
8803370 promise of a land where all men are free and equal
8803371 there are those who say to you we are rushing this issue of civil rights i say we are 172 years late
8803372 the time has arrived for the democratic party to get out of the shadow of states rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights
8803373 standing up with courage and clear purpose they somehow managed to change the world
8803374 can i have a bucket with water and some rags im going to clean morutis study
8803375 international statements of concern are urgently needed to express solidarity with the victims to help forestall yet more violence and to prevent the further loss of life
8803376 we therefore request that you make a statement to call for an end to the sectarian violence and for the protection of vulnerable communities as soon as possible
8803377 mobs have been attacking minority christians in retaliation for the killing of local religious leader swami lakhmananda saraswati
8803378 the fact that christians have been made the scapegoats and victims of a vishwa hindu parishad backlash is deplorable and calls for urgent intervention
8803379 if you sow the wind you reap the whirl wind aurthur
8803380 im a pool of imperfections sometimes im moody i can get angry easily i listen to my music way too loud and i dont always put a good foot forward i can snap at people but of course i dont mean to i hold things off until the last minute and sometimes i just dont want to make a first move so things go undone i can be messy confusing and even a little careless at times
8803381 i mean youve got the first sort of mainstream african american who is articulate
8803382 im guilty of overcompensation lost in my own translation i apologize i know i should listen to your heart
8803383 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8803384 der autor schreibt viel ber fahrr der und fahrradfahren unter anderem der autor dieses blog wohnt zudem in meiner gegend soda ich nachvollziehen kann rtlich und r umlich ber was er schreibt schrottie
8803385 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8803386 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8803387 that is not the same thing as having health insurance
8803388 so instead of producing worthless statistics that people fling around in vacuous editorials and pointless debates the census bureau should produce meaningful numbers identifying all of the sources of funds people will draw on if they need medical care
8803389 people are working harder than ever but the jobs they have dont provide health insurance
8803390 ironically this all happened while the president was trying to cut back on medicaid
8803391 dear burt while you always had quite a flair for the dramatic you never had much regard for the truth apparently you cant be bothered to read anything carefully maybe that is why you like oreilly make half your crap up glad to hear you finally got sober
8803392 great food is like great sex the more you have the more you want
8803393 patriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves it
8803394 a democracy is nothing more than mob rule where fifty one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty nine
8803395 those who desire to give up freedom in order to gain security will not have nor do they deserve either one
8803396 you may say im a dreamer but im not the only one i hope someday you will join us and the world will live as one
8803397 during the times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
8803398 patriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves it
8803399 a democracy is nothing more than mob rule where fifty one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty nine
8803400 those who desire to give up freedom in order to gain security will not have nor do they deserve either one
8803401 you may say im a dreamer but im not the only one i hope someday you will join us and the world will live as one
8803402 stillness is our most intense mode of action it is in our moments of deep quiet that is born every idea emotion and drive which we eventually honor with the name of action our most emotionally active life is lived in our dreams and our cells renew themselves most industriously in sleep we reach highest in meditation and farthest in prayer in stillness every human being is great he is free from the experience of hostility he is a poet and most like an angel
8803403 the sort of thing that keeps you up at night
8803404 that the rounded rock marked with parallel scratches calls up as much poetry in an ignorant mind as in the mind of the geologist who knows that over this rock a glacier slid a million of years ago the truth is that those who have never entered on scientific pursuits are blind to most of the poetry by which they are surrounded whoever has not in youth collected plants and insects knows not half the halo of interest which lanes and hedgerows can assume
8803405 the object of the present volume is to present chapters to be read in school or at home that shall materially widen the outlook of american schoolchildren in the domain of science and of the applications of science to the arts and to daily life
8803406 the sciences of astronomy physics chemistry meteorology and physiography are treated as fully and as deeply as the conditions permit and the lessons that they teach are enforced by examples taken from familiar and important things
8803407 familiar phenomena like those of steam of shadows of reflected light of musical instruments of echoes etc are referred to their fundamental causes whenever it is desirable simple experiments are described and fully illustrated and all such experiments can very well be repeated in the schoolroom the volume is the result of a sincere belief that much can be done to aid young children to comprehend the material world in which they live and of a desire to have a part in a work so very well worth doing

8803409 it may surprise some who read carefully the above list that such subjects should have been taught to the children of a rural elementary school but it is an undeniable fact that they were taught in kings somborne school and so successfully that the children were both interested and benefited by the teaching mr dawes in answer to the objection that such subjects are above the comprehension of the young said the distinguishing mark of natures laws is their extreme simplicity it may doubtless require intellect of a high order to make the discovery of these laws yet once evolved they are within the capacity of a child in short the principles of natural philosophy are the principles of common sense and if taught in a simple and common sense way they will be speedily understood and eagerly attended to by children and it will be found that with pupils of even from ten to twelve years of age much may be done towards forming habits of observation and inquiry such a fact i think suggests some valuable practical lessons for those who have the responsibility of deciding what subjects to include in an educational system for children

8803432 looking at it athletically we have a chance of a stage win in the 11 flat stages
8803433 in light of the competition there that surely wont be as easy as at the tour de france but maybe at the vuelta i will be luck enough to catch a perfect sprint in this season i unexpectedly rode the giro ditalia when we lost alessandro petacchi since the tour and the vuelta have long been part of my season planning i can go ahead and live out my long year plan of one time riding all three grand tours in one year
8803434 etre bon quilibr cela exige souvent un long travail on dit souvent quon est d termin g n tiquement quil y a une tr s grande part de fatalit dans chaque homme mais on peut travailler cette fatalit l quilibre cest une force int rieure on doit avoir vaincu pour y arriver pas n cessairement avoir v cu des drames moi je nen ai jamais connu mais il faut avoir vaincu des courants qui sont en soi et qui vous poussent vers lespoir ou le d sespoir
8803435 souvent je me pose la question est ce le r sultat ou la cause en tous les cas pour moi cest une histoire damour qui d passe largement la raison
8803436 moi par exemple je sais que je dois travailler la tol rance la bont jenvie ceux qui ont cette d marche spontan e daller vers les autres de les aider dans ce domaine ma femme par exemple est bien meilleure que moi moi cela me demande un effort daider les gens de rendre visite ou de t l phoner quelquun qui est seul je ne suis pas naturellement bon en m me temps si je deviens meilleur ce sera gr ce moi car je travaille plus quun autre pour tre bon dautres ont ce don spontan mais les hommes politiques eux ont souvent tendance se pr occuper mes il faut avoir un certain ego pour faire de la politique un ego que lon cultive car on est dans un monde tr s concurrentiel cela suscite des jalousies chez des gens qui veulent votre t te dans dautres partis ou le plus souvent dans votre propre parti
8803437 je d teste les gens qui parlent trop spontan ment mes je naime pas parler de moi et j prouve de la g ne la place des gens qui se confient ainsi je trouve cela grotesque lentourage des hommes politiques est capital sinon on perd cet quilibre et on devient la caricature de nous m mes certains de mes coll gues finissent par croire quils sont importants cest invraisemblable moi jai des fonctions importantes mais je ne suis pas important

8803441 itll be hard because im not in as good shape as this time last year or the year before that where i came directly from a great tour de france this year theres been a couple of weeks extra gap in between the two races because of the olympics which means my form has had to last that much longer
8803442 furthermore ive done a lot of races and been close to top form ever since giro ditalia and going on to tour de suisse and tour de france so im a bit worn out right now ive also spent some extra time with my family after the olympics because ive been away so much over the summer
8803443 yeah its quite weird to think of i really like this race so im definitely gonna do my very best to win or alternatively help one of my teammates to win it

8803451 it was the dedication to excellence by both the equipment sponsors and the team that made it happen
8803452 since its inception cerv los focus has been on r amp d with a strategy built on four pillars theoretical analysis lab testing materials and manufacturing research and road and race testing
8803453 cerv lo testteam will race as a professional cycling team with a continental pro standing
8803454 currently pro cyclists are judged only by their racing results which places a lot of pressure on them to perform race performance is only one component of cerv lo testteam our riders will also be involved in field testing and providing technical feedback in addition they will participate in activities with our customers making them more accessible to cycling fans
8803455 as a partner of the womens team we have seen their very high level of professionalism and their impressive results
8803456 so it was a natural decision to use the current platform and reinforce it with additional staff

8803487 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8803488 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8803489 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8803490 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8803491 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8803492 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8803493 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8803494 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8803495 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8803496 at this point if russia were to walk back from certain agreements they have made it would clearly delay any future aspirations they have of joining the world trade organization

8803508 local school boards can now breathe a sigh of relief the state board of education threw them under the bus last month by refusing to adopt the clear specific standards schools need to give the bible the respect it deserves and help them stay out of court now schools wont be required to maneuver through a legal minefield without a map
8803509 texas schools are required to have some type of instruction in the bible which is the hebrew scriptures and new testament
8803510 schools are not required to offer a particular type of course in order to meet the requirement of having some type of instruction in the bible but they have to offer something
8803511 we warned the owner that his dogs are too mean and sure enough look what happened today
8803512 we looked at it and have made the decision to relocate that stop
8803513 we cross the street back and forth going to the store going to catch the bus
8803514 so id rather take my chance crossing in the middle because i have a little bit more room to maneuver you know if theyre coming at me i can stop dodge back and forth but its hard crossing the roads around here
8803515 i think what weve built into this process is multiple opportunities for awareness

8803520 dr realini has such a proven track record of effectiveness that she could open a hot dog stand and i think i would want to invest in it
8803521 shes just terrific she gets good and productive work done
8803522 although i hate to see her leave a key position i think that were at the level now that we really need to work with our schools and more with the policy setting agenda particularly with dissemination of information
8803523 i urge texans along the coast to monitor this storm closely heed warnings from their local leaders and take necessary precautions to protect their families homes and businesses

8803527 i used to come out here on saturday morning and wash my truck and watch the kids playing
8803528 from this street to the next to the next to the next to the next five blocks deep everything was gone
8803529 there was nothing to put mr ramos or any of the other employees on notice that they were even potentially subject to having their calls monitored
8803530 the other thing that struck me frankly was just how foolish it was on their part
8803531 mr ruiz is an attorney and he should know that
8803532 there is no expectation of privacy by any employee at bexarmet
8803533 to remain uninvolved in every way in matters involving the termination of the general manager
8803534 so it took a lot of courage for him to do this
8803535 mr ramos is hopeful with the change in control over there that bexarmet is trying to clean up its act and they should welcome this as an opportunity to clean things out
8803536 sen mccain has always been sensitive to national crisis in the 2000 race he postponed his announcement for president because of the situation in the balkans we are monitoring the situation very closely

8803552 a much larger landslip could come down very quickly bringing thousands of tonnes of debris on to the road and affect properties

8803555 while we make a huge noise about zimbabwe and the mugabe regime on the other hand we are moving further down the path of integrating our economy with dictatorships closer to home like myanmar
8803556 the difference seems to be its ok when there is money in it for us the generals of myanmar will be laughing all the way to the bank
8803557 the importance of concluding this fta goes beyond simply trade benefits the agreement is also critical to new zealands longer term strategic engagement and interactions with the asia pacific region
8803558 its a great outcome for new zealands trade future given the asean economies are some of the fastest growing and most significant in the world

8803562 she did everything she could for people and loved animals and you couldnt have wished for a kinder more sincere person
8803563 the injuries suffered by this man are horrific extreme violence has been used it is among the worst beatings that i have seen for a long time

8803566 der unverminderte trend zum exzessiven alkoholkonsum durch kinder und jugendliche ist alarmierend es muss von staatlicher und von kommunaler seite aber nat rlich auch von den eltern alles unternommen werden hier entscheidend gegenzusteuern
8803567 mit dem alkoholkonsum steigt auch die bereitschaft zur gewalt was wiederum zunehmende deliktszahlen im bereich der k rperverletzungen bei minderj hrigen zur folge hat
8803568 die zunahme bei den gewaltdelikten unter alkoholeinflu durch jugendliche zeigt sich im landkreis hameln pyrmont zwar nicht so gravierend wie auf landesebene dennoch f hren wir weiter gezielte kontrollen mit dem jugendamt und den kommunen an jugendtreffpunkten und bei ffentlichen veranstaltungen durch
8803569 wir wissen dass kinder und jugendliche au erhalb des eigentlichen veranstaltungsraumes alkoholische auch hochprozentige getr nke verzehren und werden daher auch im umfeld kinder und jugendliche zielgerichtet berpr fen
8803570 wir raten allen eltern daher mit ihren kindern das gespr ch zu suchen
8803571 sprechen sie deutlich ber die gefahren und konsequenzen von unerlaubtem oder berm igem alkoholkonsum

8803573 mfe legal will be contacting you separately on this matter as we have concerns over the use of this consent condition
8803574 even when the council offered to pay for the tests itself mfe continued to use lawyers to try and stop them
8803575 we were always recognising that there could be people that were affected and that was what motivated our actions
8803576 the parliamentary commissioner for the environment suggested another thing we couldve done was a review of the consent but we were trying to deal with the potential issue
8803577 all we were seeking was reassurance that it wasnt a problem
8803578 freedom of speech doesnt protect speech that you like freedom of speech protects speech that you hate
8803579 this gravel is un driveable with hard tyres without any cuts the start of the stage was okay but got worse
8803580 when i have that kind of rhythm on these flowing roads it feels as if i dont need to push too hard the roads have dried more quickly than we thought and its slippery in the loose gravel but i dont think road position is making too much difference
8803581 although i made a few small mistakes my driving was more precise and much better
8803582 the roads are quite dry but where it is wet the tracks are really slippery theyre not cleaning up as much as i thought
8803583 injuries to subjects and police officers were minor despite the serious circumstances of incidents
8803584 the majority identified the potential risk of injuries or fatalities
8803585 officers felt that the taser filled a gap in their options for safely dealing with these situations
8803586 there is the potential to realise benefits such as a reduction in firearms presentations assaults on police officers and injuries to subjects if tasers were available more widely as a tactical option
8803587 i am a christian and i think the foundation of christs teachings are the beatitudes
8803588 great but didnt christ mention hell more than anyone else in the bible
8803589 what about the more difficult teachings in the sermon on the mount about judgement and hell divorce etc
8803590 paul was accepted by the body of christ as both an apostle and a great teacher about christ
8803591 the bible was written by men living in a particular culture and i just do not accept that god would send someone to hell do miracles etc
8803592 there are many other parts to christian tradition than the bible as canonized by constantine in the 4th century
8803593 but if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to have a huge millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the open sea

8803603 das ruhrgebiet mausert sich zur klasse forschungslandschaft f r spitzenmedizin
8803604 wir haben uns zu einer modellregion f r innovative konzepte der integrierten versorgung und der dazugeh rigen it entwickelt
8803605 auf diese weise entsteht ein integrierter behandlungsansatz mit gemeinsamen therapieempfehlungen durchgehender qualit tssicherung und ausgesch pften effizienzreserven

8803610 one of the things he said was that he had found in research that the people who already had a luxury car were in some ways more receptive to genesis than those who did not have a luxury car the people who had luxury cars realized it wasnt a life changer for them while those who did not have a luxury car yet were the ones who were striving for prestige
8803611 its usually very expensive to establish a separate dealership network for a new brand
8803612 but i also think you can stretch a brand so far to be offering vehicles that cost 10 000 or 20 0000 and others for 40 000 is quite a stretch
8803613 were not even validating such an outrageous and preposterous claim with a comment
8803614 the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall be watered also himself

8803618 plus if youre doing nothing but scanning hundreds of rss feeds and reading purely to be entertained youre at a disadvantage someone in your niche or industry is likely reading books and reading deeper to become the higher authority
8803619 but being able to recall and regurgitate information is low level learning compared with insightful understanding bloggers are big on regurgitation
8803620 they need you to do the work for them because they dont want to become an expert
8803621 even more painful is when someone writes a responsive post that clearly misses the entire point of the original article
8803622 reading at its fundamental essence is not about absorbing information
8803623 its easy to make a difficult book and difficult to make an easy book
8803624 its about asking questions looking for answers understanding the various answers and deciding for yourself

8803633 our decision to take this step is not a happy one

8803639 we probably should use what the actual name is said mississippi gov
8803640 we should afford them the respect that they are entitled and call them by their legal name
8803641 we can relax now but please be cautious they might return soon
8803642 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8803643 from now on it will be stickier our political rallying will get stronger because more of our supporters from upcountry will come to help us we will not back down
8803644 we can withstand any difficult conditions if we can topple samak
8803645 if you leave the government house that means we have been defeated
8803646 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8803647 the onus is on the bulgarian authorities to show the judicial system works
8803648 i find it very worrying that the bulgarian authorities are closing this case
8803649 it is up to the bulgarian secret services now to show they can operate on the level of a western service an ally of eu and nato and track down the murderer

8803656 the unprecedented increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate
8803657 the price of oil resulted in our fuel bill jumping by nearly 50 million in one year and we could not recover that from passengers who had already booked their flights
8803658 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying even as late as yesterday we had secured a new investment package but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8803659 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8803660 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8803661 i just feel like for this moment that we can we would be crazy not to its such an amazing medium its such an interesting process

8803663 i dont think any one show can save the fall but i think a great show is something that we all want so i look forward to seeing the reaction
8803664 the biggest challenge was trying to make it relevant to now to do it despite it being star trek he said
8803665 its a question of how do you make it something that would be what it wants it to be even if it hasnt been a series before you invest completely in the characters and you tell a story that is good regardless of the setting
8803666 really i was surprised in high school how quickly people made decisions about you
8803667 i never thought first impressions would count as much as they did in high school but they count for a lot overcoming that is really something you have to work toward
8803668 in the long run of life you probably wont remember most people you knew in high school in 10 years time
8803669 get to know everyone networking is important in high school too
8803670 the value of high school is that it lets you find out who you are now im just me

8803687 spider man 3 ended just find a way to replace kirsten dunst with bryce dallas howard or im not going to go see your movie
8803688 a petabyte is a thousand terabytes which is a million gigabytes or a billion megabytes or 8 billion mega
8803689 so if you had a half megabit per second internet connection which is relatively high in the us relatively low compared to residential bandwidth available in say korea itd take you 16 billion seconds or 266 million minutes or 507 years to transmit the data
8803690 faster to send a petabyte of data from san francisco to hong kong by sailboat than by the internet
8803691 argentina flaunts the dubious merit of being the first country in history to judge its victorious soldiers

8803695 the diaper opened and the baby fell to the ground but at a much slower speed

8803702 you have done what most people want to do but do not have enough courage to do
8803703 we need a president who will put barney smith before smith barney
8803704 the oil and coal industry have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for all it is worth
8803705 i see a sea of flags i wonder if the folks at red state can spot them
8803706 a channel with the convention in hd where i wouldnt have to listen to the blabbering idiots what is
8803707 what is so strange about this to me is the i actually thought chuck todd was going to be different its almost as if he agrees because its coming from tom brokaws clap trap
8803708 so why is this election so close i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents there is no better example than the climate crisis were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8803709 i want a president who will put barney smith before smith barney
8803710 barack obama will put barney smith ahead of smith barney
8803711 when penny pinching media could use the money to cover more important news
8803712 its something that hasnt been done before and the usa says whoever comes up with something can keep it
8803713 he says he will follow him to the gates of hell but he will not even follow him to the cave where he lives
8803714 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8803715 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8803716 john mccain says hed follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8803717 well it was not at all a great speech but it was exceedingly smart
8803718 chuck todd was claiming the rethugs dont know how to respond to the speech
8803719 if i was any republican in the world tonite id be pissing my pants
8803720 if we tax the people making 300k or more we will destroy the economy
8803721 is it true that the secret weapon the republicans have been holding back is tim pawlenty
8803722 dont forget rachel maddow who is still being underutilized for the dnc as she was for the live primary coverage despite her now having her own show imho
8803723 the guy who vetoed the funding for infrastructure a year before the i 35 bridge collapsed and killed a bunch of people
8803724 who is this guy and where did he come from
8803725 yeah for example a mass outbreak of the trots caused by an e coli contamination that the fda didnt have the resources to detect early enough due to republican budget cuts
8803726 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8803727 i had so many dreams about what my daughter would be like youve never been the helpmate and friend i thought youd be
8803728 whaaat should i pretend this was a date in honor of my birthday wtf
8803729 were all americans and we all have different opinions but were still united under the same flag
8803730 honey breakfast is on the stove i left early to go shopping love you
8803731 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states
8803732 that united states citizens were present in the combat zone that means only one thing that they could be there only on the direct instruction of their leadership
8803733 what was the gentlemans purpose of being among the special forces and what he is doing today i so far cannot answer
8803734 its to help kids and community its not pick and choose whos rich whos poor its for everybody and it pulls the people and community together too

8803741 the hyogo prefectural institute of technology recently presented jp a humanoid robot that is programmed to walk like a fashion model the researchers claim they used materials easily available anywhere for the development of the robot which comes with a frame made of aluminum the manekin robotto fashion model robot stands just 160cm tall which might not be enough to let it run on cat walks instead of real models weighing a more realistic 30kg it moves through 16 joints and motorized cylinders built into its body the robot is able to cross and bend its legs just as human models are supposed to do
8803742 it is the time the mood and the energy that makes the story and no matter where you stand there is something to discover each time you look at the painting

8803746 in general my role as an artist is to express lighthearted social criticism the arts have a role to play in social critique
8803747 all of the styles are very different and personal yet each piece works on its own
8803748 all the faculty have such diverse media and content area
8803749 the big muddy festival draws a big crowd every labor day weekend
8803750 there will definitely be a lot of people down there for that
8803751 i would probably think it would be better to hang out than try leaving right after the game
8803752 the bridge is going to be completely replaced because it is old and visibly worn
8803753 first we start with field investigation which means we look at the different areas and try to come up with the best possible options for creating these paths what we are doing tonight is showing columbia the best possible option that we have come up with
8803754 now we are in the phase where we use the input that community members have and start putting it to work
8803755 projects along high speed roads have to be well thought out
8803756 theres a great deal of public attention where there are issues of safety at intersections
8803757 green meadows is a terrible intersection but it seems as though they have successfully pulled the trail away from the most dangerous part
8803758 situations are often more complicated than they are made to seem
8803759 they always say theyre going to do one thing and turn around and do another
8803760 i wish id had the chance at that id be way ahead
8803761 its going to be a difficult year to figure out who to vote for im waiting to see what everybody offers to see what to do
8803762 my first election was in 1958 when you had to vote a straight ticket i was so glad when that was outlawed i like to vote for the person not the party
8803763 im more comfortable with mccain because of his prison experience
8803764 were there now weve got to figure out a way
8803765 but if they dont want a democracy we have to accept that

8803770 weve had eight years of the republican party and its time for a change
8803771 one of the most gifted and abominable personages in an era that knew no lack of gifted and abominable personages
8803772 in the period of which we speak there reigned in the cities a stench barely conceivable to us modern men and women the streets stank of manure the courtyards of urine the stairwells stank of moldering wood and rat droppings the kitchens of spoiled cabbage and mutton fat the unaired parlors stank of stale dust the bedrooms of greasy sheets damp featherbeds and the pungently sweet aroma of chamber pots
8803773 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering cabin adjacent to the second main cabin doors
8803774 multiple criminal acts including bombings and attacks against iraqi targets
8803775 if its right that theyve arrested the man who was in charge i will sue him
8803776 this incident shows the need for an end to the random arrest of iraqis by the american forces which are against the human rights outlined in the constitution it proves for a fact that each iraqi might be arrested or put in prison without knowing the reasons
8803777 no headquarters this isnt our man this is ben franklin
8803778 we can actually do our work in some ways we are very very happy
8803779 i am fearful of the 36 hour hold in minneapolis
8803780 i havent heard anything about any organized targeting but with individual officers preventive detention is not out of the realm of possibility
8803781 generally in the past police officers target convergence space spaces where activists tend to gather before big events
8803782 the police dont really do anything but ask a lot of questions and say things like we are watching you and we know you are with this group or that group or you know this person and this person is on our list
8803783 we have also seen visiting by police officers of individuals at their homes and businesses in an attempt to intimidate
8803784 isnt well schooled and prepared to be president of the united states

8803794 this tragedy we are living in mexico city is going to spread to other states
8803795 this decision was in regard to mexico citys legislative assembly but in the end it establishes a precedent that can be applied to other local lawmaking bodies

8803806 he presented a clear and eloquent case for why this country so desperately needs change and why he is supremely capable by his experience his judgment and his temperament to lead this country to a new day
8803807 i think if somebody wasnt moved by his speech they dont have a pulse
8803808 in the operation the west conducted on georgian soil against russia south ossetians were the victims or hostages of it we can see a rehearsal for an attack on iran
8803809 t he likelihood of a war against iran was growing with each passing day
8803810 there was a strong element of what miliband does best preaching democracy to new democracies which are more than converted to the principle while asking for little in return for his praise that would be awkward for them to give
8803811 david miliband the foreign secretary also flew to ukraine to assemble the
8803812 a former british ambassador to tbilisi said that nato might have to send troops to the region
8803813 i think we shouldnt be too complacent or too scared in a situation like this
8803814 he suggested that a peacekeeping force made up of troops from the us britain france germany and russia should be sent to georgia to replace the russian units
8803815 to give up and surrender and say to the russians its your backyard youve won or to put men on the ground to protect georgias sovereignty and the east west oil and gas pipeline from the caspian and central asia
8803816 nato diplomatic sources said that no one within the alliance was speaking about sending troops
8803817 he said his defence officials had told him the provocation was to benefit one of the us presidential candidates
8803818 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8803819 and so it was that a team from the vice presidents office u s security officials and others were in georgia several days before the war began
8803820 u s deputy state department spokesman robert wood said the russians without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
8803821 an immediate concern expressed by all sides involved buffer zones outside of two georgian breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia
8803822 wood is of course wrong point 5 of the signed ceasefire agreement says
8803823 russian forces must go back to positions they held prior to the outbreak of hostilities pending an international peace monitoring mechanism russian peacekeepers will take additional security measures

8803850 the most difficult problem facing north korean refugees in south korea is how to find jobs in the wake of the spy case were worried that south koreans will lose all trust in the refugees
8803851 victims of the kim jong il regimes tyranny its wrong to blame the entire community of north korean refugees just because of some north korean agents

8803853 over 30 years ago i was teaching religion to high school students in the phillips neighborhood and i was telling them to do community service works even though i knew what they had to face when they went home and they knew that i knew
8803854 then i decided i needed to start doing service work for this community and one of our biggest hurdles was housing rent could take up over 50 of a minimum wage earners salary with the help of many volunteers and donors we bought up houses on two blocks some sold for 1 or 30 000 we used a lot of duct tape to fix a lot of repairs
8803855 but the dealers would march with us with their signs reading
8803856 we outgrew our apartment and moved into a house with six bedrooms which we called st joseph house it was run from the attic where the sisters lived it was the beginning of what is now called hope community
8803857 we soon learned that people needed to rely on their own power and strength by gathering together saying what they needed and then acting on their goals
8803858 we condemn people for being homeless or poor when our wealth goes to honeywell supporting the military is not about patriotism it is about greed
8803859 although the vigils and demonstrations have focused on different weapon systems over the years the main theme has always been to reduce the military budget funding human needs peace conversion and advocating for nonviolent alternatives to violent solutions for complex problems
8803860 every wednesday morning i would go out to honeywell with a banner and a prayer they would lock us out or we would lock them out i got jailed 50 times for civil disobedience and 12 years later i was known as a civil resister
8803861 she is faithful to her cause of peace we were lawbreakers since the 17th century the beginning of our order of carondelet sisters in france some of can be activists others cannot and then some of us are just indolent

8803864 lack of access to cutting edge medical technology has significant consequences the most obvious is that a patients survival or return to full health is compromised because of a later or less sophisticated diagnosis and more invasive treatment
8803865 equally disconcerting is that canadas total healthcare expenditures are among the highest in the developed world and yet the limited inventory of advanced medical equipment found in our health care system is often old and outdated

8803868 for those people that know quinton they know that hes a very kind gentle giving person and he feels so badly about his actions
8803869 he takes complete full responsibility for what happened but he was delusional during that ride down to his friends house and really believed that it was a matter of life or death
8803870 it started for me when i was a family doctor in chanhassen i got patients to talk about what had been going in their lives and it directly contributed to why they were in my office
8803871 but they generally say that theyve dealt with it thats often times not the case
8803872 we can get to the root of most problems in about 20 minutes sometimes its longer but it doesnt matter to me my charge isnt going to be any more if i take 10 minutes or an hour
8803873 isnt well schooled and prepared to be president of the united states
8803874 there are not enough persons of color who want to be police officers
8803875 we get a huge benefit in having five or six officers at football and basketball games meeting with families
8803876 after school and weekend programming that would keep these kids off the street
8803877 if you take the juvenile crime problem away in three to four years we dont have a problem
8803878 has a lot of emerging cultures and we need to know how to deal with them
8803879 we have to compete with the honeywells and 3ms for four year degree people
8803880 there is a failure of local law enforcement to sit down and talk to the community in a positive way
8803881 i want you to do the job in my neighborhood as you do in minnetonka edina and bloomington
8803882 all we want from the police officers is to be fair
8803883 we go through three or four steps of different grievance processes while they continue to work
8803884 my discipline is on hold until the officers go through their grievance process
8803885 it slows everything way down in order for due process to take place
8803886 people were giving some real concrete concerns and they were sharing that with the police chiefs i also think that the police chiefs were giving their honest opinions in regard to what their goals were
8803887 i think cultural training is very important and i think that could possibly break down some of the barriers in terms of communication
8803888 we promise you that we will continue to pursue these issues
8803889 people responded and interacted i think we are off to a very good beginning of this process
8803890 i felt pretty good that i got my information and some ideas out and i got some information that can help me when i go back to the department tomorrow
8803891 i wished we could have been more focused on policy
8803892 but when people have the opportunity to speak to police chiefs they want to be able to say what they want to say
8803893 it is going to be important for the council the communities of color and other agencies and organizations to put forth a criminal justice agenda that is going to make a difference in 2009
8803894 i think this was a great first forum i was very impressed with the people who showed up i hope we double and triple our attendance at the next one scheduled for october

8803896 she knows when my stuff is ripening she knows her stuff about food and promoting local food
8803897 i think there is a real connection between a healthy community and keeping our money in the local economy by supporting local farmers
8803898 creating that long term relationship with the farmers is key
8803899 its very easy to work with the farmers here you just make the connection have a conversation about your needs and then put it into motion
8803900 i got the desire to get my hands back in the soil and get more in touch with the source of my food
8803901 people really appreciate the fresh alternatives they can get here
8803902 they feel like theyre getting healthy food and they feel good when they eat it they get pretty excited when they realize how fresh the food is that it was picked as recently as this morning
8803903 you have to be persistent and be willing to prove your stuff is better that what they are going to get from the distributor
8803904 you cant just show up one day and say i have a bunch of cauliflower restaurants plan their menus two weeks out
8803905 i throw the words local growers in as much as possible when communicating with the public
8803906 dine fresh dine local is a great opportunity for restaurateurs like stephanie to highlight the quality food they source from local growers
8803907 it also highlights how diners communities and the landscape can benefit when eateries partner with local growers

8803912 the main purpose in updating the 1983 double tax agreement was to strengthen co operation between the united kingdom and new zealand in the enforcement of tax laws and collection of tax
8803913 to that end the updated agreement is more closely aligned with the new oecd standard on exchange of information between tax authorities
8803914 in particular the two tax authorities are now allowed to exchange information on other taxes besides income tax and they can request assistance from each other in the recovery of tax debt
8803915 the changes are designed to help reduce tax avoidance and evasion and improve revenue collection which will be of benefit to both countries
8803916 feedback from credible users suggests that downloads on this site may contain what some people would consider adware spyware or other potentially unwanted programs
8803917 customers of 7search who have opened accounts with 7search com have later terminated that business relationship as a result of seeing mcafees false deceptive confusing and or misleading statements and representations about 7search com

8803923 if you want change it is time for latinos and for immigrants to rally behind the next president of the united states barack obama tonight i ask my friends in the latino community in the immigrant community please join me because barack obama is the change we need
8803924 w hen barack obama occupies the white house that is the community our president will defend and respect by fighting for comprehensive immigration reform reform that keeps mothers and children and families together reform that brings hard working people out of the shadows of disgrace and into the sunlight of dignity that enforces our laws keeps our borders secure and our nation safe
8803925 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at homeland security they are in charge
8803926 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states

8803928 you can always rely on him if youre under the cosh and hes done well for us again tonight

8803957 as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee biden is well versed in policy debates and carefully choreographed trips but his record on the islamic republic of iran perhaps the chief national security threat facing the next president suggests a persistent and dangerous judgment deficit
8803958 in 1998 sen biden was one of only four senators to vote against the iran missile proliferation sanctions act a bill that punished foreign companies or other entities that sent iran sensitive missile technology or expertise biden was one of the few senators to oppose the bipartisan 2007 kyl lieberman amendment labeling the iranian revolutionary guard a terrorist organization in a december 2007 debate biden said iran is not a nuclear threat to the united states of america on msnbcs hardball biden said he never believed iran had a weapon system under production
8803959 now this issue appears to have been temporarily resolved i confirm the utilities will continue to operate and provide services to their customers past aug 31
8803960 how long the temporary rate increase will be sufficient for the utilities to be able to continue to operate depends on future fuel power and labor cost increases
8803961 the temporary rate increases will allow molokai properties to continue to provide water service until another entity can take over the operation
8803962 we recognize that this is a difficult situation for everyone involved and we especially understand residents concerns regarding increases in water rates however facing the potential shutdown of water and wastewater services the public utilities commission has taken appropriate action to ensure the health and safety of residents are not compromised by any disruption of water or wastewater service
8803963 we are extremely pleased with the record results of the 2008 fourth quarter and fiscal year
8803964 as we now enter fiscal year 2009 we believe we have the right people infrastructure and products in place which will allow us to continue to grow our company and expand our customer base

8803966 hurricane katrina was the costliest and one of the five deadliest hurricanes in the history of the united states
8803967 it formed over the bahamas on august 23 2005 and crossed southern florida as a moderate category 1 hurricane causing some deaths and flooding there before strengthening rapidly in the gulf of mexico and becoming one of the strongest hurricanes on record while at sea the storm weakened before making its second and third landfalls as a category 3 storm on the morning of august 29 in southeast louisiana and at the louisiana mississippi state line respectively
8803968 okay let me tell you what my concerns are number one you know the mayor has ordered the superdome to be used as a shelter of first resort i didnt hear about any other shelters as you may or may not know the superdome is about 12 feet below sea level so i dont know what the heck
8803969 im concerned about the roof i dont know whether the roof was designed to withstand a cat 5 hurricane
8803970 i do believe that i also heard there was no mandatory evacuations
8803971 taking prisoners out of prison they are leaving hotels open in downtown new orleans im very concerned about that
8803972 my gut tells me i told you guys my gut was that this is a bad one and big one i still feel that way today
8803973 look you cant do that because we in the field know what we need and what the priorities are snow all right brown and those priorities are established by the state and locals theyre not established by you

8803986 more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8803987 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and by the way john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8803988 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that sen mccain took office
8803989 lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced

8803992 if you have health care my plan will lower your premiums
8803993 if you dont youll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most
8803994 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
8803995 but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy

8804083 it was amazing when we went back to look at star trek no one had ever done the story about how the original crew came together
8804084 theres five thousand hours of star trek and no one ever covered how they all met so in a way that was liberating in that no one had stated how that happened exactly
8804085 and because we had been fans truly who knew all those years sitting in front of the tv watching transformers and star trek that we werent wasting our time
8804086 at first we were scared not because we didnt think it was worthy it was we didnt think we were worthy of it

8804132 the delegates come from all over the country jackie and i come from different places we started off supporting different people and i think the convention has really brought us together unified moving forward to bring the change we need in this country
8804133 i think at the beginning you said to me jackie has it really sunk in yet
8804134 at first i was in doubt i really was it was scary it was tense
8804135 its over and reality has set in its real its a done deal everybody has to move on and take that white house back
8804136 when the field gets big superstars really rise to the occasion and barack obamas a superstar
8804137 the biggest problem today is people clamoring for more credentials trying to get in there are lines up trying to get in to see these things
8804138 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8804139 making the ark the only connection between us and the pre flood world
8804140 forty fiveyears ago today my father delivered his i have a dream speech
8804141 we witness in part what has become of hisdream the acceptance by barack obama of the presidential democraticnomination
8804142 decided not by the color of hisskin but by the content of his character
8804143 im sure mymother and father are smiling down are looking down smiling
8804144 itis amazing ive got my daughter with me just to witness this
8804145 my childrens children and their childrenwill be talking and studying about this moment
8804146 this is just such a huge piece of american history
8804147 there were so many people who didnt thinktheyd live to see the day
8804148 and to see it materialize in some small way through this process i think moves the nation no matter who youre supporting
8804149 i dont know if i ever really thought id see this
8804150 when you look at the republican party youre looking at america from leave it to beaver and
8804151 also let me add from jim crow white and colored water fountains andwater cannons and dogs set upon young black children
8804152 onegeneration ago my mom was looking at whites only signs
8804153 now were looking at the highest office in the land that couldpossibly held by an african american
8804154 i never thought somebody who looks like me who shares my values would be nominated to be president
8804155 democrats dont deserve to win just because republicans deserve to lose
8804156 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8804157 cannot be bullied into accepting a contract that is less than fair
8804158 its a safety factor and our paramount issue is the safety of our students
8804159 nobody dreamed it was going to jump to this level we are very thankful it has leveled off for now and not increased
8804160 it seems having a piece of paper is more valuable than having desirable skills or useful knowledge
8804161 theyre here already brian all these bushies with their suvs and their obama with mickey mouse ears t shirts its creepy
8804162 ugh its like turning on the kitchen light and seeing cockroaches all over
8804163 i have to work not that it will be easy getting there with these worms crawling around the streets theyre all
8804164 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8804165 is now openly endorsing thepolicies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actuallycontinue them
8804166 if you like the bush cheney approach johnmccains your man
8804167 i believe this election is close todaymainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid ofthe change barack obama represents
8804168 by the fact that while claiming to be an observant jew he has been misrepresenting and falsifying to the american people the teachings of the torah against partial birth infanticide against special privileges and preferential treatment for flaunting homosexuals and against religious intermarriage of jews
8804169 violated our sacred torah by his senate votes upholding partial birth infanticide and legitimizing homosexuality which abnormal and unhealthy behavior the torah strongly condemns as sinful and immoral
8804170 we excommunicated him to show that serious orthodox jews consider what lieberman was doing a betrayal of the most basic values of our holy torah that excommunication even though not widely acknowledged is still one hundred percent spiritually valid
8804171 serious religious jews who understand that the most important issues facing our country are the moral issues and know senator liebermans long and sad record of embracing partial birth abortion and the homosexual agenda realize that hes the wrong choice for vice president or for any high position in a mccain administration
8804172 we call upon christian pro family leaders such as gary bauer james dobson don wildmon tony perkins et al to raze mccain at the republican convention he said
8804173 to revolt and say that lieberman should he be appointed is unacceptable it is only by respecting the pro family values of americans that mccain deserves to be president if he should betray us i dont think it bodes well for his political future or the future of the country
8804174 its really very simple its not going well for white working class or any working class people in this country or for middle class people
8804175 the policies that have been in place have produced results that have them running in place
8804176 in almost every way sen mccain is offering to do almost exactly what weve the bush administration done for the last eight years
8804177 as they say you brung me up scranton never leaves you pennsylvania never leaves you
8804178 bureaucracy is the structure and set of regulations in place to control activity usually in large organizations and government as opposed to adhocracy it is represented by standardized procedure rule following that dictates the execution of most or all processes within the body formal division of powers hierarchy and relationships in practice the interpretation and execution of policy can lead to informal influence
8804179 sir these steak bites are killing your product cost and costing you money

8804188 the peoples temple is one of the most provocative and fascinating pieces of theatre i have ever been involved with that six years of interviews and research has gone into the project is simply astounding
8804189 when i arrived over six months ago i knew immediately that atc needed to bring this groundbreaking piece to chicago we are so proud to bring life to the people and stories that had been lost to america until leigh and her brave collaborators so painstakingly assembled them together in this incredible theatrical journey the peoples temple debunks the myths of jonestown and tells the truth straight from the people who lived it
8804190 twenty five years ago we have witnessed ninoy pay the steep price of true love of country as we gather together to understand the plight of our people in our next kwentong bayan may we be emboldened again to take whatever means of heroism that we can commit ourselves to do
8804191 let us hear anew the story of our country told by three important speakers and well respected experts on the economic social and political situation of our country
8804192 a resumption of the war in mindanao and sulu as radical elements in the moro islamic liberation front and the abu sayyaf raise the ante by making demands on the manila government that they know the manila government cannot accede to
8804193 president arroyo would respond positively to a call for martial law whether the causes are real or manufactured
8804194 but there would also be the possibility of a military takeover on or before 2010 precisely to prevent president arroyo from staying in power beyond 2010
8804195 in both scenarios martial law by president arroyo or military takeover on or before 2010 congress would be abolished civil and political rights would be suspended and there would be no presidential elections in 2010
8804196 but president arroyo would continue her maneuvers to remain in power beyond 2010 either as prime minister if we switch to the parliamentary system or as president without term limits if we retain the presidential system
8804197 so even under my best case scenario i do not think there will be presidential elections in 2010

8804210 unlike solar and wind we can run this plant night or day summer or winter
8804211 the best part of the u s for growing trees
8804212 probably its because im canadian and we have this sense of privacy you feel like youre invading someones space and for what their job is to act on television or whatever and so i recognize them from that but what gives me the right or entitlement to go over and interrupt their day
8804213 my big thing is always well if you ask someone for an autograph that will ruin your chances of ever being friends with them right forever youre a fan
8804214 but i have to say my cast mates here in los angeles have been so supportive they all have been pushing me to the middle theyre so awesome and i dont think of myself as the lead at all
8804215 some of my former cast mates back home werent that interested in talking about it with me
8804216 getting on an american show let alone what could be the next big hit you cant fathom it as a kid in toronto it seems impossible to break the ice and get into the industry in l a so for someone else to do it it has to tug at the heart strings when you also want it so badly
8804217 i always am the first one to call whoever gets a new role with genuine support because you are you and i am me and your career is yours and mine is mine if youre meant for it im not and vice versa i dont believe in the competition thing at all so i let it all fly right back
8804218 but a lot of them were very supportive jamie johnston who plays peter stone on degrassi has been calling me all the time i miss them
8804219 ive never been to an acting class but ive been through enough in my life that there are enough emotions and feelings and situations to pull from and i have the ability to do that and thats all acting is being a really good liar
8804220 just do it as if it were the truth you know what i mean
8804221 if you overthink it you overact and its just lame

8804227 i remember the first time i went to the mall after the show came out everywhere i went people were coming up to me and asking for pictures it was total insanity

8804229 the numbers are just going crazy every week its the highest rated show abc family has ever had
8804230 after the pilot we had 4 6 million viewers and it keeps going up every week its crazy
8804231 she struggles with being upset with him and trying to forgive him
8804232 there are so many different characters that there is someone that everyone can relate to
8804233 ive just been really lucky with the opportunities that have come along i really try to work hard to push myself

8804235 im so lucky to be in the position now to be a little bit more selective im looking at a lot of scripts for films starting next year
8804236 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8804237 but were very thankful it concluded the way it did
8804238 love is not about possession it never was till today she still remains in my heart my only regret was that i was not around to help her to give her support i know i could change it she could have been alive today to all people out there though saying words to your love ones may be hard do not hide your feelings express it in other ways
8804239 for all you out there with someone special in your heart cherish that person cherish every moment that you spend together that special someone for in life anything can happen anytime you may painfully regret only to realise that it is too late
8804240 state universities and colleges like up should be catering to the financially underprivileged during these difficult times but now that up has tuition that is comparable to private universities with p1 000 per unit as base bracket the countrys premiere state university has conclusively negated its orientation as a university for the underprivileged but deserving students
8804241 the beneficiaries of the philhealth sponsore d program will enjoy the same benefits enjoyed by all regular philhealth members
8804242 the president is determined to ensure better social protection services for the poor which is why the government is aggressively pushing for the maintenance and expansion of this program
8804243 a militarized peace process that serves its counter insurgency and pacification campaign and mrs arroyos agenda to remain in power
8804244 arroyo and her generals are conducting the peace negotiations with the milf and the national democratic front ndf within the militarist framework of counter insurgency strategy oplan bantay laya
8804245 in fact the un special rapporteur philip alston has recommended the removal of ejk from the counter insurgency program
8804246 esperon has yet to cast off his militarist mindset of pacification and has yet to be made accountable for the extra judicial killings of a thousand activists
8804247 it appears that arroyo and the afp just went through the motion of prolonging negotiations and accommodating certain demands of the milf only to keep them from resuming its armed offensives but the regime does not seem to have made serious efforts to ensure that the evolving agreements are accepted by her allies the affected communities and the public
8804248 we vehemently condemn the killing of wawie dutarot and directly hold the macapagal arroyo government responsible for this latest atrocity attributed to troops and militias under her control as commander in chief of the armed forces of the philippines
8804249 the afps continued implementation of obl bodes ill for activists and poses more grave abuses of human rights
8804250 fifteen to 17 years old is not exactly the best age in life to be entrusted with power and authority
8804251 this age bracket is comprised of teenagers who are only beginning to learn what responsibility means
8804252 and should set aside their political activities for a while
8804253 disempower the people particularly the youth at the local level and contradict the essence of the devolution of the government
8804254 deepening democracy in the way we organize our politics entails having accessible local government units in this case the countrys youth having direct and meaningful participation in the affairs of government must be one of the solutions to its problems
8804255 potentially biggest pork barrel to aid the ruling parties in the coming 2010 elections
8804256 this proposed measure is basically the biggest pork barrel of them all since the bill mandates state funding for the travel expenses of candidates and their staff outreach programs recruitment drives campaigns et cetera this is definitely part of the preparations of the ruling majority parties for the coming 2010 presidential elections
8804257 hb 3655 specifies in chapter iii establishes a state subsidy fund which actually mandates taxpayers to shoulder the expenses and operations of accredited political parties this is worse than the traditional pork barrel which has to be released on the pretext of priority projects for constituents this time the funds in this proposed law will go directly to the pockets of politicians who lord over the major political parties and this time it will not be the executive but the politicians themselves who will decide the amounts to be appropriated in the general appropriations act every year
8804258 its time we had a president committed to shutting down guantanamo and ending torture
8804259 it is not always money i endorsed because i have been wearing levis since my childhood and it is a product which is recognised since ages

8804263 no habr personajes exclusivos para cada consola en street fighter iv
8804264 el pr ximo reto de los ol mpicos es dar el salto de calidad para estar a la altura de los mejores pa ses del mundo podemos porque tenemos talento y capacidad y tenemos el ejemplo vosotros
8804265 nosotros vamos a hacer lo que m s nos gusta y vamos a disfrutar y si es posible ganar alguna medalla
8804266 todos los corredores tendr n su pasaporte biol gico en regla y adem s el laboratorio de madrid ya tiene la tecnolog a necesaria para detectar la cera
8804267 dentro del vestuario hay tranquilidad y el equipo est ya centrado en el inicio de campeonato
8804268 esta historia no creo que afecte ni al equipo ni a l espero que una vez que ya ha pasado y que ya se queda aqu sea algo que no afecte al grupo y en su caso se le ve muy tranquilo y muy normal y ya ha vivido muchas cosas en esto del f tbol
8804269 todos saben que estas cosas siempre suelen pasar a estas alturas y no tiene porque afectarnos a santi lo veo bien y tranquilo y sab amos que pasara lo que pasara el no tendr a problemas para nosotros es un jugador muy importante y clave para este equipo por lo que su marcha hubiera sido un palo muy duro
8804270 creo que estas cosas incluso motivan m s que afectan
8804271 que un club como el real madrid se interese por ti es una inyecci n de moral importante para un jugador y para nosotros que se quede tambi n lo es ya que sabemos que es un gran jugador un futbolista que nos aporta muchas cosas
8804272 la verdad es que me ha sorprendido y me gustan los nuevos fichajes del pamesa porque creo que los nuevos jugadores nos van a ayudar bastante
8804273 ni las ca das ni los neum ticos han mermado mi confianza
8804274 un pilotaje mejor con m s confianza y mayor rendimiento
8804275 si no fuese por los problemas con las gomas quiz tendr a el cuarto puesto un poco m s asegurado pero tambi n hubo ca das y malos resultados as que pensar en la tercera plaza tambi n se antoja complicado
8804276 una pista menos cr tica que laguna seca y brno as que en principio deber amos estar m s cerca de los bridgestone
8804277 las pruebas en brno fueron bien para m y para mi pilotaje y para michelin porque probamos nuevas gomas que mejoraron el rendimiento si esos neum ticos nuevos van a funcionar aqu eso ya es otra historia
8804278 no es f cil cuando se tiene una pretemporada como la que nosotros hemos tenido en la que a veces te faltan diez hombres por razones diferentes bien por compromisos internacionales o por los juegos ol mpicos
8804279 entonces regresan dos o tres jugadores una semana la siguiente vienen m s
8804280 seguiremos mejorando y estaremos totalmente preparados como equipo cuando comiencen las fases de grupo ya que hasta ahora nos hemos ido preparando para cada partido sin contar con cuatro o cinco jugadores en cada encuentro
8804281 en el mejor momento en el que puede llegar ahora
8804282 la gente est animada y con ganas y seguro que opciones de victoria vamos a tener
8804283 es el coco de la categor a como el madrid o el barcelona en primera divisi n tiene jugadores muy importantes en su plantilla con las fichas de uno o dos de estos jugadores hacemos nuestro presupuesto
8804284 su objetivo es ascender pero en este primer partido si hacemos las cosas bien tendremos opciones de ganar
8804285 nuestra actual plantilla es de diecinueve hombres con los tres porteros incluidos est claro que tienen que venir tres o cuatro jugadores m s para esta jornada la convocatoria es evidente estar n todos menos uno de los guardametas
8804286 es un grupo dificil simo porque est el mejor equipo del mundo
8804287 pero no por mis palabras sino porque es lo que corresponde despu s de que todos los pilotos de michelin estuvi semos tan mal en brno
8804288 dije lo que sent a no miento ni me invento las cosas pero m s all de eso ellos deber an moverse para mejorar el rendimiento no porque yo me haya quejado
8804289 en 125 y 250 ser a m s f cil en motogp tengo m s dudas no todas las motos son iguales
8804290 pero ahora lo m s importante es estar a la altura no siento nostalgia del inicio del campeonato porque las cosas pasan y ya est y tampoco se puede decir que lo haya echado todo a perder
8804291 una cosa menos de la que preocuparse mejor para ahorrar energ as
8804292 no hay que descartar que nuestra intenci n es ganar el partido
8804293 no es un punto y seguido respecto del a o pasado porque la plantilla est muy renovada y es un principio de un proyecto que esperemos d buenos resultados
8804294 han sido dif ciles para el mallorca exceptuando el a o pasado
8804295 es un equipo con un esquema de muchos a os atr s
8804296 cuando vi c mo el lazio lo celebraba al final del partido era como si hubieran ganado la copa del mundo yo no estaba nada contento y pens esto no me volver a pasar
8804297 para nosotros es un partido muy importante y todos somos conscientes de ello
8804298 el placer de disfrutar cada d a de la adrenalina que supone correr en moto
8804299 banega no pudo estar muy bien en el valencia y ojal que ac est muy bien
8804300 uno ya conoce este club pero hablando con el kun siempre me habl muy bien del atl tico
8804301 me dieron la oportunidad de estar en otro club espa ol y ahora a tratar de pensar en lo que es el atleti adem s ahora que juega la champions lleg con m s ilusi n todav a
8804302 vengo a sumar a ser uno m s del equipo y a tratar de hacer las cosas bien para que no solamente yo sino todos los compa eros saquemos adelante el equipo
8804303 en valencia me dieron la oportunidad de jugar cuando me toc jugar lo hice y ahora estoy pensando en el atleti intentar jugar ac y poner la cabeza en esto
8804304 mis representantes me comentaron que el equipo estuvo muy bien es un buen momento para el club y en lo personal tambi n entrar en liga de campeones es importante as que hay buena competici n
8804305 para nosotros estar en el sorteo ya era una ilusi n muy grande tenemos que disfrutar de esta competici n y estamos contentos aunque el manchester united va a ser un rival dur simo
8804306 es igual de peligroso relajarse que pensar que no puedes ganar al manchester
8804307 adem s el madrigal ser un campo peligroso tanto para el manchester como para celtic o aalborg los otros dos rivales del grupo
8804308 ser importante c mo se suba el cordal porque aunque s lo tiene 5 kil metros tiene rampas muy duras y probablemente los que se corten ah no tengan tiempo de enlazar
8804309 el angliru me ha parecido dur simo cuando empiezas te crees que ya has pasado lo m s duro pero te das cuenta de que no cuando llegas a la cue a les cabres y su 23 de desnivel ese tramo y luego otro ya cerca del final de 21 es lo peor
8804310 a partir de ah el resto de rivales nos van a pelear por entrar como segundos
8804311 es muy peligroso pensar que somos favoritos para ser segundos si pensamos as quedaremos eliminados tenemos que respetar a todos los rivales s lo as tendremos opciones de pasar
8804312 ya tiene due o y habr que pelear por la que queda
8804313 es el reencuentro con el ni o fernando torres porque ha jugado ac y lo conocemos todos es un rival muy dif cil como los dem s y hay que estar tranquilos porque todos los equipos de la champions son dif ciles
8804314 el grupo no es nada f cil pero haremos todo lo posible para pasar el liverpool es un equipo muy muy grande hay que jugar el partido y hay que ganarlo como sea no va a estar nada f cil
8804315 el duelo es el liverpool atl tico no torres kun somos once contra once
8804316 ellos tienen adem s de torres muy buenos jugadores igual que ac estamos muy bien y ojal que podamos sacar un buen resultado ustedes los medios de comunicaci n siempre van a decir que es torres kun pero es el liverpool atl tico para m todo el mundo va a estar diciendo esos dos nombres
8804317 estoy esperando el momento de que empiece ya la champions hacer un buen partido que el equipo est bien y que podamos clasificarnos
8804318 kun me habl muy bien del club y vengo a darlo todo por l
8804319 lo conozco muy bien y es un gran jugador no pudo estar muy bien en el valencia y ojal que ac est muy bien nosotros lo vamos a ayudar con los argentinos que le conocemos para que l pueda triunfar aqu en el atl tico
8804320 el partido de la previa de la liga de campeones era muy importante hay buenos futbolistas y este a o se podr conseguir algo con los jugadores que hay hay que confiar en nosotros que somos un gran equipo y seguro que se va a conseguir algo algo es un t tulo cualquiera me gustar a
8804321 la afici n del atl tico y nosotros mismos necesitamos tener algo y vamos a hacer todo por conseguirlo ojal que podamos llegar lo m s lejos posible en la champions y en la copa y si se puede ganar mejor todav a
8804322 para m fueron dos finales en los juegos ol mpicos y sta estaba muy contento con la medalla y sab a que en tres d as ten a un partido muy jodido y que si no gan bamos la medalla no la iba a recordar e iba a estar pensando que lamentablemente nos hab amos quedado fuera y gan las dos finales
8804323 se jug bien pero no yo sino todos corrimos todos salimos muy bien y se gan as que estamos todos muy contentos y hay que seguir para adelante anduvimos muy bien y supimos manejar a un equipo muy fuerte como el schalke que ya ten a experiencia de liga de campeones
8804324 y se gan muy f cil porque no pensamos que nos iba a resultar tan f cil anduvimos todos muy bien y por eso se hizo m s f cil
8804325 estaba muy contento y baj al vestuario a felicitarme yo tambi n estoy muy feliz
8804326 estoy muy agradecido por la gente que est cada segundo gritando mi nombre y no s lo conmigo sino que tambi n aplaudieron a todos y eso le da m s confianza a los dem s jugadores yo estoy muy contento con el club con la gente y espero que la gente le d todo el cari o tambi n a los dem s jugadores
8804327 arranqu muy bien contento por la medalla y este partido tambi n fue como una medalla m s ojal que este a o siga de la misma manera
8804328 los grandes equipos todo el mundo sabe quienes son y como juegan pero que hay otros que la gente los conoce menos
8804329 tomarse estos partidos seriamente para poder estar lo m s arriba posible y si es posible llegar como m nimo a octavos o cuartos
8804330 i just want you to do one thing for me on every take i just want you to be great

8804332 if that were our intent we would not be working as feverishly as we are weve been going down a lot of avenues to emerge from bankruptcy
8804333 they had a strong quarter which was widely expected but the outlook was light

8804335 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose our sense of higher purpose and thats what we have to restore
8804336 tengo esa espina clavada llegu al valencia en un gran momento de forma con t tulos bajo el brazo era internacional con brasil hab a sido campe n del mundo y pens que podr a aportar muchas cosas a este equipo pero las lesiones provocan que la gente se olvide de todo eso y que se creen dudas
8804337 todo esto me duele porque yo s lo que puede hacer me siento muy bien y espero tener la posibilidad de jugar varios partidos seguidos ese es mi reto para esta temporada
8804338 me parece muy bien el esfuerzo que ha realizado el club con estos dos jugadores ya que como ellos hay pocos aportan muchas cosas goles y calidad y son los que marcan la diferencia
8804339 no soy yo quien ha de decidir sobre este tipo de cosas hay gente en el club que responder a mejor a esta pregunta
8804340 fue un palo duro pero hay que olvidar cuanto antes y empezar a vivir la liga
8804341 estamos motivados entrenamos con intensidad y creo que estamos en el buen camino

8804352 erstmals seit ende des zweiten weltkriegs versucht eine der gro en europ ischen m chte durch einseitige
8804353 the government we have and the mess we are in is a
8804354 leider mu man und wenn man sich noch so sehr
8804355 they didnt even have the proper tools for us to work with
8804356 just to let you know about my experience i built that room when it was the aloha showroom
8804357 i also built the magic of polynesia showroom we do the roofing we do the stage and we do lighting and sound ive set up trade shows and conventions when they were doing all this stuff they didnt have the correct people and they were under the gun because they were already a year behind schedule on getting this place open we were going in as stagehands to help set up the stage part and we ended up being laborers for the steelworkers union we hauled steel thats a job for people in construction not what we were hired for
8804358 theyre supposed to top coat that stuff before they bring it on the site
8804359 but we just pulled it straight out of the containers and put it straight in the room one of the guys actually had to go to the hospital and get surgery done to his hand he almost lost his hand because of it one of the girls that was on my crew her infection got really bad and reacted with her body on some other stuff that she was sick for about 10 days she couldnt do anything
8804360 they started telling a bunch of lies about the staff members drinking and that sort of stuff
8804361 the roof is rated for everything that goes up there the floor thats there has never been rated thats one of those things that might come up to haunt them because after you put tension or stress on something thats not in the right place or hasnt had the right stuff done to it thats when it starts acting like it will break away
8804362 that building is absolutely structurally sound all of the engineering has been double checked every structural connection had to be reviewed literally every day
8804363 i can tell you with the likes of john allison we have nothing to be afraid of or concerned about
8804364 some of the things i saw were mainly the steelwork and the inadequate way of rushing to get things done i dont know what you would call it its just one of those things bush mechanics is what we call it were just stagehands but i can see if they dont correct the stuff up there and it runs for a little while all the stuff is just going to fade away
8804365 they have a 12 inch weld and then two feet of space and another 12 inch weld
8804366 what will happen is one of those welds will eventually give and it will act like a zipper and depending on how much weight theyre putting on these its one of those things where it will all just come down
8804367 thats the kind of reasoning that says one missing rivet would make an entire airplane fall apart
8804368 the real question is why would the weld fail you weld whats necessary the catwalks theres really no loading on it and a one inch weld can take somewhere around 2 500 pounds of capacity its there for security but its not there to do any work theres no tension but anybody can say anything thats just the way it is i dont know why they must be disgruntled maybe theyre just concerned but theres no real load on it
8804369 i walked away from it because i saw a lot of problems with safety with what they were doing when i told them that they had to bring some people in to have them look at this then they got pissed off at me and basically told me not to come back
8804370 do you think you should really be able to feel that
8804371 they wanted me to stay on so i can fix things when they break
8804372 those seating sections are 4 000 pounds a piece and there are four sections whats happening is the weight from the sections makes the concrete bubble because of the tension theyre simply painting over it when it happens
8804373 we replaced it to expedite the lowering and raising of the seats
8804374 it left pock marks in the floor and we didnt try to patch everything up unless it was necessary
8804375 but if they dont fix it there is going to be some problems
8804376 its really a ridiculous statement nothing is perfect in this world you buy a car it may have a little chip in it but thats an insignificant thing what i can tell you is that this design is 100 percent sure
8804377 but if i dont say something and somebody dies im ruined as well
8804378 they are frightening to us because we cant trace back their origins
8804379 my house is worth 80 000 i wouldnt give sic anyone 80 000 for my house

8804440 lo importante no es saber si no tener el tel fono del que sabe
8804441 me atengo a la respuesta del licenciado en econom a que me
8804442 de costo de siembra cosecha fumigaci n etc 30 del bruto producido
8804443 en todo caso incentiven la producci n al interior del pa s podr an poner un cupo interno y exportar todo el resto y sin retenciones
8804444 si usted viene a la argentina a hacer negocios no gane demasiado porque lo vamos a tratar de usurero
8804445 las retenciones a la soja que de paso aclaro son mucho mas altas que al maiz o al trigo son parte de esa incentivaci n a producir mas de lo que se consume aqui porque el problema es que cuando todo el mundo plante soja vamos a tener que ir a comprar el maiz o el trigo afuera y ahi vamos a tener que pagar precios internacionales
8804446 plan de incentivos a la producci n de maiz y trigo
8804447 hay que suspender las retenciones durante 90 d as para que no sea un elemento urticante que molesta
8804448 estoy dispuesto a prestarle el campo tal cual est hoy con todo lo sembrado m quinas y por el plazo de 1 a o y a cambio yo me quedo con todo lo debe pagar ese campo en concepto de impuestos iva igcias retenciones ing brutos
8804449 el otro punto es sobre la constituconalidad del aumento a las retenciones ac aclaro que los abogados saben mucho mejor del tema que yo qui n tan solo s del tema por haber liquidado impuestos todas las leyes impositivas iva ganancias aduaneras etc han sido avaladas por el congreso y en todos los casos se le d al poder ejecutivo la facultad de reglamnetarla y fijar su nivel de al cuota hasta donde yo s es igual para las retenciones
8804450 la soluci n no es apretar al productor sino subsidiar a aquellos que no pueden pagar los alimentos
8804451 me parece m s l gico dejar que de los ricos se ocupe el mercado y a los pobres subsidiarlos se me ocurre que esto puede implementarse a trav s de la entrega a estos ltimos de vales para compras de d nde salen los fondos de las ganancias que el campo obtendr el mercado
8804452 aumentar el impuesto a las ganancias en lugar de las retenciones no tiene ning n beneficio para el mercado interno ya que no lo diferencia del externo y no cumple con el c rculo virtuoso industrializador que comentaba
8804453 hacemos piquetes para que a uds no les pase lo que nos paso a nosotros
8804454 dejo en claro que mi posici n sobre este tema ha sido influenciada por el discurso antip tico y poco conciliador de nuestra presidencia as como tambi n su forma antip tica y prepotente de comunicar algo que en realidad no est tan mal

8804473 we can say this were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado

8804491 i am surrounded by friends and family and feel safe and secure
8804492 we can say this were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8804493 instead of looking for a particular kind of structure we came up with a broader algorithm that is able to look for all of these structures and weigh them against each other

8804617 a majority of staff in the dvla unlike dft staff as a whole are based in wales where economic conditions are already worse than other areas of the uk and the lower pay rates are costing the welsh economy 13 million every year
8804618 there is a difference between dvla and department for transport salaries at some grades but it is dvlas policy to align its pay rates to the local market in which it competes for staff
8804619 maintaining a service to customers is a priority and the agency will ensure disruption to customer service is minimised

8804629 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8804630 im getting on a bit while ive seen people tasered im probably reluctant to do it myself
8804631 if were prepared to use this on members of the public when we have to its only right and proper that the head of the organisation tries it out for himself

8804643 we anticipate that credit growth should begin to show signs of improvement in 2009 as interest rates are cut further from mid next year and conditions and sentiment begin to improve
8804644 i finally think i heard enough from mosby today to let me go ahead without calling for a supplemental eir

8804652 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
8804653 we think they will cut rates to mitigate the downside risks from that ms deda said
8804654 we dont think they may be as aggressive as past easing cycles
8804655 by the middle of next year it will be clear that inflation is heading down and the reserve bank will have cut interest rates by over 100 basis points mr oughton said
8804656 more rooms and 100 fewer parking places than our plan

8804674 the boys who are allowed to go help at the event are those who have earned it
8804675 the rotarians are always so grateful and full of praise for the boys making good decisions
8804676 its a unique fireworks event in that it is funded entirely by the community enjoyed by the community and all proceeds go circularly back into the community

8804732 it is he who comes after me the thong of whose sandal i am not worthy to untie 28these things took place in bethany beyond the jordan where john was baptizing
8804733 you say that prayer is a priority show me your daytimer
8804734 by faith moses parents hid him for three months after he was born because they saw he was no ordinary child and they were not afraid of the kings edict
8804735 blessed is the nation whose god is lord and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance
8804736 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it
8804737 righteousness exalteth a nation but sin is a reproach to any people
8804738 from the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another
8804739 the spirit of the lord is upon me for he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor he has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released that the blind will see that the oppressed will be set free and that the time of the lords favor has come
8804740 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
8804741 oh this is what christianity is all about very cool
8804742 a major new research project unveiled for the first time in this book describes the increasingly negative reputation of christians especially among young americans the research shows that christians are best known for what they are against they are perceived as being judgmental anti homosexual and too political and young people are quick to point out they believe that christianity is no longer as jesus intended christianity is un christian
8804743 you yourselves are our letter known and read by everybody
8804744 look how much they love one another i want some of that
8804745 honor one another above yourselves share with gods people who are in need live in harmony with one another do not be proud but be willing to associate with people of low position do not be conceited
8804746 i never knew because i never heard nor have seen god his moral demands and his wrath against sin are clearly evident in the world around us
8804747 that those who knew god but have turned away to other things will eventually become possessed by earthly matter and sensual desires the text says that god gave them over to their passions these people will be worthy of death
8804748 love god with all your heart and soul and mind and strength love your neighbor as yourself
8804749 i have loved you with an everlasting love and with unfailing love i have drawn you to myself
8804750 but he who takes refuge in me will inherit the land and will possess my holy mountain
8804751 build up build up prepare the way remove every obstacle out of the way of my people
8804752 if you do not forgive neither will your father forgive your trespasses
8804753 father i forgive them as youve forgiven me whatever i ask for myself in blessing i ask for them in double measure
8804754 im excited to be heading to australia theres a lot of buzz about the new championship and the new formats it is introducing to the sport
8804755 it will be great to race alongside chad the spotlight is on him after his recent win and this can only be good for other australian riders as their talent is placed on a world stage
8804756 i am so excited that jeremy mcgrath is going to come down to australia and race in two rounds of super x
8804757 he is a true legend of the sport and was my hero when i was coming through the ranks this is an opportunity of a lifetime for australian sporting fans to see jeremy myself and defending australian champion dan reardon all going head to head
8804758 from the outset weve promised the world a groundbreaking new supercross series and the confirmation of jeremy mcgrath is a major coup
8804759 jeremy transformed the sport and much of the following it enjoys today is due to his dominance and the incredible breed of sportsmanship he brought to supercross
8804760 when you talk about andrew symonds its like talking about bradman as a batsman or ponting as a batsman
8804761 hes in a place of his own hes that good an athlete in many ways like usain bolt
8804762 i think hes the best all around athlete for strength power and speed in cricket ive seen
8804763 ricky ponting is real good michael clarke is real good but none of those guys have the flat out brute athletic power and strength of symonds
8804764 its happened to us before and weve lost not just to bangladesh but to a lot of teams
8804765 as soon as you take things for granted i think you find yourself asking questions why youve lost that game so its important we concentrate on saturday
8804766 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8804767 the internet has provided immeasurable benefits to us all however like many good things there are deviants who want to misuse the internet and social networking sites to harm others
8804768 it is our job to do whatever we can to deter destructive behavior and the potentially tragic consequences that harm our children the legislation i signed protecting missourians from cyber stalking is a big step in the right direction
8804769 missourians do not condone lawbreaking nor do we look away when someone tries to take advantage of others we enforce our laws we defend law abiding citizens we reserve the benefits of citizenship for legal residents
8804770 the legislation i signed embraces the contributions that lawful immigration makes to our society and sends a clear message that we will defend the rule of law and fight to protect missourians from illegal immigration
8804771 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8804772 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8804773 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8804774 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8804775 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8804776 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8804777 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8804778 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care what goes on in the lives of americas i just think he doesnt known
8804779 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8804780 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8804781 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8804782 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8804783 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8804784 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8804785 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8804786 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8804787 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8804788 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8804789 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power
8804790 i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8804791 using campaign staff as mules for laundering money should be an immediate disqualification to be the next attorney general
8804792 missourians should be concerned that the democrat nominee for attorney general is still under investigation by the missouri ethics commission for illegally receiving donations that are larger than missouri law allows the people of missouri want a candidate for attorney general who protects the law not breaks it
8804793 im the only politician in missouri in america i think quite frankly whos had the opportunity already to retire a republican governor a republican treasurer who will be replaced by this fine young man clint zweifel
8804794 and i just got one more i get to retire a republican george bush john mccain voting congressman kenny hulshof
8804795 the gates of hell john mccain wont even follow him to the cave where he is hiding
8804796 rogy and i are pretty tight and he called me a couple of years ago when i went to singapore on a three year deal and then last year when there was trouble there and we thought we were going to fall over he called me again
8804797 i really couldnt do much if they went ahead but if they didnt i was seriously considering coming to perth then
8804798 but singapore got it together so i stayed but this is the third time he tried to get me
8804799 over time it just made sense i feel im coming into a fantastic situation
8804800 its gonna be a good thing for guam if we can get that hospital built here
8804801 fred will always be fondly remembered for his humorous spirit and the laughter he brought into all our lives
8804802 hin is basically an import car show but it embodies the whole kind of youth culture
8804803 confirmado el cl sico se jugar el 14 de septiembre a las 17h00 en el capwell
8804804 dicha informaci n fue ratificada por los directivos del cuadro azul
8804805 its about action i can talk they can talk we can all talk
8804806 its not hard to do that but it doesnt make any difference
8804807 so its about actions and the challenge to the players is im confident they can do it and i hope theyre confident they can do it
8804808 the group has responded to probably every challenge that has been thrown at them over the past six years
8804809 we started off the season people said we couldnt make the eight weve done that again
8804810 so weve answered a few questions there are now some questions about us again and hopefully we can answer those questions also
8804811 its a challenge because we are obviously not playing well but ive still got enormous faith in this group and the team and the players that we can turn it around
8804812 can we win next week we absolutely can next week if we play our best footy and get our guys into some form
8804813 and thats the challenge for all of us to get back into form
8804814 actually ryan is a bit crook so hes one who might not play
8804815 its just the flu going around he was a bit crook yesterday
8804816 we wont take any risks with him hes probably a 50 50 chance at this stage
8804817 biar kau tahu kal orang seperti kita tak punya apa apa kecuali semangat dan mimpi mimpi dan kita akan bertempur habis habisan demi mimpi mimpi itu tanpa mimpi orang seperti kita akan mati mungkin setelah tamat sma kita hanya akan mendulang timah atau menjadi kuli tapi di sini kal di sekolah ini kita tak akan pernah mendahului nasib kita
8804818 a continuaci n alrededor de las 13h00 en el sector del antiguo hospital militar junto a la bas lica de la catedral recibir un homenaje de la alcald a de quito encabezado por su titular paco moncayo
8804819 no vamos a cambiar la forma ofensiva de encarar el partido
8804820 de la misma manera que lo hicimos con brasil que tiene tambi n jugadores muy destacados de mitad de cancha para adelante trataremos de hacer con argentina
8804821 una de las potencias mundiales y tenemos muchas expectativas de hacer las cosas bien
8804822 este es un partido de f tbol para m no est en juego la nacionalidad ni nada que se parezca me toca dirigir la selecci n y tengo que esforzarme para sacar esto adelante
8804823 no hay partidos que uno pueda ganar antes de jugar nos ha pasado en el ltimo combo de partidos cuando le ganamos a brasil y pensamos que le bamos a ganar a bolivia
8804824 its a slow process moving to a new position youre going to hit a few bumps but im getting better
8804825 after the first quarter i had to tell myself to settle down
8804826 where has my hope come from as i lie in the depths of this prison
8804827 once a man wanted to smuggle some merchandise across the border
8804828 the only ones who had a good trip were the horses
8804829 some start to tremble as soon as elul begins because they realize that everything is at stake life health livelihood family and peace of mind others are less sensitive but they at least have the sense to feel some anxiety on rosh hashanah itself then there are those people who are as insensitive as the horses their minds are focused on one thing only the trough
8804830 we just dont know how were going to get there you just have to pull out your credit card and hope you can pay at the end of the day
8804831 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8804832 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8804833 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8804834 theyre still going through it every detail line by line
8804835 so even a small disruption of a week or two can cause a slippage in the delivery schedule
8804836 thanks to my friend whose work made a real dent in danger in the world
8804837 gratitude looks good on everyone here are some ideas for upping our acknowledgement where we need it most
8804838 i would like to give my free printable thank you cards to the world to spread the word of thanks
8804839 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
8804840 if it goes missing i dont know what happened to it
8804841 they never said it was for content they said they wanted it to be 280 words but when you read it they took out the meat of the message
8804842 a fat balding pasty faced white man whos a conservative lemming of drug addict lying criminal rush limbaugh
8804843 i love your blog you must be an outstanding person
8804844 extension 720 show with milt rosenberg at 312 591 7200 show airs from 9 00 p m to 11 00 p m tonight
8804845 made his mark literally from day one reaching across the aisle to pass legislation to secure the worlds deadliest weapons
8804846 but i was proudest i was proudest when i watched him spontaneously focus the attention of the nation on the shameful neglect of americas wounded warriors at walter reed army hospital
8804847 what hes done in the united states senate fighting to ensure that the men and women who serve this country are welcomed home not just with medals and parades but with good jobs and benefits and health care including mental health care
8804848 es wird eine lange phase der parallel bertragung geben au erdem m ssen hohe investitionen von allen beteiligten vorgenommen werden in deutschland empfangen noch immer mehr als 60 prozent der haushalte ihr fernsehsignal analog
8804849 von daher ist es f r uns wichtig dass wir uns fr hzeitig auf diese neue technologie einstellen wir tun das bereits seit jahren in dem wir international verwertbare produktionen in diesem standard produzieren
8804850 dieser testbetrieb wird dann bis zum beginn der olympischen winterspiele in vancouver im februar 2010 aufrechterhalten zu diesem zeitpunkt beginnt dann die regul re ausstrahlung
8804851 die ersten acht monate zeigen dass wir das erreichen k nnen
8804852 por momentos saqu bien y jugu bastante bien de manera que me voy conforme para el pr ximo partido
8804853 a medida que pasan las ruedas cada vez es m s dif cil as que hay que estar muy atento porque nadie quiere regalar nada
8804854 es distinto porque es otra superficie nosotros en polvo de ladrillo y en casa rendimos un poco m s es diferente pero siempre viene bien
8804855 m s duro de lo que me hab a imaginado
8804856 por suerte empec de menor a mayor puse la garra que estaba poniendo y pude ganar y pasar a la tercera rueda
8804857 el viene bien viene de hacer semifinal en un masters series de ganarle a federer roger viene con confianza
8804858 wir rechnen mit einer konsolidierung des vertriebsmarkts es werden nur wenige gro e namen brig bleiben
8804859 unserer meinung nach sind wir in einer sehr guten position in dieses gesch ft zu expandieren
8804860 als jugendlicher kann man sich nur schwer vorstellen dass die eltern noch sex haben im alter steckt aber viel kraft und vitalit t das wollten wir mit dem film zeigen
8804861 i then bumped into him shopping about five days ago and we shared a laugh and he told me about his plans for a holiday
8804862 he seemed terrific but that doesnt mean anything because people keep this stuff to themselves
8804863 he would have always fought such dark feelings but god knows what overwhelmed him on wednesday
8804864 he gave a very insightful performance about a person dealing with some very tough things
8804865 ongoing torture of the childs half sibling who ultimately died of his injuries
8804866 clearly traumatized at the simple mention of her mothers name
8804867 i had to know when the next paycheck was coming and they were getting fewer and farther between
8804868 the fall off would be expected as the market slows down
8804869 and since they often pay a two year fee the license numbers dont vary as quickly from year to year
8804870 i was in it when it was great in it when it was good and in it when it wasnt so good
8804871 its been very successful ive been in the top 10 since i got here in february
8804872 at the time i sensed that the dallas market was going to contract some and that this combined with the saturation of agents made it a good time to consider other options
8804873 saw an opportunity to put the experience and awareness of customer needs that i had acquired to move into a related field architecture
8804874 nothing in the data we were given in may and june by bny mellon indicated in any way that these additional six million individuals and businesses were involved
8804875 the magnetic pulses are equivalent to what you get during an mri the intensity of the magnetic field
8804876 the patients do feel a tingle in their scalp which is not at all unpleasant that is really our only side effect and it is not at all a problem it merely indicates to the patient that there has been a treatment
8804877 shows that tms is a safe and effective treatment for the 7 million americans who have migraine with aura
8804878 migraine is a mechanism that is built into the human brain we all possess it and it becomes active by an efficient build up of its triggers
8804879 but once those triggers rise above the threshold migraine becomes activated and symptoms occur
8804880 the degree of symptoms depends on how high above the threshold your triggers are
8804881 the bottom line from my perspective is that its best to prevent it rather than to walk around with some expensive hardware to zap yourself every time you get an aura
8804882 and naturally i had bleeding on the brain once where i was lucky to survive and they operated on i was in a coma for a while
8804883 insurance is hard to get because theres a lot of falls and theres not enough jockeys to insure
8804884 you know its a small array of jockeys around australia and thats all they can get
8804885 i mean lets face it its the only industry where you cant start work unless theres an ambulance sitting behind you
8804886 it sadly it does have a downside weve been quite staggered at the number jockeys who have suffered from depression and post traumatic stress as a result of the effects of significant falls and unfortunately deaths
8804887 as long as the price is not creating a negative the bad guys can use dirty virtual money because sales of goods and services orchestrated by a spam campaign will clear their funds
8804888 the ruling should be required reading for the executives of every web 2 0 business that relies on user generated content
8804889 its a shadow of itself there is a low chance of development if there is any development it will be slow to occur over the next two days
8804890 thats not to say that it might not fire up over night thats entirely possible and may be something to monitor
8804891 it doesnt mean that well get it but its something to watch
8804892 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8804893 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8804894 probably the main lesson we learned from katrina and rita is to take care of employees make sure they have a place to stay food generators and a place for their families
8804895 its likely that well see a 10 cents per gallon increase in gasoline in texas and louisiana prior to the storms arrival
8804896 i really wish we had gotten those dang electric hedge trimmers
8804897 beware how you take away hope from another human being
8804898 hope is a state of mind not of the world hope in this deep and powerful sense is not the same as joy that things are going well or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously heading for success but rather an ability to work for something because it is good
8804899 its my belief that history is a wheel inconstancy is my very essence says the wheel rise up on my spokes if you like but dont complain when youre cast back down into the depths good time pass away but then so do the bad mutability is our tragedy but its also our hope the worst of time like the best are always passing away
8804900 all the stars are gone but one morning breaks here comes the sun cross the sky now sinking fast show me something built to last
8804901 cuz they say two thousand zero zero party over oops out of time so tonight im gonna party like its 1999
8804902 im not expecting to grow flowers dessert but i can live and breath and see the sun in winter time
8804903 she lies and says shes in love with him cant find a better man she dreams in color she dreams in red cant find a better man cant find a better man
8804904 obana has made me see things in a new way
8804905 how can you sir an educated man respected by everyone demean yourself by associating with such losers
8804906 dont get mixed up with those guys theyre a protected species theyre always going to lie their way out of trouble and theyll go scot free and leave you to pay the price
8804907 mom i dont think that i am going to be able to be the best in the olympics when i am older
8804908 not when there are only 5 people in the race
8804909 on average caregivers only slept about six and a half hours a night and took almost 23 minutes to fall asleep
8804910 using the sleep diary data that subjects kept at the same time however depression was the primary determinant of poor sleep with depressed subjects reporting less time asleep and more wake time over the week
8804911 he told me that there was a lot of gossip around the city gym that mr rivkin and gordon were he used the term faggots
8804912 he had quite strong feelings for your daughter didnt he
8804913 its a period of my life thats indelibly etched on my mind and i will never forget
8804914 in the same way you are trying to minimise your daughters problems with depression as well arent you
8804915 you are even trying to minimise the fact that she tried to take her own life in 1992
8804916 what we want to find out is why was this person was in a stolen vehicle and why didnt he stop when he had ample opportunity
8804917 they will have the same marriage rights as other inmates they will be able to marry non inmates but barred from marrying other inmates in prison
8804918 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets
8804919 the law requires they treat people the same so thats a good principle to have in mind when they are drafting regulations
8804920 this is such a great way for tenants to spend time together as a community not to mention making their environment more visually appealing and giving them the chance to save some money on fruit and vegetables
8804921 it has taken a lot of work but its been worth it the garden looks great and we have 17 garden areas on the site we couldnt have done it without the input of a wide range of individuals and organisations
8804922 jobs like this are a really direct way of offenders demonstrating reparation for their offending and giving something back to the community its also a very practical way to help offenders learn new skills and work habits which can assist with future employment
8804923 i was slipping through the cracks of a stolen jewel i was tightrope walking in two ton shoes
8804924 and although team names include the dreamers the salmon the painkillers spectators will not be disappointed by the level of skill demonstrated by these aging football dinosaurs
8804925 while the pace might be a bit more leisurely therell definitely be no lack of skill and touch
8804926 historically it has been tough for all teams playing in adelaide in all the calculations i think most people will be expecting us to go there and not get anything it may sound trite but really weve got nothing to lose in this one
8804927 but theres a feeling that despite last weekends result a 4 2 loss to melbourne victory that we are playing better all the time thats not to gloss over what happened against melbourne the boys are disappointed about the mistakes and were very disappointed about where we sit at the moment
8804928 thats the simple reality of it wed set a goal of being on four points after the first two matches but were on one
8804929 if we can go to adelaide and get something out of this game then thatll be a nice bonus for us i think were a very good chance
8804930 there is an internal drive from the players to do really well and they dont walk away after losing 4 2 taking things lightly there have been some challenges everyone has had to face but the week has been good and theres been some real intensity around the club
8804931 manny has done an excellent job for us throughout the pre season and in the first two games but david was signed specifically as our first choice right back and now that hes where we want him to be in terms of fitness and preparation its time he got his chance
8804932 its a tough one for david adelaide away the challenge will be there and thats the level hes going to have to be at im looking forward to seeing his performance
8804933 weve shown our ability to secure and control possession for long periods
8804934 hindmarsh im sure will be a really nice playing surface and thatll suit us
8804935 weve got leo and leilei coming back into the team theyre arguably two of the best wide players in the league and if we can get enough of the ball and get the right people forward then i think we can cause adelaide some problems
8804936 in terms of an inspirational leader steve jobs is really the best ive ever met microsoft corp co chairman bill gates said in january 1998 when asked to name the ceos he most admired
8804937 hes got a belief in the excellence of products hes able to communicate that
8804938 all about jobs about doing something about nafta about doing something to stop shipping jobs overseas
8804939 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8804940 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8804941 more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet
8804942 more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8804943 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy
8804944 so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8804945 finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8804946 he raced at a time when racing was extremely dangerous and got through it all without a serious injury
8804947 he had an extraordinary mechanical sense he was very much in tune with the car
8804948 i as well as all employees of ferrari are extremely saddened by the news of the passing of phil hill a man and a champion who gave so much to ferrari
8804949 phil and i have always kept in touch throughout the years and i know i will miss his passion and love for ferrari very much
8804950 and he knew it off the top of his head he was extremely intelligent and well rounded he was an opera expert and very well read he was very sophisticated
8804951 phil was a very special guy and had a love for the automotive age
8804952 he was always a potential winner when he sat in a race car he was both a competitor and a close friend and a fellow i could look up to

8804960 okay would you mind telling me where jane doe sits
8804961 is there some celebrity magazine about the celebrities who work here that i forgot to subscribe to
8804962 that org chart must be in every issue of the magazine that im not getting that is specially designed for people who have nothing in their lives other than this job and their perceived positions on the hierarchies that exist in the lower echelons here from 8 to 5
8804963 karen did you want to find out what youre having because i just saw what youre having

8804965 the finding that metastatic disease can arise from untransformed mammary cells in the circulation refines our conception of cancer progression
8804966 learning more about the spread of cancer or metastasis is essential because its harder to treat the disease once it has spread
8804967 these are important but early results in mice it will be interesting to see whether this can one day help the outcome of people affected by cancer
8804968 to face the biggest forces shaping this century the emergence of russia china and india as great powers and the emergence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front in the war on terror
8804969 if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets
8804970 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8804971 the over prescription of antipsychotics is a serious breach of human rights these drugs should only be a last resort
8804972 the forthcoming national dementia strategy is a crucial opportunity to stop this dangerous over prescribing and we look forward to its launch in the autumn
8804973 this study should remind us all that antipsychotics are powerful drugs which can both be essential for some people while carrying other risks
8804974 this whole thing is the biggest fairy tale ive ever seen
8804975 i sit alone in my four cornered room staring at candles
8804976 as someone who has frequently been wowed by obama speeches i was not wowed he was more emotionally diffident
8804977 het is belangrijk dat ik deze wedstrijd snel heb kunnen afmaken zodat ik op tijd naar bed kan gaan
8804978 er zijn te weinig conclusies getrokken uit onze sterke lichting de service van richard krajicek en brenda schultz had verplichte kost moeten zijn voor trainers in nederland
8804979 op het centercourt stond ik onder de lampen tegenover john mcenroe en jimmy connors dat waren bijzondere ervaringen
8804980 het is pijnlijk om te constateren dat dit nu weer het geval is al had robin haase zonder die blessure hier natuurlijk gewoon gestaan het is door een complexe samenloop van omstandigheden zover gekomen maar het wordt tijd om met alle betrokkenen om de tafel te gaan zitten deze zomer organiseerde rohan goetzke al een eerste bijeenkomst in rosmalen tussen de coaches van de knltb en enkele spelers die in de top honderd hebben gestaan dat was een positieve ontmoeting misschien is dit dieptepunt wel een goede aanleiding voor een symposium over toptennis
8804981 er wordt tegenwoordig te weinig op straat gespeeld want daar ontwikkel je dit soort kwaliteiten daarom is het goed dat er nu steeds meer van die cruijff en krajicek velden komen
8804982 dit is een zeer zeer teleurstellende nederlaag maar die heb ik te accepteren
8804983 ik maakte te veel onnodige fouten en mijn service liep ook niet lekker dit is erg frustrerend want ik weet dat ik zoveel beter kan
8804984 ik voelde er vandaag niets van net als in mijn vorige partij deze nederlaag laat zien dat ik harder moet werken en trainen om me te verbeteren
8804985 the cooperation between the relevant oil companies from china and iraq is mutually beneficial
8804986 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq and will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8804987 with oil prices surging the global contest for oil resources is becoming ever fiercer many governments have realised this and have become unwilling to sell their oil resources cheaply to the multinationals
8804988 since it has become more and more difficult to obtain equity and exploit rights in oil fields its good for china to participate in the development through a service contract it diversifies our oil sources and helps guarantee chinas oil supplies
8804989 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8804990 there was hundreds of square feet thousands of square feet of mold in some units
8804991 we also had sewage running down through the wall that separated the apartment from the corridor

8804994 i just messed up the time im still embarrassed about it
8804995 but you know just about everyone in the game had a time when they missed a bus or plane i did once
8804996 i said by a show of hands how many of you guys have missed a flight in your career
8804997 and it was just you know crickets so timmy had to do a little self preservation on that one
8804998 he calls a meeting and hes like are you kidding me timmy this is ridiculous he gave him the itinerary and said dude i dont want this thing to leave your sight the entire trip it was pretty funny
8804999 he has such a good spirit a good heart and this contagious energy he makes everyone relax a little bit because he just has fun hes really helped me a lot this year
8805000 timmy is very humble he doesnt think hes gods gift to baseball hes friendly to everybody he never rejects an autograph hes as down to earth as you can get
8805001 but hes just starting to understand how truly good his stuff is in the past ive heard comments like im not going to get away with that pitch now hes realizing i can get away with that and more
8805002 he can throw pitches down the middle that the rest of us cant
8805003 the acquisition of postpath complements our strategy to develop an integrated collaboration platform designed for how we work today and into the future providing real productivity gains and a more satisfying user experience
8805004 we have been unhappy with microsoft for some time before the release of exchange 2007 which included voip voice over internet protocol in its unified messaging suite it was time to offer our customers an alternative
8805005 if you think about what were going to do we usually acquire when we move into new markets that we do not have the expertise for the product segments in
8805006 once again cisco makes a sound investment in an email technology vendor just like it did with
8805007 these are the clever guys who reverse engineered the exchange client protocol mapi rpc and the related on the wire details needed to make a vanilla install of outlook talk to a non exchange mail server with full fidelity impressive stuff of all the other exchange alternatives postpath has the most interesting architecture and i say that as one who has years emotionally invested in the openmail technology
8805008 i think cisco fell out of love with microsoft a while back something to do with voip support in exchange and how cisco thought it was microsofts partner but it turned out that microsoft was competing with them nothing familiar there at all
8805009 sounds like cisco wants to offer saas collaboration based on postpath and webex whoever said the email world has become dull and uninteresting
8805010 the real problem is that too many people believe that everyone needs the feature set of exchange
8805011 there is a lot of stress and pressure in this program
8805012 i read that space is non euclidean and curved by matter how do we know the laws of trigonometry or of light intensity over a given distance are true

8805015 it didnt present itself that way to me as a child my main question was
8805016 at this point i cant say what we expect from this feature were just curious to see how it will be used
8805017 unfortunately because the examples he provides are still only experiments we cannot talk in length about how they work if we end up rolling out this experiment for all users we would definitely be able to talk in more detail right now we are experimenting with a number of factors so we cant really explain how the final product would work
8805018 we test almost everything even things that you would think are so small that we could not possibly care nor could they possibly matter in fact small changes do matter and we do care
8805019 when the driver wants to turn to right the rotational manner of electromagnetic force in the right wheel decreases

8805021 het is duidelijk dat ik na mijn periode bij het nederlands elftal een heel positief beeld van hem heb al zie ik zijn rol bij ajax heel anders dan die hij bij oranje uitvoert ik denk dat hij een geschikte algemeen directeur is
8805022 surely we can believe that our gay and lesbian brothers deserve to visit someone they love in a hospital
8805023 excuse me sir you are wearing cutoff shorts with doc marten combat boots you cant come in
8805024 by and large i agree with what he has done and the way he is handling this situation
8805025 if i were running for president right now against him it would be hard for me to step up and say i would do it different thats a cheap shot
8805026 why else would he mccain define middle class as someone who makes under 5 million a year

8805031 nine later and i was throwing up outside of car he threatened to send me the cleaning bill if i was sick inside

8805046 ive not felt this happy since discovering i have aids
8805047 i would argue that if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top 3 4 percent in this country
8805048 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
8805049 some of the richest people ive known in my life are the most unhappy rich should be defined by a home a good job an education and the ability to hand our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one we inherited
8805050 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8805051 i know this is being thought a lot about in washington and at the white house and discussed and i suspect they will monitor it carefully and figure out what to do
8805052 is bewildered by the amount of hot air generated at political party conventions in the us he bets you could run a steel mill with it for a year

8805056 i know that its best for babies to be breast fed after they are born but after trying lots of different methods i still cant squeeze a lot out
8805057 most of the women have no more breast milk left after half a year and some 20 30 of women who have given birth dont even lactate after the child reaches the age of one month the ones who can persist to one year are few
8805058 in fact the majority of women should be able to satisfy the breast feeding needs of their babies according to the lactation stimulation reflex

8805084 we would hope to have the corporation profitable again by then
8805085 at this point the future is so cloudy in terms of the development of the market when its going to pick up again
8805086 im coming into yosemite but i only have one day
8805087 this time of year when we get building high pressure extra warm temperatures and calm conditions we occasionally have large oak trees or oak limbs that will fall down without any rot or outwardly visible things that we can see wrong with them
8805088 we have put out a general warning to not fall asleep under heavy oaks on these hot days and not leave immobile people such as infants or the elderly under large oak trees even though the shade may be inviting
8805089 it seems to be that oak trees that have plenty of water are the most likely to fail
8805090 so in yosemite it is mostly along the river bottoms
8805091 one of my favorite items is a bookmark leaflet entitled
8805092 if i had p nr again i would trade a lot of my as for a lot more steak and lobster dinners during rush week
8805093 how do i plan my schedule so i can graduate mit with 2 double majors and 2 double minors
8805094 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8805095 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8805096 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8805097 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8805098 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8805099 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8805100 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8805101 washington has been talking about oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8805102 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8805103 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8805104 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8805105 i am being politically persecuted by those defeated yesterday in a just and necessary war
8805106 the ones we defeated abandoned their armed struggle and morphed into peaceful civilians
8805107 nobody can free their homeland by killing their fellow countrymen
8805108 i couldnt make it out at first it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness
8805109 there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman
8805110 we are aware of the reports and we are looking at what can be done to identify the remains and establish whether they are of an australian and if they date back to the second world war
8805111 its too early to speculate on the nationality of the airman or the circumstances of his death there were allied australian and american and japanese airmen who would have been flying over the area in the war
8805112 a number of allied aircraft had been reported as missing in the area in particular b25 mitchells and a number of kittyhawk aircraft
8805113 gt many new small businesses fail during the early years and one of the reasons attributed for the failure is their inability to beat the competition
8805114 marketing is about testing and evaluating your return on investment but its primarily about helping people get what they want
8805115 people still are used to deflation and now theyre starting to see the prices of their daily necessities going up sharply
8805116 looking ahead the contribution from high energy prices should diminish
8805117 well see what happens but were in good shape the gap in the championship is big but well keep fighting until its over
8805118 we had a great result at misano last year and that added to the fact that were in good shape with the set up and the tyres means we can be reasonably confident of another good result here
8805119 im really excited to be going to misano in such good shape and leading the championship
8805120 last year the race was a huge disappointment for us a very low point of the season and especially sad because it happened in front of my home fans
8805121 but this time things are very different weve had two fantastic races in a row and we are feeling very strong and very confident we are out to make up for 2007
8805122 misano is so close to my home town of tavullia that i know there will be an army of italian fans there and i hope its going to be a great party for all of them
8805123 last year there was some terrible weather before the race as well so i really hope that this year we have sunshine and we can enjoy a fantastic race by the sea
8805124 i am hoping that we can have a better weekend at misano though i had bad luck there last year another rider knocked me off at the very first corner
8805125 pad will take total responsibility for security at government house so we have asked all police to handover to us
8805126 there are no longer any police inside and senior police will today meet to respond to this action
8805127 because of the over the top charges especially the charge of treason
8805128 microfinancing is different from conventional banking and it is evident that most of the nations microfinance banks are not doing microfinance banking they still engage in the old conventional way of banking practice which can not sustain the nations economy
8805129 this represents a parallel approach for how to make cells in regenerative medicine

8805131 what is the right price for this product are the materials and colors as attractive as possible
8805132 looking for people to bring new and exciting products to the market
8805133 if i had to do it all over again rather than build an old style type of business i would have started building a network marketing business
8805134 network marketing has come of age its a way to independence for millions
8805135 my whole career has been built around the concept that you can have everything in life that you want if you will just help enough people get what they want network marketing more than any other structure ive ever seen brings that concept into manifestation
8805136 how is it i may serve during this holiday season
8805137 thats not on another planet is it dont they have internet there

8805144 going forward whether core measures of cpi excluding food and energy would show signs of inflation would be the key factor in determining the bank of japans actions
8805145 at least hamels wasnt out here to give that up
8805146 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8805147 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8805148 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
8805149 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
8805150 we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8805151 sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8805152 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8805153 the stronger fundamental data is helping to give the dollar a boost
8805154 the dollar is up on u s strength but also uk weakness
8805155 housing there is in real rough shape though the sterling is still relatively high historically
8805156 the fed must be very pleased with that number but theres still a bit of disconnect between the pce and the headline inflation number
8805157 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8805158 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8805159 the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors
8805160 obama would have needed to channel martin luther king jr on a steroids to knock our socks off this implies that mccain will get a bigger bounce than obama from his convention appearance well see
8805161 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8805162 once more it was really angry and nasty and not positive at all
8805163 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8805164 what he said about gays lesbians and about abortion at the end was not boilerplate
8805165 of course we have killed 1000s of al qaeda fighters in iraq and there are no longer any al qaeda fighters in afghanistan where obama claims to want to send troops
8805166 it was a lot of empty promises an platitudes and outright lies in other words democrat boilerplate
8805167 remember to the younger folks this tired old crap is brand new so theyve yet to run into the cynicism the realities of the world brings
8805168 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8805169 as a black person you cant get white people behind you so therefore the white candidate should be the candidate
8805170 the first part of his speech cast the american nation as one of a nation of victims whom somehow some way government would save
8805171 remember this john mccain we all put our country first
8805172 even pat buchanan called it the best convention speech hed ever seen
8805173 if you bothered to read anything you would know that afghanistan is now a civil war and al quede is not there anymore it is in nw pakistan if you dont think that is true the produce a link or some evidence that al qeada is there until then shut the fuck up and go read a little on subject you might learn something but a doubt it
8805174 hes going to be a better commander in chief even though he has shown weakness and naivety at every opportunity like georgia
8805175 of course we have killed 1000s of al qaeda fighters in iraq and there are no longer any al qaeda fighters in afghanistan where obama claims to want to send troops
8805176 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities
8805177 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8805178 the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8805179 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8805180 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8805181 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8805182 did you find any weapons of mass destruction in iraq
8805183 it doesnt matter what we do drill research alternative energy raise cafe standards in 2018 well still be using oil
8805184 if a price competitive solar heating system came out tomorrow would you run out and buy one or would you wait until the oil heater broke
8805185 moreover cutting our consumption of oil will not do anything to reduce our dependance on oil from the middle east the middle east will be the last place to close the taps
8805186 and it will remain critical not just because our battery technology is not up to a thoroughgoing changeover in our transportation system
8805187 but also because we use oil for other things plastics you may have noticed theres quite a lot of that stuff around in a lot of important consumer goods
8805188 avgas we wont get battery powered planes any time soon
8805189 fertilizer upon which the green revolution depends without petrochemicals and natural gas derivatives soylent green would look prescient instead of silly
8805190 and putting a man on the moon and the manhattan project are totally different from energy development careful what words you throw at people in glasses houses
8805191 if we can end our dependence on foreign oil in ten years it will be a major blessing for the nations economy why quibble and carp
8805192 look up nasa and the manhattan project read what you can about them then punch yourself hard in the face 10 times because you deserve it
8805193 its because its just the way it is and nothing is going to change that
8805194 it makes perfect sense that the manhattan project came from the government they were developing a weapon of immense power not an item for which theres too much demand outside the government and it would have had to be one that could fund and buy the thing so clearly a major power qed the usa on the other hand theres a huge payoff waiting for whoever develops alternative energy products and can do so efficiently hello hybrid car sales and honda being the only car manufacturer turning a profit because those consumers are by and large your average person and companies already know that plenty of market based incentive there
8805195 market based incentive to come up with a car that gets 100 miles to the gallon too you could say but it hasnt happened is it possible the sacred sacred market doesnt actually work perfectly is it possible innovation is stifled by the beyond huge titans of industry
8805196 unless the us overcomes its commitment to libertarianism its chief role will continue to be what it has been especially for the last 30 years
8805197 sorry but a pet peeve obamas father was not an immigrant he was a student who came here to study with no intention of staying and he abandoned his first family on the way in and his second family on the way out
8805198 i am conservative and there are no circumstances under which i would vote for obama it has nothing to do with whether hes inspiring it has to do with the fact that his policies as shown by his scant voting record will drive us the country into ruin and put countless american lives through needless misery as he tries to kill the economy through overregulation and redistributionism

8805472 budgeted sales levels are well down on expectations and that runs the clear risk of the next step being a shedding of labour in the industry

8805476 i have not heard from the packers since before the draft
8805477 my ears are definitely opened to listen if they need a proven backup for aaron
8805478 i am just not convinced that the teams are listening
8805479 im going to say it for about the 100th time it takes time ok
8805480 it takes time to develop young quarterbacks and thats where we are im excited about their future but weve got work to do
8805481 i dont think we need to bring in a veteran backup because i think all three of us are ready to go
8805482 there are a few things id like to change we got into a rhythm and i didnt want to come out of the game
8805483 hopefully in these next few days we can heal up
8805484 everyone knows were pretty banged up it will be nice to get some rest and get all our guys back and be 100 percent for dallas
8805485 the plan was to get a couple of three and outs and then take the players out but it didnt turn out that way we didnt play well believe me if we could put our finger on it we would have done something about it before now weve got a little bit more time to get it right
8805486 we havent played well that is all you can say about it we have not made all the effort we need to play well all the things that go into playing well we havent done once we get all our guys going i feel we will have a very strong defense
8805487 we would have liked to have a touchdown on that first one which was a little upsetting
8805488 this is the best i have felt since early in houston
8805489 i have played decent games where i have not felt good
8805490 i felt i sporadically made plays and things lucked into happening tonight i was in control of what was going on and that hasnt happened in a long time
8805491 when the regular season starts its a whole new ballgame
8805492 we know that is it nice to win the games yeah but it doesnt mean anything weve had good records in preseason weve had bad records in preseason what counts is how you play in the regular season
8805493 we still have a lot of work to do and we have to get better
8805494 the preseason is over and kansas city is coming in we have to be ready nobody is waiting for us we had a bad day but we have to put that behind us there are no concerns we have to move forward and move on
8805495 thats really what i needed to see because i havent seen that
8805496 ive only seen a couple of carries and when youre only getting a couple of carries its hard to have that kind of swagger as he got going he felt pretty good and it was nice to see him score
8805497 thats a hard one because im really wanting to see him get the live snaps but theres still that clock in his head and in our head that says you know what
8805498 i think hes real close well have him ready this week to play and thats the plan
8805499 ive still got a couple tricks up my sleeve its just making plays taking what the defense gives me and if thats something that i have to do i have the ability to do it
8805500 i think i was pressing a little bit just trying to create something early in the preseason just coming off the injury today i felt more relaxed
8805501 just to make plays and finally get the crowd reaction on your side felt good

8805518 as australias largest home loan provider it makes good strategic sense to look at alternative investments in this industry that will continue to bring benefits to shareholders and consumers mr norris said
8805519 represents the merging of two industry leaders with common cultures and common visions for the future
8805520 the new identity is intended to reflect the combined companys leadership position internationally and status as the worlds largest recycler as well as its commitment to sustainability and resources management in an industry which by its very nature is truly green
8805521 the new identity will be put to shareholders for approval at the companys annual general meeting sims reported earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation ebitda were up 69 3 per cent on 2007 to 777 9 million
8805522 the merger between sims group and metal management which closed on 14 march 2008 was the obvious highlight but a further eight acquisitions were completed during the year across all regions in both metal recycling and e recycling
8805523 the sims adams joint venture in southern california which was established in the first half of the year has already delivered significant value and offers great opportunity for future growth
8805524 reflects robust market conditions in the second half of the year resulting in record ferrous contributions experienced towards the end of the reporting period particularly from the north american business
8805525 as we look ahead into the first quarter of fy09 despite a much tougher ferrous trading climate we anticipate a strong result albeit one not as strong as the fourth quarter of fy08 mr dienst said
8805526 this confidence is based on a review of july results a good forward sales position the achievement of targeted merger synergies and continued strong contributions by our southern californian joint venture
8805527 a lower australian us dollar exchange rate and lower freights are also positives which will partially offset the decline in ferrous prices
8805528 the degree to which these efforts are successful will to a large extent determine the outlook for earnings into the second quarter

8805532 he became very impatient with us and with the coaches as well
8805533 he is at the top of the totem pole his stress goes down to everyone else you can definitely see a difference when he is having a good day were all having a good day when he is having a bad day were all having a bad day with him not being in a role where he has to control everything he is allowed to actually calm down
8805534 i walked gloria out to the car and she said you know james he just seems happier and healthier than he has been in years
8805535 now you know why i hired your butt i about near killed myself doing the head coaching job and everything else it is hard to do it really is hard to do i am enjoying this to be honest with you i have a chance to be closer with the kids
8805536 it makes the players remember that he has not forgotten them
8805537 we have 100 and something guys and people can get lost in that mix and think coach doesnt care about me and i can do whatever i want having these daily or weekly meetings with players it makes you realize wow he really has time invested in this program and in me

8805552 maintaining the underlying value of the business has been a major focus of the management team mr rufran said
8805553 the headline loss of 2055 million does not reflect the operating performance of the group for the past financial year
8805554 after adding back the above items to the headline result the underlying earnings are 242 million
8805555 our tenants are heavily weighted toward necessity orientated retailers such as supermarkets and discount stores and it is these retailers that continue to perform solidly when economic conditions start to slow mr rufrano said
8805556 the level of development activity has slowed with the current development program being 194 million centro said

8805573 it was a great job by david carr coming in and leading the offense it was a good start gives us a little momentum and a little confidence boost so were excited about starting the season
8805574 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8805575 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8805576 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8805577 hes angry and ready for a fight he is innocent we will try this case it is nothing but a false accusation
8805578 after a very difficult 17 months i feel like i have finally been validated
8805579 i am relieved to find that even federal judges are not above the law and that sexual abuse in the workplace is never acceptable no matter the status of the offender
8805580 ive been through typhoons monsoons tornadoes hurricanes and every other phoon soon or storm im not worried
8805581 we think its fantastic to have such an iconic olympian be part of our bid and be here to support it
8805582 its going to have a very detrimental impact on the whole system and the children that we care for
8805583 these layoffs will have an indirect impact in terms of creating greater barriers for those who need help accessing basic needs
8805584 due to the serious hazard these bassinets pose to babies cpsc urges all consumers to share this safety warning with day care centers consignment stores family and friends to ensure that no child is placed to sleep in a simplicity convertible bassinet covered by this warning

8805591 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
8805592 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
8805593 i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8805594 he slapped at rival john mccain even as he called for an end to washingtons partisan politics including appeals for common ground on contentious issues abortion gay rights gun control and immigration and he addressed nearly every major criticism of himself and his campaign head on
8805595 i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8805596 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8805597 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8805598 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead
8805599 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief
8805600 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8805601 i felt like i wanted to cry i felt like it was about the people he hit it out of the park
8805602 but he talked about substance hes thinking of our future and talking about all the right things thats what people need to hear
8805603 a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8805604 ive already spoken to technical support and or ram guy

8805606 the student cannot express truths that count for him he learns a language that prevents him from working towards truths and then he tells lies
8805607 i will talk to the prime minister about this matter later today with the concrete evidence that she will know that these allegations are vile malevolent malicious and wrong
8805608 why would they never ever come and talk to me if they had an intention of coming to talk to me
8805609 kangaroo court of public opinion organised by the media in this country and others
8805610 reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8805611 it was clear to me then there were two quite different points of view at that point it becomes a matter between mr glenn and mr peters and the news media it is not a matter for me
8805612 after receiving an order for a withdrawal from south ossetia we have started to load and are preparing to move
8805613 we believe that into the period of 2009 youll start to see economic growth picking up he told fairfax radio
8805614 if you go with the forecasts which were released by the reserve bank in august you see growth by the june quarter 2009 improving to two and a quarter and then by the end of next year to two and a half he said
8805615 id much rather be up front about that with the australian people rather than pretending that its any different
8805616 its a big challenge and its been a big challenge frankly since day one
8805617 australia is not immune to whats going on around the world the key thing is what youre doing about it and our plan in response to that is to first of all make sure that we dont put further upwards pressure on inflation interest rates thats our 22 billion surplus
8805618 secondly to make sure were investing in the countrys long term productivity growth thats what were talking about with the eduction revolution
8805619 thats the third part of our economic strategy for the future but its going to be tough i dont want to mislead people
8805620 really difficult time for australians which was why the government was focused on creating a budget position to enable the reserve bank to cut interest rates
8805621 you want to know something as well as all that there are fairys down the bottom of the garden
8805622 pet dog cassie confronted the creature which was identified on the internet as a camel spider but ran out whimpering when it hissed at her

8805625 you are going to find out rather quickly that fileboss is without a doubt the best and most versatile windows explorer replacement ever made
8805626 today i decided that i needed to rename some of the roma images
8805627 theres abandonment everywhere this is an especially bad time because its kitten season too
8805628 people are viewing pets as a temporary fix a feel good thing
8805629 too many people are letting cats have kittens and taking kittens but then when theyre six months old they dont want them anymore when they realize they actually have to spend money on them
8805630 the economics i think is in general adding to something we already see every year during the summer
8805631 we are still getting owner surrenders in for various reasons a lot of it could be because of the cost of spaying or neutering and the cost of general care and it does have to do with the economy
8805632 weve seen several dogs as well as cats brought in because people have to move people who were living in homes now are living in cars a lot of times people are just having a really bad situation happen to them and theyre just trying to do the best they can by their animals
8805633 usually were very lucky in that we have really good adoptions
8805634 for the most part adoptions have been up i think because people are aware of the economic situation and most people are caring and want to help
8805635 obviously those wont be part of the norwood design so i think we can take those out and add the pillars and clock tower which are part of our community at no net cost
8805636 nothings been voted on yet and we dont have any prices at this point
8805637 i think this rendering shows the message that were trying to keep some historic value in the building
8805638 the biggest thing is that were listening to the community
8805639 we know these things are important to the town and the taxpayers and were trying to accommodate that
8805640 i look at it as a physical education laboratory not just fields
8805641 the fields question is something where we still need more answers
8805642 i saw a couple of drag queens out there one of em looked more like me than i ever will and the other one was prettier than any of us girls will ever be so this is for the drag queens and this is for you
8805643 what im doing is being very loyal to them for what they have done for my community
8805644 there are some things i would like to get done
8805645 at some point theres got to be some kind of understanding so other business can get done
8805646 the engineers of the titanic thought the ship would sail but they were wrong
8805647 people know the price of everything and the value of nothing
8805648 if theres something we can do on a temporary basis well do it
8805649 by putting these things forward were only saving money down the road with escalating costs
8805650 you want people to think well of you dont you
8805651 if you believe its time for a change then vote for barack obama
8805652 a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division
8805653 mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8805654 have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact
8805655 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8805656 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8805657 we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8805658 borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8805659 represents a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division
8805660 barack obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises
8805661 his leadership experience has given him a unique capacity to inspire hope in the promise of the american dream of a boundless future
8805662 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8805663 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8805664 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8805665 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8805666 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8805667 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
8805668 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
8805669 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
8805670 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
8805671 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america

8805677 i doubt anyone here would argue that election didnt matter
8805678 and we wouldnt be denying the climate crisis wed be solving the climate crisis
8805679 i believe this election is close because the powers of the status quo are desperately afraid of the kind of change that barack obama represents
8805680 wir sind alle cyborgs weil wir jeden tag technische hilfsmittel benutzen
8805681 i use broad as a moniker of respect for a woman who knows how to throw a mean right
8805682 conversation is the art of never appearing a bore of knowing how to say everything interestingly to entertain with no matter what to be charming with nothing at all
8805683 etiquette is for those without manners in the same way that fashion is for those without style
8805684 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
8805685 ive already spoken to technical support and or ram guy

8805689 liran conduce la classifica mondiale per numero di esecuzioni di minorenni allepoca del reato
8805690 in tutti gli altri paesi ci si sta muovendo per labolizione di questa pratica orribile mentre in iran il numero di condanne a morte sembra essere in aumento
8805691 uccidere persone per crimini commessi in minore eta non e fare giustizia ne rende piu sicura la societa iraniana
8805692 il fatto che le autorita iraniane mentano agli avvocati e privino le famiglie dellultima possibilita di vedere i propri cari e la prova del pervertimento morale di queste esecuzioni
8805693 for small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love
8805694 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight years
8805695 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8805696 alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8805697 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace who yearn for a better future
8805698 we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to walk into the future
8805699 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meagre record of barack obama
8805700 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8805701 we are all the children of the dream and he is here in all of our hearts and minds
8805702 but not only that he is in the hopes and dreams the competence and courage the rightness and readiness of barack obama
8805703 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8805704 we can carry barack obamas message of hope and change to every family in america
8805705 when we talked about an open convention this is what the democrats meant
8805706 the president of the republic has asked the managing director of the imf to look into the possible use of these exceptional profits to promote
8805707 when youre in the winning business versus the institutional business those are two different worlds i hope all teams apply their best efforts to take the best player available to them
8805708 i think its time for the pirates and mr coonelly to come clean with the fans of pittsburgh and let everyone know about their dealings with pedro alvarez
8805709 but that tells you a lot about those two there is no love lost there at all
8805710 may not agree verbally or in writing to be represented by an athlete agent for the purpose of marketing the ability or reputation
8805711 i am telling you this is a good kid thats the real perspective on this i know him my family knows him he has time for everyone no ego at all you know there are two sides to every story and somewhere in the middle is the truth i know that with the fan base in pittsburgh there are some people disappointed right now but they dont know the kid like i do

8805713 a bad episode of 24 the french director insists studio executives battled against him throughout the sci fi movies production first slashing his budget and later cutting
8805714 and i had 30 minutes to file and i didnt have anything to say
8805715 im not a member of any organized party im a democrat
8805716 the most powerful part of this campaign is its integrated nature there are 120 different executions touchpoints along the consumer journey to make sure that it feels consistent with a closer connection between the campaign and orange
8805717 i doubt anyone would argue now that the 2000 election didnt matter
8805718 mccain is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies those policies all over again
8805719 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8805720 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8805721 with john mccains support president bush and vice president cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short circuit the rule of law
8805722 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you believe its time for a change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8805723 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8805724 abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
8805725 a change from the approach of bush cheney and mccain
8805726 abandon ing the search for the terrorists who attacked us
8805727 because it would bring in his words shame disgrace and ruin to our nation
8805728 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress
8805729 was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land
8805730 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8805731 i believe this election is close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change obama represents
8805732 we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama the next president of the united states
8805733 i believe in recycling but recycling bushs policies is ridiculous
8805734 this election is actually not close at all among younger voters
8805735 we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8805736 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8805737 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8805738 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8805739 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet
8805740 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8805741 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8805742 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8805743 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8805744 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8805745 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8805746 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8805747 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8805748 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt matter who became president
8805749 today we face the same choice we faced in 2000
8805750 barack obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises
8805751 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in war in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8805752 a century and a half ago when america faced our greatest trial the end of one era gave birth to another
8805753 the candidate who emerged victorious in that election is now regarded by most historians as our greatest president
8805754 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield ill and one term in congress during which he showed the courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country that was popular when it started but later condemned by history
8805755 one of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity it offers us every four years to change course
8805756 its not a guarantee its an opportunity the question facing us is simply put will we seize this opportunity for change
8805757 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome
8805758 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8805759 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle class families
8805760 we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation and we would not be denying the climate crisis we would be solving it
8805761 today we face essentially the same choice was faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8805762 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8805763 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is so close today because i believe the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
8805764 this same industry has spent a half a billion dollars this year alone trying to convince the public they are actually solving the problem when they in fact are making it worse every day
8805765 after they wrecked our economy it is time for a change after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change
8805766 after they abandoned the american principle first laid down by general george washington when he prohibited the torture of captives because it would bring in his words shame disgrace and ruin to our nation its time for a change
8805767 when as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president and john mccain promises to appoint more scalias and thomases and end a womans right to choose its time for a change
8805768 the experience lincolns supporters value most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future in a time of impasse
8805769 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land
8805770 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
8805771 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the force of change barack obama represents
8805772 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8805773 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8805774 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8805775 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8805776 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8805777 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve experienced in the history of humankind
8805778 not only in the heat of this election but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country
8805779 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8805780 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
8805781 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
8805782 the only time i ever saw my mother really angry was when she saw cruelty
8805783 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8805784 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
8805785 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
8805786 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
8805787 promises to appoint more antonin scalias and clarence thomases and end a womans right to choose
8805788 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8805789 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheny white house and promising to actually continue them hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8805790 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power
8805791 i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8805792 no no jimmy stewart for governor ronald reagan for best friend
8805793 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that that election didnt matter
8805794 when he walks out on stage tonight in front of 75 000 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election
8805795 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
8805796 it was a very close election and certainly for a lot of people at that time who said theres no difference between al gore and
8805797 we came late so we wouldnt have a line and we havent had a line yet
8805798 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president gore said
8805799 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter mccain aides monitoring gustav as convention nears
8805800 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
8805801 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
8805802 inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8805803 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
8805804 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
8805805 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8805806 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8805807 may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8805808 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous with john mccains support president bush and vice president cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short circuit the rule of law
8805809 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield ill
8805810 the experience lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8805811 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8805812 the more i learn about nobama the more i hope he disappears from the political arena completely
8805813 lincoln killed well over half a million of his own citizens i wouldnt consider being compared to lincoln a positive
8805814 if it wasnt for lincoln there would probably 4 different countries between canada and mexico
8805815 with john mccains support president bush and vice president cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact
8805816 dont be sheep aug 28 2008 10 14 54 pm
8805817 al gore has done more to raise awareness of global environmental issues than anyone on earth i think
8805818 in his state of the union addresses as president he twice called for the deportation of blacks
8805819 i believe it would be better to export them all to some fertile country with a good climate which they could have to themselves
8805820 clinton and gore have the blood of 3 000 americans going to work on sept 11 2001 on their hands how dare we give either of them the time of day they are pathetic and immoral at least our soldiers in the middle east are trained and armed my son went to work in lower manhattan that day armed with his briefcase
8805821 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield ill and one term in congress during which he showed the courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country
8805822 odd that he would compare obama with the first republican president
8805823 the number of problems both at home and abroad are more significant and i think the desire for a change new leadership and a new vision is needed now more than ever
8805824 embora a petrobras que sujeita s regras de mercado seja relativamente enxuta qualquer nova companhia estatal poder rapidamente ficar inchada por indica es pol ticas
8805825 al m disso o governo pode ficar tentado a revisar contratos existentes o que seria ruim para a confian a e desastroso para a petrobras e seus parceiros
8805826 deixar de fora os acionistas estrangeiros da petrobras pode afugentar os investidores estrangeiros do brasil como um todo
8805827 no entanto antes de se adiantar o governo deve primeiro assegurar que isso n o vai prejudicar a companhia que encontrou o tesouro em primeiro lugar
8805828 eles est o dizendo que a redu o de gastos em ti est se espalhando isso evid ncia de desacelera o global do gasto em ti isto certamente n o bom para o setor tecnol gico em geral a perspectiva da dell de menor gastos especialmente na sia e europa ocidental

8805830 the following problem is a quite fundamental problem in robotics
8805831 approximately 12 million people a year in the u s seek medical care for impacted or excessive cerumen
8805832 this leads to nearly 8 million cerumen removal procedures by health care professionals developing practical clinical guidelines for physicians to understand the harm vs benefit profile of the intervention was essential
8805833 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove cerumen from the ears
8805834 this can result in further impaction and other complications to the ear canal
8805835 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and ongoing including infections and hearing loss
8805836 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes

8805840 l ha sido herido por nuestras rebeld as molido por nuestras culpas el soport el castigo que nos trae la paz y con sus cardenales hemos sido curados
8805841 pedro se lo llev aparte y se puso a reprenderlo no te lo permita dios se or
8805842 se or est s equivocado est s desvariando dios no permitir que eso le suceda a su mes as a su hijo

8805844 el que quiera venir conmigo que se niegue a s mismo que cargue con su cruz y me siga
8805845 en especial a los promotores de movimientos populares que muy a menudo se inspiraban en ideales mesi nicos
8805846 lo que es la voluntad de dios lo bueno lo agradable lo perfecto

8805853 nos reunimos para sitiar a dios con nuestras oraciones y como si nos tom semos de las manos para hacer violencia agradable a dios
8805854 imposible que las oraciones de muchos hombres no sean escuchadas si por decirlo as forman una sola
8805855 s lo hay un mediador entre dios y los hombres jesucristo hombre que se entreg a s mismo como redentor de todos
8805856 clinton is the first woman to run for this prestigious office
8805857 yo creo en el reciclaje pero este reciclaje que mccain hace de bush es rid culo
8805858 sportsmen have been stereotyped as concerned with one issue guns but if you listen to sportsmen as i have over the years we hear a different story
8805859 democrats are all about conservation they are all about preservation i think thats a huge opportunity
8805860 with sen obama you have a lifetime record of supporting gun control voting for gun control speaking out against gun rights and voting against gun rights either as an elected official or a private citizen
8805861 i want to get young people everywhere engaged and active and really questioning
8805862 what right do older generations have to jeopardize our future
8805863 we wanted to kick off in the most effective way possible and unite kids from all over the place
8805864 i always wanted to do something for the environment but i didnt know what to do
8805865 i thank these girls for the effort they put it this is a fine day i really learned a lot
8805866 candidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
8805867 there are not many papers that go right to the core of some of the assumptions of democratic theory the way this one does
8805868 c andidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
8805869 the way to influence behavior like that is to first raise peoples level of consciousness
8805870 we know were not perfect but were always striving to do the best for the environment
8805871 there is currently no company policy about opening or closing doors but we acknowledge the need to minimize energy use and are investigating different strategies such as using air fans which would prevent the cold air from leaving the building even with the door open
8805872 i would say something about it we are the customers and so i think they would value hearing from us
8805873 i would probably go in and say were all trying to conserve energy pasadena is a very green city so it would be best if you didnt pour your air conditioning into the outside world and i might say that im not inclined to shop in a place that hasnt caught on to the green spirit of pasadena
8805874 plea for a politics of consensus serving as a warning against single issue political movements or against the separation of america into racial ethnic or gender based constituencies
8805875 we are facing a planetary emergency which is not like anything we have experienced in the history of humankind
8805876 the solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon based fossil fuels
8805877 we need to invest in innovation i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out to tackle that
8805878 now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning mandatory caps on planet warming carbon
8805879 the carbon based industries have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for all its worth
8805880 taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8805881 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving the climate crisis
8805882 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8805883 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8805884 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
8805885 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
8805886 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
8805887 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
8805888 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
8805889 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
8805890 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
8805891 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
8805892 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
8805893 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
8805894 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
8805895 ce soir je dis au peuple dam rique aux d mocrates aux r publicains et aux ind pendants dans tout ce grand pays a suffit
8805896 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8805897 the central bank shall continue to keep an eye on domestic liquidity trends to ensure that liquidity growth is supportive of non inflationary economic growth
8805898 i didnt win and thats ok but im not going away
8805899 i didnt feel nervous or jittery before the game i tried not to let any of that get to me
8805900 i just saw open field and went i knew i stumbled once or twice but i never looked back i just went for the endzone
8805901 this was such a good test for us and we answered so many questions tonight
8805902 i was really pleased with mata and he defeinitely answered a lot of questions for us tonight
8805903 he is one of the best in the area and we designed our whole defensive plan around what we knew he could do and we are very happy it worked
8805904 i told our coaches dont worry about it just keep calling the game
8805905 i said lets just keep running the ball because we might not see the ball if we throw it
8805906 fredie gave us what we expected he was here all year last year it was also good to see the young guys step up its always a question mark when youve never been out here before on a friday night but handy did a great job
8805907 we wanted to set the tone and keep it going through the whole season this is a new oak ridge and a new stadium
8805908 the oxygen bottle went from the base of the aircraft to the ceiling of the first floor cabin
8805909 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8805910 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8805911 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8805912 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8805913 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8805914 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
8805915 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
8805916 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
8805917 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
8805918 my plan would provide three times more tax relief to the middle class
8805919 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
8805920 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
8805921 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
8805922 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
8805923 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
8805924 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
8805925 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks
8805926 for weeks my boy had been begging for me to please leave him somewhere anywhere and let him try to figure out how to get home on his own so on that sunny sunday i gave him a subway map a metrocard a 20 bill and several quarters just in case he had to make a call
8805927 even though each of the suspects in the anthrax murders was at some point believed to have been a terrorist who had committed a heinous crime with a weapon of mass destruction none were ever declared
8805928 russia invasion speeds georgia nato membership us reuters via nyt
8805929 aides who work in other legislative areas have been told that their issue areas are going to almost dissolve and theyll become something like support staff for the health team kennedy means to pass a bill he means to muster the full force of his legislative talents his sprawling staff his longstanding relationships and even the poignancy of his condition it will be his legacy it is his dream health care
8805930 a son of democratic vice presidential candidate joe biden was paid an undisclosed amount of money as a consultant by mbna the largest employer in delaware during the years the senator supported legislation that was promoted by the credit card industry and opposed by consumer groups
8805931 the convention exemplifies the true rot of our democracy the presidential race gets almost all of the attention and every other level of government gets none because we have come to believe democracy is just a quadrennial vote for president
8805932 a voting system used in 34 states contains a critical programming error that can cause votes to be dropped while being electronically transferred from memory cards to a central tallying point the manufacturer acknowledges
8805933 john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time
8805934 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own
8805935 we are here because we love this country too much to letthe next four years look just like the last eight
8805936 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight isenough
8805937 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacythat generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8805938 we are better than these last eight years we are a bettercountry than this
8805939 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bushwas right more than 90 percent of the time
8805940 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10percent chance on change
8805941 a clean break fromthe politics of partisanship and bitter division
8805942 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defendthis nation but i will only send our troops into harms waywith a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them theequipment they need in battle and the care and benefits theydeserve when they come home
8805943 i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that canprevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8805944 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8805945 how perfect that your nomination would come on thishistoric day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8805946 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with commenting on how i intend to help middle class families improve their lives
8805947 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8805948 everything ive learned in my eight years as president and the work ive done since has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8805949 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be president sound familiar
8805950 space based solar power as an opportunity for strategic security
8805951 the lunar infrastructure as proposed by the late gerard k oneill is well thought out
8805952 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8805953 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
8805954 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8805955 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
8805956 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
8805957 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8805958 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
8805959 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8805960 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
8805961 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
8805962 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8805963 politique d traqu e de washington et avec les checs de la pr sidence bush
8805964 am rique nous valons mieux que ces huit derni res ann es nous sommes un meilleur pays que cela
8805965 nous aimons trop ce pays pour le laisser quatre ans de plus ressembler ce que nous avons connu depuis huit ans
8805966 la politique trang re de bush mccain a d moli ce que des g n rations dam ricains d mocrates et r publicains avaient construit nous devons restaurer cet h ritage
8805967 comme commandant en chef je nh siterais jamais d fendre cette nation mais je nenverrais les troupes quavec une mission claire et un engagement sacr de leur fournir les quipements dont ils auront besoin pour combattre et les soins et pensions quils m riteront leur retour la maison
8805968 okay i can do this for a year and well see
8805969 jesp re que a se r alisera parce que a voudra dire que jaurai contribu dune fa on ou dune autre
8805970 cela veut simplement dire que je suis l depuis longtemps a dit cahoon qui est n dans lutah mais qui compte comme joueur canadien car ses parents sont canadiens il a pass son enfance en alberta
8805971 cela veut dire que jai t entour de co quipiers formidables qui mont permis de me lib rer et de faire mon travail cest agr able mais je serai beaucoup plus satisfait si on gagne le match cest un match dune tr s haute importance et ce point ci de ma carri re jai finalement r alis que les victoires sont plus importantes que les statistiques individuelles
8805972 think of it this way the people having the most kids today are uneducated and poor so within a few years we will have a pretty dumb country
8805973 i agree with so many of you but particularly with
8805974 tell this headline to every uneducated person from a third world or
8805975 let this limited children initiative start with the third world countries and the islamic families that are currently trying to out produce the rest of us in order to take over
8805976 i wish i had know this before we had three
8805977 as usual another bible thumper that cannot offer proof to back up his beliefs
8805978 to muttonhead31 since you asked i will respond by repeating myself look around you
8805979 that mountain is not really there everyone is just imagining it
8805980 mixdown it is not a personal attack it is math
8805981 to mixdown you believe there is a god and thats what this country is all about but show me the proof that u speak of
8805982 about the argument over being frugal with resources in having more than two kids
8805983 to the jackal if you cant find proof that god exists then you are blind
8805984 wowsers this from scientists that are generally left of center politically and all in favor of the usa becoming north mexico in a few years
8805985 i recently saw a item on this on pbs and was shocked at how soon this is goign to become a global problem
8805986 i cant believe that people get so up in arms about the suggestion that they not have huge families i have chosen not to have kids and am regularly attacked for the decision by people who do choose to have them
8805987 charlie hustle you should run for president on that platform
8805988 in america we have generations of welfare recipients who beleive the more kids you have the more the government will reward you so why would they ever stop having children besides how else would the women be able to buy those new 24
8805989 i myself have only two children but i resent the premise of these arguments
8805990 it is about time someone took this thought process public in a more aggressive manner
8805991 one third of your generation has been killed by abortion in america
8805992 until american apparel starts manufacturing shoes which whould be unprecedentedly awesome by the way im on my own when it comes to finding simple unadorned shoe styles
8805993 we believe that the 12 executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilize the state
8805994 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
8805995 he stole the ground from under our feet and he took the sky from above our heads he killed our sons
8805996 he is doing fine he is undergoing some checkups the doctors have told us that absolutely there is no cause for concern
8805997 we do not intend to curtail peoples freedom or right to express themselves everyone is subjected to the law even websites and blogs
8805998 this is merely the first step in a comprehensive and reprehensible attempt to curb the access of conscientious malaysians to the internet
8805999 i didnt think that they would go ahead because their own charter guarantees no censorship
8806000 this is the first time they officially blocked my website
8806001 full of meaning and full of opportunity and if you as i believe and i know a lot of you do we did not lose the last election nor did al gore lose his last election we won it
8806002 ill screw around on my sick wife and make her lie in front of the cameras about it
8806003 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8806004 barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president and he lost bruce babbit ran for president and he lost for this next election thats one arizona political tradition id like to see continue
8806005 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush more than 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8806006 i will always call him governor bush because thats the last political office he was legitimately elected to
8806007 and it is now under investion they were fixed computors
8806008 there are too many republican robber barons in this nation and they exist and survive vy the use of the worst deceptive practices and tactics paying out to those whod sell their souls to put their republican puppet in the white house to enrich themselves and destroy america and its middle class and its working population these robber barons need to be crushed to a pulp to save america and its leadership in the world
8806009 fewer believe that those provided the margin of victory or that kerry was robbed of victory the way democrats think gore was robbed
8806010 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8806011 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8806012 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8806013 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8806014 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8806015 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8806016 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8806017 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8806018 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8806019 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8806020 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8806021 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8806022 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8806023 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8806024 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8806025 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8806026 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8806027 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8806028 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8806029 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8806030 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8806031 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8806032 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8806033 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8806034 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8806035 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8806036 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8806037 the barackopolis open thread reaction to obamas coronation speech added
8806038 europe has had female leaders for years whats the big deal
8806039 es una oportunidad que no podemos dejar escapar se ha apresurado a declarar john leighton director de la instituci n escocesa que alberga los tiziano perderlos ser a como si el louvre se quedase sin la mona lisa los uffizi de florencia sin los botticelli o el prado sin sus mejores vel zquez y goya
8806040 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8806041 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8806042 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8806043 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8806044 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8806045 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8806046 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8806047 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8806048 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8806049 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8806050 je crois que des enqu teurs devraient se rendre la maison de repos et je crois que lusine lorigine de l closion devrait faire lobjet dune enqu te tr s tr s pouss e

8806054 son dispositivos preventivos convenientemente desplegados para demostrar a estos grupos que estamos encima
8806055 queremos que quede claro que no hay barra libre para tener comportamientos violentos en el espacio p blico
8806056 estados unidos es mucho mejor que lo que hemos vivido en estos ocho a os
8806057 es un hombre que se merece nuestro respeto porque ha sido soldado y ha defendido al pa s con valent a pero no puede darnos el cambio que se merece ee uu
8806058 john mccain ha votado con george bush el 90 por ciento de las veces al senador mccain le gusta hablar de tener criterio pero realmente qu criterio tienes si piensas que george bush ha estado en lo cierto en el 90 por ciento de las veces
8806059 no s vosotros pero yo no estoy dispuesto a apostar que la posibilidad de cambio sea del 10 por ciento
8806060 la creencia de que podemos lograr todo lo que nos propongamos es lo que ha caracterizado a este pa s pero ahora esta creencia est en peligro porque estamos en un momento en que estamos en guerra nuestra econom a est agitada y el sue o americano est de nuevo bajo amenaza
8806061 el gobierno no ha sido el causante de todos estos problemas pero el fracaso en afrontarlos s es culpa del gobierno fallido de george w bush y de la pol tica quebrantada que se hace en washington
8806062 estados unidos es mucho mejor que lo que hemos vivido en estos ocho a os somos mucho mejor que todo eso
8806063 nosotros lo medimos por la cantidad de gente que tiene un trabajo que le permite pagar la hipoteca o ahorrar para la educaci n de sus hijos nosotros no lo medimos por el n mero de multimillonarios que hay en nuestro pa s o por los beneficios de nuestras corporaciones
8806064 con el equipamiento adecuado y con las condiciones y beneficios que se merecen
8806065 i speak to you not as a candidate for president but as a citizen a proud citizen of the united states and a fellow citizen of the world
8806066 entiendo que no soy el candidato m s probable para este puesto no encajo en el prototipo habitual y no he pasado mi carrera en los salones de washington
8806067 estoy ante ustedes por que en am rica se est sintiendo algo
8806068 lo que las personas negativas no entienden es que estas elecciones nunca han sido sobre mi son sobre vosotros
8806069 am rica somos mejores que estos ltimos ocho a os
8806070 este momento estas elecciones son nuestra oportunidad para mantener en el siglo xxi la promesa americana con vida
8806071 no es a causa de que a john mccain no le importe es por que john mccain no lo entiende
8806072 la semana que viene en minnesota el mismo partido que les ha tra do dos legislaturas de george bush y dick cheney pedir a este pa s una tercera
8806073 a john mccain le gusta decir que seguir a bin laden hasta las puertas del infierno pero no llegar ni a la cueva donde vive
8806074 que dice acerca de su juicio el que est de acuerdo con bush el 90 por ciento de las veces
8806075 si john mccain quiere tener un debate sobre qui n tiene el temperamento el juicio de servir como el pr ximo comandante en jefe ese es un debate para el que estoy preparado asegur
8806076 somos el partido de roosevelt somos el partido de kennedy as que no me dig is que los dem cratas no defendemos este pa s
8806077 como comandante en jefe nunca vacilar a defender esta naci n pero s lo enviar a nuestras tropas al peligro con una misi n clara y un compromiso sagrado de darles el equipamiento que necesitan en la batalla y el cuidado y las ventajas que merecen cuando vuelven a casa
8806078 terminar la lucha contra al qaeda y los talib n en afganist n
8806079 no se que tipo de vidas cree john mccain que tienen las celebridades pero esa ha sido la m a
8806080 esos son mis h roes sus abuelos esas son las historias que me formaron y por ellos pretendo ganar estas elecciones
8806081 we intend to recognize teacher candidates with abcte certification as we would any other certified teacher candidate
8806082 our selection and hiring process focuses upon finding the most talented teacher for our classroom openings
8806083 what the people heard that day people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8806084 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8806085 five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8806086 stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8806087 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8806088 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8806089 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8806090 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8806091 what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8806092 a lot of people have been saying its very difficult to attack a war hero but barack obama had a go
8806093 he said john mccain didnt know how ordinary americans lived and that he sided with
8806094 when the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 22 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
8806095 paranoico y desconfiado solitario enfermizo asexual y testigo de jehov
8806096 personalidades que han contribuido a hacer un mundo mejor y m s humano
8806097 there are only a few pages left in the book oh no oh no theres only five more pages left this cant be true
8806098 theres magic of all sorts in this tale slights of hand perhaps a bit of real magic
8806099 what did sabine give up all those years to be with a man who couldnt love her the way she loved him
8806100 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8806101 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8806102 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8806103 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8806104 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8806105 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8806106 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8806107 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8806108 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8806109 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8806110 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8806111 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
8806112 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
8806113 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8806114 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8806115 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8806116 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8806117 the next six months are going to tell the story
8806118 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8806119 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8806120 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8806121 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8806122 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8806123 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8806124 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual

8806126 goya no se va a tambalear porque el coloso no sea suyo
8806127 cualquier ni o la puede coger llev rsela a la boca y tener un disgusto deber an pensar que pocos saben que son venenosas son muy llamativas por la flor y la gente las toca con frecuencia
8806128 simplemente van a coger un bal n entre los matojos
8806129 es il gico que parques y jardines no las corte sabiendo que son peligrosos para los ni os es casi imposible controlar que se acerquen
8806130 nos preocupa que no se tomen cartas en el asunto porque si ahora est as con la expo c mo estar cuando pase
8806131 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8806132 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8806133 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8806134 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8806135 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8806136 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8806137 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8806138 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8806139 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8806140 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8806141 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8806142 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8806143 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8806144 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8806145 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8806146 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8806147 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8806148 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8806149 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8806150 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8806151 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8806152 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8806153 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8806154 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8806155 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8806156 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8806157 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8806158 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8806159 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8806160 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8806161 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8806162 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8806163 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8806164 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8806165 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral candidate mccain criticizes senator mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8806166 sir peter has undertaken a critical body of work and has provided the government with a number of key recommendations on how we can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our application of ict to service delivery
8806167 sir peter has conducted an extensive series of consultations with a range of stakeholders from within government the ict industry and related representative organisations
8806168 he has applied his extensive experience obtained in major strategic reviews in the uk with an evidence based approach and has developed a range of robust and achievable recommendations for the australian government
8806169 with sustained leadership and drive at ministerial and top official levels and by providing the enablers of change with the necessary resources not only in funding terms but also skills of the right calibre the australian government through implementing these recommendations can drive significant improvements in its use of ict
8806170 i am confident that the recommended actions and proposed changes can be successfully implemented over the next two to three years and will deliver substantial benefits to the australian government
8806171 dont try to cool off their jets if you cool their jets you are going to cool the hottest thing that has come to nascar in a long long time
8806172 everything is considered cheating now they are taking the outlaw spirit and the innovative spirit out of nascar
8806173 its very fitting that the car is boxy because it is a box that the teams cant get out of
8806174 youve got to spill 100 of your guts and your effort and put everything into nascar
8806175 look at roger penske he has been trying to apply indy car methods to nascar for thirty years he has one daytona 500 win and that was a bit of luck
8806176 newman is leaving him penske for what he feels like is a stronger team
8806177 chip ganassi is going to have to realize that you dont see joe gibbs or rick hendrick off running indy cars and sports cars
8806178 to win in nascar its got to be 100 it has got to be a total effort
8806179 we think its a blow for academic freedom and for universal access to scholarly work said steven schwartz macquaries vice chancellor
8806180 some dont care some have embargo periods some want you to request permission he said
8806181 theyre saying lower it information technology spending is spreading that is evidence of a global slowdown in it spending this certainly isnt good news for tech overall
8806182 dells outlook is for slower spending especially in asia and western europe
8806183 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter
8806184 its a really tough tech market and dell is obviously cutting costs but it wasnt enough to offset the pressure on gross margin
8806185 more than 84 000 people have jammed into invesco field at mile high stadium to hear barack obamas historic acceptance speech
8806186 when i hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business or making her way in the world i think about my grandmother who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman
8806187 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped my life and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8806188 goya no se va a tambalear porque el coloso no sea suyo

8806200 el mundo necesita una nueva mitolog a y esa es la de los superh roes
8806201 ninguno de los personajes puede dejar que sus sentimientos se manifiesten en libertad ni cumplan sus expectativas son amores que tropiezan contra una pared
8806202 i think any time you see something like this occur it is upsetting
8806203 when people have a conflict it can be disconcerting the important thing is that everyone ended up safe
8806204 sometimes the school district does get into the middle of a custody dispute
8806205 it does happen and so often were referring to parenting plans and trying to sort through who goes with who when
8806206 there are going to be signs or symptoms of conflict that youre going to see in your life
8806207 how you feel about that and how you can react to that you want to make sure that they know that theyre safe and theyre okay if they have those feelings its normal and that its okay
8806208 we are calling it stellas just happy to be alive blood drive and i am tickled to death that i get to give blood again
8806209 everyone that does come and give a pint of blood tomorrow will get a free lunch that consists of a hamburger or a cheeseburger french fries and a soda of some kind and dessert
8806210 then inbc people are going to give everyone a free t shirt
8806211 everyone has a possibility unless you have a medical condition to give blood and save somebodys life
8806212 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8806213 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8806214 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8806215 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8806216 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8806217 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8806218 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8806219 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8806220 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8806221 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8806222 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8806223 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8806224 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8806225 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8806226 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8806227 hnlich wie zur zeit stalins will russland nun auch hier und jetzt die vergangenheit des gegners ausl schen
8806228 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8806229 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8806230 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8806231 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8806232 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8806233 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8806234 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8806235 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8806236 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8806237 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8806238 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger
8806239 after they wrecked our economy its time for a change
8806240 after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change
8806241 powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8806242 barack obamas vision and his voice represent the best of america
8806243 it is that common american identity which barack obama exemplifies heart and soul that enables us as americans to speak with moral authority to all of the people of the world
8806244 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8806245 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8806246 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8806247 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8806248 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8806249 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8806250 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8806251 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8806252 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job

8806267 no s qu clase de vida piensa john mccain que tienen las celebridades pero sta es la que he tenido yo

8806277 we have checked 15 000 institutions distributors and retailers and can say affected products are being removed thanks to the heightened public awareness
8806278 we are pleased with this significant and extremely positive development for our company
8806279 we have been anticipating the rems request and have been proactively evaluating a series of options that will enable us to mitigate any delay in approval all other aspects of our onsolis nda were reviewed positively and with no deficiencies noted i want to congratulate the entire team at bdsi for this tremendous accomplishment
8806280 we believe that fda approval of onsolis and its u s commercial launch should add considerable value to bdsi based on the aggregate 30 million in approval and launch milestone payments sales based milestone payments and double digit royalty on sales which provide the means to accelerate development of our pipeline in addition the outcome of the onsolis nda review validates the bema drug delivery platform and should immediately enhance the value of other bema products in development particularly bema buprenorphine our second pain product we believe that the future of bdsi continues to be very promising
8806281 we have been working over the last several months with meda ab our partner for the commercialization of onsolis to prepare for a potential rems requirement these activities have put us in a position to respond rapidly to fdas request depending on fda review time approval could occur as early as the first quarter or as late as second quarter of 2009
8806282 with respect to our financial position we have managed our cash prudently over the course of 2008 and have a few months of cash in reserve
8806283 we have a financial plan that includes several choices to bridge the gap to approval and the receipt of milestone payments from meda totaling 30 million importantly we will seek to only raise the capital required to reach the anticipated approval with little or no dilution to our stockholders it should be noted that the costs associated with finalization and implementation of the rems for onsolis will be the responsibility of meda

8806311 the right to life and absolute respect for it should be the base of our democracy

8806313 we hope that their decision is oriented toward justice the law the truth and the common good

8806319 i doubt if we would ever get the opportunity to show mrs
8806320 a pictures worth a thousand words and she definitely got the message today
8806321 it is important for the obamas to understand the very tragic consequences of their support for abortion we pray that this encounter affects her on a very deep level and gives her more compassion for the innocent lives that are brutally and inhumanely killed by abortion

8806329 my profession has been hijacked i cannot do my job my patients are suffering and i am fed up
8806330 there will be times when it may be necessary for physicians to set aside their personal beliefs
8806331 based on moral or religious belief may constitute professional misconduct
8806332 should not express personal judgments about the beliefs lifestyle identity or characteristics
8806333 to be prepared to set aside their personal beliefs where this is necessary in order to provide care
8806334 you must not express to your patients your personal beliefs including political religious or moral beliefs in ways that exploit their vulnerability or that are likely to cause them distress
8806335 you should not normally discuss your beliefs with patients unless those beliefs are directly relevant to the patients care you must not impose your beliefs on patients or cause distress by the inappropriate or insensitive expression of religious political or other beliefs or views
8806336 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
8806337 a commitment which in its nobility usefulness and ideality is very close to the priests vocation
8806338 you have firsthand experience that in your profession medical care and technical services are not enough even if provided with exemplary professionalism the sick must be helped to regain not only their physical health but also psychological and moral well being this presupposes that the doctor in addition to his professional skill also has an attitude of loving concern inspired by the gospel image of the good samaritan with every suffering person the catholic doctor is called to bear witness to those higher values which have their firmest foundation in faith

8806341 we are recalling the six shortlisted candidates so we can sit and discuss with them these issues especially on the packages because they will have to agree to the package we have to offer given that some of these candidates are very well qualified
8806342 we have the current package of the current ceo who has a couple more days to go and if there has to be a higher salary then we will have to go to the higher salaries commission
8806343 so we have seen two candidates and we will be seeing the rest of them shortly at the moment we have yet to meet the rest because the chairman of the sub committee peceli vocea ps finance is in washington d c on an official trip
8806344 i would like to thank you all for taking up this challenge and i hope that you carry out your duties well
8806345 the outcome could have been influenced by the cheque diplomacy that currently prevails within the forum that aid decides the decision

8806352 it is a strategic partnership with cable and wireless which has great strengths in its international operations

8806360 i pulled down a forty one time around the age of 17 and that was stupid
8806361 they got to the second round of the playoffs last year with mostly sophomores and a freshman quarterback they won their league green meadows conference last year and all those kids are back
8806362 i am most impressed with their defense it speaks a lot for this team
8806363 offensively theyre not great but they are sound willitzer is a solid fullback and they have that veteran quarterback landon drewes
8806364 one thing that will kill any offense ours as well is penetration and pursuit we need to do better at our assignments
8806365 defensively they run the same as you normally see in the wing t sweeps traps counters and play action passing we just have to be aware
8806366 we looked at the films we took out the fine toothed comb and we missed a lot of assignments and werent sound in our techniques
8806367 we had a chance the first half to scored three touchdowns but didnt still we scored 13 points what i liked a lot was how we stayed aggressive and played hard all night i felt our conditioning paid off
8806368 we never punted they punted four times we outgained them 312 228 and lost we gave up four big plays two passes their only completions for 100 yards and two runs that accounted for 178 yards
8806369 defense has been the standard bearer for me the last 11 years when weve been a good football team we played very good defense outside of four plays we shut them down
8806370 it came down to our offense being unable to convert a 4th and 1 early and a 4th and 5 on our last drive
8806371 i dont care that st johns went 2 8 past year they are still one of the three top teams in the mac they never lack for talent and they dont this year
8806372 they are extremely well coached remember they were state champs in 2005
8806373 everyone knows how good the mac is it is the best small school conference in ohio period we are 2 15 against liberty center but i have no doubt this will be our toughest game all season well find out how good we are and how high we can pick up our level of play
8806374 dr kings speech was for the oppressed obamas speech is the american dream come true

8806376 wed be crossing the mason dixon line and my mother would say ok no water no going to the bathroom until we get to grandmas house
8806377 we started this months ago and now i cant believe the time is really here
8806378 not that many years ago neither of the top two candidates hillary rodham clinton or obama could have voted they couldnt even have been seen together how do you explain it
8806379 this time im going to vote for a president who puts barney smith first over smith barney
8806380 when we talked about an open convention this was what democrats meant
8806381 the value proposition is that it provides both business and consumers with cost savings with international calls as well as todays expensive roaming costs our software illustrates how much can be done using voice and messaging capabilities
8806382 when it comes to avoiding roaming costs the savings is even greater near 50 to 70 percent especially for those traveling internationally
8806383 hey wait that girl looks kinda familiar wait thats my daughter

8806385 what is the one secret that your husband told you not to tell anybody
8806386 i dont believe were in a financial position to even entertain an idea like that
8806387 i dont think we should be talking to the extent of committing village dollars
8806388 this purchase will add nothing to the communities along this line there is no benefit which will accrue to our community only problems
8806389 we have no intention to be enslaved by a railroad
8806390 i dont want anyone to have this in their backyard
8806391 were here to represent our ancestors yes indeedy every one of them
8806392 i must have spent 400 on buttons and shirts everybody says bring me something back but its not a problem i understand what theyre feeling
8806393 we already have our airline tickets to d c for the inaugural
8806394 i would like to see a qualified negro as president of the united states
8806395 but i suspect that even if this were today possible the necessities of the office would shape his actions far more than his racial identity
8806396 my first grandbaby is going to turn 1 on saturday
8806397 and for me this day represents new possibilities for her i want things for her to be different i dont want her to get paid 75 cents on the dollar like we are

8806402 we are confronted with a moral issue it is as old as the scriptures and is as clear as the american constitution now the time has come for this nation to fulfill its promise
8806403 now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of gods children now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood
8806404 we can never be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote no no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream
8806405 go back to mississippi go back to alabama go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed let us not wallow in the valley of despair at the moment i still have a dream it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream
8806406 the big shock came to us when we returned home
8806407 how many years can some people exist before theyre allowed to be free how many times can a man turn his head and pretend that he just doesnt see
8806408 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
8806409 we share the same beliefs although hes so left of me that i call him mr pinko and theres something about his gruffness and my voice that gels
8806410 steve earle wrote a song for me called i am a wanderer that expresses a sentiment i relate to far better than anything i could write
8806411 for years i chose not to engage in party politics at this time however changing that posture feels like the responsible thing to do
8806412 after 9 11 nobody wanted to hear anything bad about america
8806413 nobody loves a war better than the president and a few years ago it got to the point where if i said anything i truly believed about the iraq war or global warming during a concert people would get up and leave thats fine with me actually its a badge of honour
8806414 little by little it became clear that bush was bizarre and dangerous
8806415 i would do concerts where i would see people in the audience sitting with their arms crossed looking angry as i said i was right 40 years ago and i am right now and throw my fist in the air now theyre listening bushs great trick is to suggest that to go against him is to be unpatriotic slowly people realised that
8806416 i represent so much before ive even opened my mouth but i was more active when i was young and its only now that im spending time with my family
8806417 i live with my mother who is 95 i have a four year old grandchild and its a turning for me its confusing too am i really allowed to hang around the home and look after my mom
8806418 i dont regret what i did in the sixties but you cant stay on the biting edge of radicalism all your life my core beliefs of non violence havent changed but my lifestyle has
8806419 the vietnamese developed all sorts of neuroses and phobias after the war ended because they were no longer spending every day in the heightened state that comes with not knowing if youre going to be killed or not when the war ended a lot of us lost direction i certainly did
8806420 i had this great fear of going commercial as a result of becoming well known at such a young age i was afraid of the wider world but i did also have deeply held beliefs that i clung on to tenaciously the big event was meeting martin luther king in 1956 at a quaker seminar that pretty much shaped the direction my life took
8806421 they laughed all the time and told racist jokes about themselves and i realised that nobody could see that side of them they had to be seen as serious and i related to that we got to a restaurant and i asked them dont you have a big march to organise they said we just have you get a public image that you have to live up to but your private reality is often very different
8806422 at times of great uncertainty music and politics are fused
8806423 i would never have sung we shall overcome to an american audience during the eighties because it would have been a nostalgia trip now its appropriate again because its relevant im happiest when that happens
8806424 mir bedeutet ein 40 prozentiger anstieg in der entwaldung rein gar nichts und ich habe nicht die geringsten schuldgef hle bei dem was wir tun wir sprechen ber eine fl che gr er als europa die kaum ber hrt ist deshalb gibt es nichts ber das man sich sorgen machen m sste

8806426 estamos muy satisfechos con estos resultados del primer semestre en vista de los dif ciles tiempos que atraviesa actualmente el sector de aerol neas por el tremendo incremento de los costes de combustible

8806431 a n quedan partes del plan que se deben concretar
8806432 lo nico que queda por hacer por nuestra parte es esperar a la pr xima asamblea y estudiar la propuesta que nos han presentado para luego tomar una decisi n firme
8806433 la debilidad del primer semestre demuestra las dificil simas condiciones del mercado con costes de combustible sin precedentes con la ralentizaci n de nuestro crecimiento econ mico en nuestros principales mercados y con la devaluaci n del d lar y la libra esterlina
8806434 incluso con la bajada del precio del combustible en las ltimas semanas a adi todav a se notar cierta presi n competitiva sobre las tarifas a reas y aunque lleguemos a equilibrar las cuentas en el segundo semestre tendremos p rdidas al final del a o

8806439 well thanks to the lame ass security im going home
8806440 it was at the start of a tour that was headed by the walker brothers and engelbert humperdinck
8806441 they were all very unlikely bedfellows it was the opening night of the tour nothing out of the ordinary except for the burning of the guitar

8806443 they said they were going to burn it so i nipped round the corner to buy some ronson lighter fuel it sounds ludicrous but they were fairly ludicrous days things were done on the spur of the moment we did lots of crazy things back then

8806473 i think we have successfully one upped these democrat wannabes
8806474 our columns are the genuine article borrowed from the temple of zeus in greece not just plywood mockups as opposed to democrats we republicans have a sense of history the iraq war and hurricane katrina have transformed empire america our columns are a nod towards george w bushs authentic place in history and john mccains commitment to continue the tradition
8806475 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8806476 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time
8806477 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 of the time

8806479 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back

8806481 my job is to make sure i can go hard and make sure my blockers dont have to stay on the blocks long i really give credit to my blockers theyve given me some nice holes
8806482 courtney has been dynamic on the returns and has done a good job
8806483 he also has given us great coverage work as a gunner on punts and kickoff coverage hes doing an excellent job
8806484 weve got a lot of options were really going to wait and see how long jeff is going to be before we really finalize those things we have some veteran guys who can play in there
8806485 it kind of reminded me of college not really rotating just staying out there the whole game and really playing center instead of playing guard and center with all the injuries weve gotten you never know when your number is going to be called you have to be prepared you have to be ready every single day every single down we dont know whos going to be the starting center so were coming in this week prepared for anything
8806486 weve done everything at night we really dont have a 1 p m game for a while weve got the night game we have a 4 oclock game weve seen it with the roof opened and closed so i think weve done what we needed to do
8806487 he would have to have a dramatic setback right now every step weve taken has been good he did a little bit on tuesday he did a lot more close to his regular workload on wednesday
8806488 he warmed up today and felt good so id be very very surprised if hes not ready to go
8806489 what he wanted to do was really kind of simulate what he wanted to do on game day and see how everything felt and if he wanted to alter his routine for next sunday
8806490 i think he came away feeling pretty good about it he wanted to see how loose hed be after the wait in the locker room and that type of thing
8806491 we had an exercise bike out there for him but i think hes pretty happy with the way his routine went
8806492 it was one of those fifth preseason games that wasnt artistic
8806493 im sure the fans didnt appreciate a lot of the things that happened out there but we got to see some things we need to see and made some progress in some areas we got to see the players in situations we wanted to see them in now head to the process of making our roster decisions
8806494 they have some pluses well evaluate how everything is how peyton is how jim is and evaluate how many quarterbacks were going to keep
8806495 they havent told us anything ill guess well find out saturday about 6 oclock if weve gotten the call or havent gotten the call
8806496 i told our players it will be totally different i think were all looking forward to it
8806497 all in all i thought we got some things done in this preseason that were good for us and that will help us down the road

8806524 it could have been anything an apple banana crackers it could have happened at home
8806525 we knew that he was going to be brain damaged but didnt the know the extent but we really didnt care as long as he could enjoy part of his life then we were told on sunday that he wasnt going to make it

8806543 tavitas a lot better in year two in the system than he was in year one
8806544 i expect him to be even better a month from now four months from now and a year from now tavita has an excellent grasp of the offense
8806545 the number one thing you would have to say is the difference in lyle from this year to last year is confidence
8806546 that then relates right into speed of play and decision making understanding and the ability to take something that has happened and transform it into a positive
8806547 ever since we found out he was granted his redshirt year weve been doing great things
8806548 hes been able to help me help him out and the rest of the offense hes doing a great job of being one of the leaders out there and having him back in the offense is something special

8806581 i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that
8806582 i believe in his mccain ideals and his proposals to lead this nation hes been a fighter for the hispanic community
8806583 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that daddy yankee and mccain
8806584 the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him

8806592 we are working in close partnership with the appropriate levels of government and stakeholders to ensure that collectively were appropriately prepared
8806593 we have swarms of activity in this area every once in a while
8806594 some hours we have an earthquake every minute or two other hours we are not quite so busy
8806595 ive spoken to ian and i dont buy that comment
8806596 ive heard nothing from nick i have not been given any indication which direction hes going with his picks i have no clue what hes doing to do
8806597 its a difficult situation because if he was playing gleneagles this week he would basically give up his chance of winning the fedex cup
8806598 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8806599 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8806600 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8806601 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8806602 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8806603 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8806604 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8806605 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8806606 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two

8806638 sally was better known in chapel hill than i was when we met
8806639 i think the word is patience a lot of times that comes with age mack as all young coaches are was in a hurry he wanted the success right now but you have to temper it and he was able to do that more and more
8806640 mack understood it would take time to build north carolina because of where the talent was when he took over
8806641 but emotionally it was difficult to have the patience especially when you start off 1 10 and 1 10 when sally came in and really stabilized his personal life that just added to it that much more
8806642 sally has had her own successes and a lot of aspects of success are transferable she figured out very quickly what macks world is all about mack understood early on sally had experiences that were transferable to his world its obvious that sallys presence in macks life has been very significant in the people aspects of it the organizational aspects and the security aspect of it they are a team a partnership

8806645 we talk about our secondary but earl thomas has been around a long time
8806646 christian scott has been around a long time blake gideon went through 15 spring practices before he went through the 29 in fall camp so its not like those guys are walking in here as true freshmen and then chykie brown deon beasley ryan palmer and curtis brown have been here for a couple years were not as green back there as it sounds like we are
8806647 were excited those guys are going to play well for us
8806648 thats really not my job to sit here and split them up and label them for everybody we know what they do best and well use them accordingly
8806649 i dont think anyone has ever deserved to have their jersey retired more than vince young with what he accomplished at this school
8806650 he put us back on the modern map theres some people who thought we would never win a national championship now because of he and the other guys he played with we have a chance to win another one
8806651 usc dont know how many guys we have who are gangster
8806652 it excites me as a coach to have three backs who are hungry to play
8806653 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love but one day all of a sudden it just happened
8806654 i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing but it was just the best way to go
8806655 i made sure he was naked when they took him because i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8806656 still we have to worry about the hurricanes effect on this market
8806657 the decision to deliver aid using nato battleships is something that hardly can be explained
8806658 i made clear above all that i would have expected that we would talk about these questions in international organisations before unilateral recognition happened
8806659 there are several un security council resolutions in which the territorial integrity of georgia was stressed which russia also worked on
8806660 we cannot accept these violations of international law of a territory by the army of a neighbouring country
8806661 my country will extend the arm of cooperation and friendship to ease the transition period for south ossetia
8806662 it was good for us to go down and score
8806663 we needed that after last week were not a bad offense we werent down on ourselves we came out here and gave ourselves a little bit of confidence
8806664 we didnt play that well last week we played a little tight early but offensively i thought we did some good things tonight i thought our defense played well we got a turnover and we scored off a turnover
8806665 it creates more traffic because it keeps trucks in the right hand lane when all the merging traffic is going on all the time
8806666 what we would prefer is to encourage safe driving and to enforce laws already on the books to keep slower traffic to the right
8806667 he understood that to truly fulfill our national dream we must accept the challenges and seize the opportunities presented by our north
8806668 as prime minister diefenbaker said as he stood here in 1961 there is a new world emerging above the arctic circle
8806669 i dont know if he the driver fell asleep but there were no brakes
8806670 brought up in a dysfunctional home marked with physical abuse neglect abandonment and sexual abuse
8806671 there are certainly known associates locations that the escapees frequented family members being contacted in an attempt to determine whereabouts of the escaped inmates
8806672 with a slight fear of being tackled by police i hopped on the highest counter i could see and shouted out the news
8806673 i asked for their attention and belted it out in my best theatrical voice i told them they were all famous they were being reported on the news we came out and the media was waiting for us so they knew everybody but us knew
8806674 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8806675 even as late as wednesday we had secured a new investment package but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8806676 ive been living here for seven years and this was my moving back to canada day
8806677 that was a lot of drama in itself and now im having to wait for this its not exactly fun
8806678 we knew that they were in administration protection but on that basis as far as we were aware from our legal advice the aircraft could operate
8806679 it started with a gas smell and they replaced the line and now we have this
8806680 i got a jackhammer and dug it out myself my wife my brother and my sister in law weve got 236 hours tied up in digging
8806681 they said you have to prove to us before well dig there
8806682 the city sent a crew out with a camera thats when we found there was a gas line through the sewer line
8806683 what really bothered me the most was when i talked to vincent at gallager and bassett
8806684 its like this has gone from ridiculous to the sublime
8806685 the person depicted in the crime being committed on video wasnt either one of the two people we had
8806686 she was inside the store committing another crime identical to what she had done in amherst
8806687 my understanding is that some if not all of the original charges are going to be withdrawn and they will place some new charges in the file
8806688 they didnt share their reasoning with us but it seems to me that the logical reason would be that there was not enough evidence for these charges to exist as a felony and that certainly a felony couldnt be proven in this case which is what weve been saying all along
8806689 inserting a foreign object into the rectum of a male while he was being held down on the floor of the school bus
8806690 one of the elements of aggravated sex abuse is penetration
8806691 we had volumes of information that there was no penetration so thats one element thats gone
8806692 would make it a little more factually unbelievable that the penetration did occur
8806693 i think the case got blown out of proportion long before it ever got to the district attorneys office to be thoroughly investigated
8806694 what the source was for that inflation of the truth i cant tell you for sure
8806695 there was some conduct that was certainly not appropriate but you know boys will be boys and i hate to say that because of the level that this was charged but at the same time the facts are the facts
8806696 its not something that these boys should be labeled criminals for
8806697 everything weve seen so far points away from the felony charge its a real shame to charge that level of crime before theres even a scintilla of evidence that can sustain the charge
8806698 you cant take away the fact that theyve been charged with aggravated sexual abuse in the third degree
8806699 that charge is going to show up on profiles throughout the rest of their lives so its very unfortunate they have 50 years forward that theyre gonna have to explain that
8806700 its a nice school system its a nice place to live
8806701 i think not just for these three young men that are charged but for the whole community some closure to this case and to go back to living their lives would be beneficial for everybody
8806702 we want to hold your careers up as models to show our current students what kind of success is possible through hard work and perseverance
8806703 i took the teachers here for granted i think but now looking back i realize some of them really stood out
8806704 the subjects the curriculum all the things we did here were important
8806705 but in many ways they were only a vehicle to build character and values
8806706 lockport high school gave me my sisters and my brothers our educational foundation this is where it all started
8806707 this family values education values lockport high school and all it has given and blessed us with
8806708 i was proud of that answer and i remain proud and grateful to my parents for helping to make that happen

8806728 who can enjoy the greatest number of sexual couplings this weekend
8806729 would you pay to see diesel as a marvel villain
8806730 you look at these and try to figure out what happened whats causing them
8806731 el conflicto habido este mes de agosto ha sido minuciosamente orquestado desde mosc con el fin de amputar a georgia estos dos territorios
8806732 una represalia anunciada a costa de la independencia de kosovo

8806738 we believe that the 12 executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilize the state
8806739 just to throw him right back in there after two days i dont think its fair to him either
8806740 i figure ill give him another day to let him get some more bp and well go from there it might not be fair to throw him back in there on friday well see
8806741 we said we believe we can get to 18 million based on what we have going on with our ticket model and our sponsorship and our other commitments
8806742 many of us have done this we worked the economics inside and out and were confident
8806743 and the connections at all levels this time were unbelievable there are major junior teams in each city now but the overall business plan was at another level
8806744 in some respects calgary is taking a chance because were getting all the team canada pool games
8806745 i cant imagine under what bizarre circumstances canada isnt going to make it into the medal round but there is always that risk i think it was a good compromise
8806746 the other thing is calgarys building is bigger and probably better located to get more albertans to the final game medicine hat lethbridge red deer where there are other junior hockey franchises we thought that might have been another deciding factor
8806747 yeah you miss out on one or two big games you get to see the journey its about winning at the end yes but every journey is different
8806748 that event set the bar by the year 2012 alberta will have raised that bar considerably
8806749 i dont think the nhl teams are going to realize anything financial other than help develop a future fan base
8806750 hockey alberta is going to have a legacy piece on this theyre going to obviously get some money hockey canada gets half of that net guarantee the iihf gets money all the way round it has become a great engine of funding for junior hockey
8806751 we havent slammed the gavel on that the saskatchewan roughriders head coach said when asked if michael bishop will start
8806752 i have to keep in mind the overall team and what the expectations are miller said
8806753 we are a performance and production based team and we have to get into a winning situation here
8806754 he has even brought a couple of suggestions about things he wanted us to tweak for him miller said
8806755 he has put in extra hours beyond what we ask all of our quarterbacks to do
8806756 i just have to keep getting my reps and hope that i get the opportunity bishop said
8806757 he produced really well last year but this year he hasnt performed at the same level miller said
8806758 we have the possibility of bringing in more receivers and we have already brought in gerran walker miller said
8806759 foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory with id
8806760 accepting for the sake of argument its proponents as well as defendants argument that to introduce id to students will encourage critical thinking it still has utterly no place in a science curriculum
8806761 the purpose prong of the lemon test asks whether governments actual purpose is to endorse or disapprove of religion
8806762 even if it is motivated in part by a religious purpose
8806763 the expression accepting for the sake of argument normally means that a position about something has been stated and an exception to that position is being made for the sake of argument
8806764 accepting for the sake of argument that larry does in fact understand biology he still appears not to be capable of critical thinking or thinking at all
8806765 about 50 of an inspectors time is on the floor of the plant
8806766 the other 50 is overseeing paperwork most of it scientific in nature test results and the like
8806767 ultimately any effective regulation is in a sense a joint responsibility weve increased the number of regulators but we also do rely obviously on the work done within the companies themselves
8806768 i absolutely do not believe this is a failure of the canadian food safety system or the regulators certainly knowing theres a desire to assign blame i want to reiterate that the buck stops right here
8806769 in a culture of food safety we have an unwavering commitment to keep our food safe and we have an excellent system and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed
8806770 we found out when the lab work started coming back that she died from listeriosis
8806771 by friday evening she was making sounds at that point and then became unconscious after that
8806772 by monday morning we knew it was serious and we know that they were putting antibiotics in her just as fast as they could but they couldnt get the temperature down she wasnt improving it was looking pretty bad
8806773 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8806774 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8806775 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
8806776 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
8806777 monsters do exist in us and among us they walk in our shadow they can prey on us more as we fear them less we should know we created them
8806778 so the set reinforces that hes no ordinary politician but a celebrity instead and like most celebrities having delusions of being more than just an actor playing a part a singer entertaining a crowd
8806779 theres a fine line between indignant and angry and obama is swerving back and forth all over it missing the soaring rhetoric
8806780 nothings been announced but i wouldnt be surprised if theres a third particulary on the heels of hellboy iis success
8806781 and i know guillermo has an incredibly well articulated idea about what the third movie needs to be itll answer a lot of questions it almost needs to happen because with the ideas that he has abou closing the trilogy it would be a shame for it go unfinished

8806784 t here would have been an unbroken line from the 1983 beirut bombings to 9 11 and no way for bush to withstand what would have been blistering critiques from the democrats
8806785 gossip is a greasy currency trading in it can leave one feeling a little unctuous
8806786 the downside of the lowdown is that you traffic in an awful lot of bad news
8806787 at least thats how i came to feel i began empathizing with the victims and consequences and who needs a gossip columnist like that
8806788 dont they want to tell their side wouldnt they rather have it here than somewhere that would start out with a point of view
8806789 the latter comes with special features about the films robot heroes including web vignettes and an interactive storybook and a detailed documentary on pixar
8806790 all the odds are on the man who is intrinsically the most devious and mediocre the man who can most easily and adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum the presidency tends year by year to go to such men as democracy is perfected the office represents more closely the inner soul of the people we move toward a lofty ideal on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
8806791 what did my little child do to deserve this torture
8806792 suddenly i felt somebody stumble against my bed i saw a person wearing jeans and tshirt run away i ran after him but left the chase thinking he could not be a thief as there is hardly anything worth stealing in my house when i came back i saw my daughter whimpering and covered in mud and blood
8806793 the walls of her vagina and anus had bad tears since passing stool and urine were extremely painful we have created a bypass route after she becomes a little comfortable we will operate to take care of the tears

8806795 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities
8806796 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8806797 the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8806798 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8806799 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8806800 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational

8806852 o fato que barack obama ainda n o est pronto para ser presidente
8806853 barack obama is ready to fight his way to the white house

8806920 aaron threw a perfect ball in the hole and the safety came down for the interception instead of playing the ball and it worked out in our favor
8806921 it would have been nice to get them a little more work but we were just being smart health is our number one priority
8806922 we had a good performance last week one and done this week
8806923 hes just got a bruise he really could have finished
8806924 were disappointed that we couldnt get the ball in the end zone but sometimes when you play a preseason opponent in the regular season youre going to be selective about what youre doing as they were
8806925 its not about making a statement but i did feel like i did what i had to do
8806926 i think both our young quarterbacks were in some tough spots
8806927 they kept battling they did some good things it takes time to develop young quarterbacks and thats where we are im excited about their future but weve got work to do
8806928 i thought i did a good job of escaping the pocket making something happen when nothing was really there
8806929 i thought he went up and made a great catch but obviously the defender knocked it away i thought i showed i could make a play out of the pocket though
8806930 you have to be going fast but you have to be under control ive had a lot of experience at it in the past last year at lsu we had a lot of games in the fourth quarter a lot of games came down to the last drive fourth downs everything like that
8806931 walking off the field tonight i feel that they both did a number of positive things
8806932 i think theres things they can learn from theres mistakes they made they can learn from i think they played to the speed of the game as they did the past three games
8806933 but its a process its not about one game its not about one day its a process to get the young quarterbacks ready to play and develop at the same time its a challenge
8806934 i thought we kept playing and we came back and got a shot to win the game at the end
8806935 nobody really got their heads down we knew we had our 2s in versus their 1s and it was a challenge for us
8806936 i know we are probably going to keep six but im not sure all i know is that i played my butt off i practiced my butt off and i put my best foot forward whatever happens ill live with it
8806937 i have improved every year and i learned the defense
8806938 i know how to play both sides and i felt like i played these last four games real well with hardly any mistakes basically its up to them

8806942 you know what a lot of these guys must be feeling right now
8806943 when i jumped up i came down and i was just a little bit off balance
8806944 i looked up and saw a guy right in my face and knew i couldnt get the punt off initially i thought i could make a move and try to punt the ball but once i made the move it was open so i just took off
8806945 quarterbacks go out of bounds i just cut back and put two hands on the ball and wanted to see if i could find anything else

8806981 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8806982 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class

8806991 h aving a section dedicated solely to glbt will be a big problem for many of our folks
8806992 weve got more than 200 listings of other clubs and music venues and restaurants and so forth
8806993 theyre throwing away a lot of good information they couldve used
8806994 the lt governor was not aware of the decision and has not even seen the guidebooks

8806997 if we look at your average medieval town or your average greek polis most are about the scale of those we find in this part of the amazon
8806998 only the ones we find are much more complicated in terms of their planning
8806999 some of the practices that these folks hammered may provide alternative forms of understanding how to do low level sustainable development today
8807000 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8807001 if you find it in europe its a city if you find it somewhere else it has to be something else

8807009 to some wary adults shes in a world where she doesnt belong unlike a typical social network page a blog can be seen by anyone and at least one young fashion blogger says shes been recognized by strangers on the street a worrisome turn for adults worried about privacy and predators
8807010 blogging is vanity like loving the smell of your own farts like not only tasting your menstrual blood but making bloody thumbprints and buying gold leafed frames in which to display them
8807011 if it werent enough that she calls out snoop doggy dog in the same paragraph that she drops margiela diy shes wanting a fringed vest and listening to feist
8807012 it is true that the quality of style rookie is better than youd expect but coen underestimates the power of children to immerse themselves in a subject they love

8807051 we found no difference in the proportion of stems twining clockwise versus anticlockwise between the hemispheres
8807052 ninety two per cent of the stems we recorded twined in an anticlockwise direction
8807053 we are now investigating the possibility that the widespread phenomenon of anticlockwise twining arises as a function of the left handed bias of all biological molecules on earth
8807054 all natural proteins on earth are left handed molecules with a tendency to twist in one direction
8807055 in plants the cell skeletons are made of proteins if the proteins have a tendency to twist to the left so might the plant stems
8807056 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8807057 they have quite remarkable planning and self organisation more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
8807058 it is very different from what we might expect using certain classic models of urbanism
8807059 the whole landscape is almost like a latticework the way it is gridded off
8807060 the individual centers themselves are much less constructed it is more patterned at the regional level
8807061 these are far more planned at the regional level than your average medieval town
8807062 here things are oriented at the same angles and distances across the entire landscape
8807063 if he knew about xingu it would have been a chapter in his book
8807064 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
8807065 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous
8807066 for the first time we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non humans this is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language based on 1993 monograph language comprehension in ape and child
8807067 this is a long term project starting from the beginning of where we have data
8807068 all of this is contextualized with our current research and larger programs such as forgiveness research the students are looking at the earlier data while investigators are looking at new data
8807069 this paper serves as an investigation into the early ontogeny of these kinds of competencies
8807070 these papers will eventually be assembled in a larger volume to look at issues in the development of forgiveness and other cultural dimensions of the apes lives
8807071 she was using language to get at what she wanted
8807072 she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanishas knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8807073 one of the things janni has affirmed and affirmed in a way the lay person can understand is the aspect of turn taking if there is anything universal in human language its turn of talk
8807074 the fact that panbanisha has done this and its accessible even to an untrained reviewer i think is an important aspect of her paper she has looked at the whole social action and the meaning ideational flow going back and forth is obvious
8807075 originally repetition was thought of something that happens normally in human language
8807076 traditionally repetition in ape communicative behaviors is assumed to be proof that they dont have language its a kind of dichotomy or unfairness
8807077 hers will be the first ph d produced in ape language since the research moved to iowa
8807078 janni is an important part of the future and she will help carry ape language research further

8807127 this is from an outfit that claimed the election of the rudd government would turn australia from a flintstones era into a jetsons era overnight when neither of those claims are true
8807128 were seeing broken promises racked up on broadband and no improvement in service availability
8807129 we have embarked on such a significant national project here involving potentially billions of dollars of public funds
8807130 we will therefore go through the most rigorous comprehensive public tender process to ensure probity is honoured so we can get on with the business of laying out and rolling out this network
8807131 we are committed to a digital revolution in australia we are committed to a digital education revolution in australia
8807132 its the pathway to the future and were confident in the progress weve made
8807133 earlier this year the shadow minister criticised the timeframes as being unrealistic and dangerously truncated for no apparent reason
8807134 now he criticises the government for taking the time to ensure proponents have the information to prepare robust proposals
8807135 they get you in with those sale prices and expect you to buy everything else and be done with it all at once not me
8807136 this is bringing it down to 89 cents and i have a manufacturers coupon for 50 cents for each box and itll bring it down to 39 cents
8807137 we can pick up two of them and our bill can come pretty close to zero
8807138 and i know im going to get my moneys worth out of them
8807139 i would buy it for 3 50 if it was in my size
8807140 i am a very intelligent person i have a ph d that i did not buy
8807141 going out on the opening drive and scoring a touchdown is the way you want to start any game
8807142 it was a great job by david carr coming in and leading the offense it was a good start gives us a little momentum and a little confidence boost so were excited about starting the season
8807143 we had a good performance last week one and done this week
8807144 those whose palm kernels have been cracked by the benevolent spirit should not forget to be humble
8807145 i am a very intelligent person i have a phd that i did not buy
8807146 paying 10 million naira for a table at a concert
8807147 we are alive and thats what matters most many people that went to the battle field did not come out alive some were blown to pieces and never made it but even as we are sitting here day after day trying to make ends meet through the benevolence of kind nigerians we are consoled by the fact that we wake up everyday to fend for ourselves through this means
8807148 i was recruited into the biafran army at umuna training depot and was posted to the 9th battalion from there i went to umuahia to be the special guard to our then head of state gen odumegwu ojukwu in december 1968 there was too much bombing at umuahia so we were drafted down to the 14th division in the aba area
8807149 we volunteered to fight the war because of the atrocities we saw with our very eyes been done to our people no one forced me into the army any youngman in
8807150 i was in the infantry division and wanted to go into the battle nobody was thinking about the future the present them gave no hope for what was to come as all we wanted was to defend ourselves i enlisted into the army after i saw our people being brought back from the north igbo people and they were indifferent conditions of pain agony and death everything they ever laboured for was gone some of the survivors told us of how anything igbo was being killed kids as young as five years were murdered in broad day light that was enough reason for me to join the army of liberation for ndi igbo
8807151 we had nothing to start with we fought with little arms and ammunition and it still baffles me how we survived for so long i believe god was on our side otherwise we would have been overrun by the enemies a long time before the war ended there was a time we fought with our hands
8807152 at abala in the azumini sector i was shot in a gun battle between us and the enemies
8807153 the reason we fought was not because we were strong or powerful we fought to defend ourselves and should the situation repeat itself we will defend ourselves because the people we fought against them came with a mission to annihilate us that gave us no chances at all than to take up arms
8807154 we fought for the right cause because we did not plan for the war it was imposed on us you will not be in your home knowing that somebody wants to eliminate you and you wouldnt fight back
8807155 nobody will stay and see his head of state captured or killed if that happens that means the whole cause for which we fought failed
8807156 i feel 100 per cent betrayed by that they should have a rethink and know what went wrong i believe some people dont want the real intentions to be carried out
8807157 we know that ojukwu and others were serving in the nigerian army before the onset of the war and we are happy he was called back but then what about us that were lured into the war we should also be compensated in one way or the other the fg should pay us also
8807158 the no victor no vanquished proclamation should have guided the government the way okeke was treated okafor should benefit too this selective payment of ex nigerian army officers is not good after all we were all soldiers
8807159 they are the one that are supposed to have taken up our case especially our former commander in chief col ojukwu
8807160 whatever ojukwu says about us will be taken seriously but it is unfortunate that it went the way it did we have resigned ourselves to fate we fought as soldiers but have now been abandoned if he wants to help us we will be happy and appeased but if they keep on turning deaf ears to our pleas we cant do anything than wait for the day death will come calling
8807161 we are always here and see them passing with their convoy and they dont look at us they were children when we were in battle to save them from being annihilated but today we cant even attract their sympathy let them know that the god of the igbos is watching
8807162 we initially thought a greater number of vehicles would be sold
8807163 the economic environment the crude oil price and the raw material cost trends were not accurately forecast
8807164 we consider electric vehicles as one of the candidates for sustainable mobility but for the time being the most realistic approach is to use the electric vehicle for short distance travel
8807165 in the u s it is unlikely for the economy to remain stagnant for long
8807166 will increasingly rely on emerging markets as mature regions such as western europe japan and north america reach saturation
8807167 air pollution is estimated to cause approximately two million premature deaths worldwide
8807168 hundreds of papers on both the causal link and the question of sensitivity
8807169 and the colors the colors of that beautiful fabric i have never seen anything like it in my life
8807170 the boy is right the emperor is naked its true
8807171 however it is clear from the discussion section within the paper that mr callendars findings were not peer reviewed and furthermore not accepted by his colleagues indeed the following comments are included as part of the discussion within that paper which is presented as a reading followed by discussion pg 237 1 the numerical results could not be used to give an indication of the order of magnitude of the effect of carbon dioxide and 2 it is not clear how absorption energy by carbon dioxide is calculated these are important points that the callendar paper explains have not been properly examined
8807172 he felt that the actual numerical results which mr callendar had obtained could not be used to give a definite indication of the order of magnitude of the effect
8807173 as stated in the paper the variation of temperature with co2 fig
8807174 2 what you dr marohasy write about global warming is not currently accepted by a majority of your colleagues for example csiro or barry brook
8807175 carbon dioxide is the major greenhouse gas in anthropogenic emissions
8807176 i wonder if the world will be able to stand the shock if agw is disproved
8807177 his main contribution to knowledge was propounding the theory that linked rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere to global temperature
8807178 i do not think the definition of causal link needs definition to rational people
8807179 it has been 50 billion dollars and no evidence is pretty much a falsification sometimes i use understatement for effect
8807180 it would appear jennifer that youre not looking for papers which establish a causal link between aco2 and gw and reading what they have to say
8807181 it is apparent however that a body of science published in peer review journals establishing a causal link between anthropogenic carbon dioxide and warming and quantifying the extent of this warming is lacking but would be expected to exist to support popular agw theory
8807182 most of the observed warming over the past fifty years is anthropogenic
8807183 anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases will lead to significant global warming
8807184 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas doubling its concentration will warm global climate in equilibrium by 3 c 1 5 c
8807185 for a start it could avoid confusion between birds ludicrous empiricism on stilts and what is actually possible
8807186 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
8807187 a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8807188 aggressive sri lankan government forces continue to push deeper into the tamil tiger heartland and are now within reach of their administrative capital raising hopes that the end of a brutal 25 year civil war may be near
8807189 whatever the future may hold there is no denying that as far as ongoing positional warfare is concerned it is a case of advantage army and that the ltte liberation tigers of tamil eelam is being relentlessly forced to fall back from previously held positions
8807190 clashes have intensified as the army moves to cut off a vital sea smuggling route from india while thrusting into the eastern flank in an effort to surround kilinochchi
8807191 there is no turning back under any circumstances or influence now until every inch of land is recaptured and each and every terrorist is killed or captured
8807192 on sunday mr rajapakses party won elections for two provincial councils which he argued amounted to a referendum on his governments military strategy
8807193 meanwhile aid agencies working in the north say the 112 000 ethnic tamils who have fled their homes to escape mounting violence over the past two months are forced to stay on the move to avoid daily gun battles shelling and air attacks
8807194 the overall total of displaced in rebel held areas stands at 145 000 but could soar above 200 000 according to the united nations which said last week that relief supplies are running
8807195 despite repeated assurances endless complication resulted in the party being turned back from ratmalana airport destroying months of preparation time and expense
8807196 they the braves arent coming back next year are they dad
8807197 if my character and temperament to be president are what john mccain is talking about all the time i want him to bring it on i will debate him any day
8807198 a leader who can deliver change is what we need the change that everybody knows we need
8807199 tonight we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation not because of the height of our skyscrapers or the power of our military or the size of our economy
8807200 we hold these truths to he self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed with certain inalienable rights among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
8807201 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8807202 albertas global reputation for nanotechnology research just became enhanced as we will now be recognized as a place for putting that technology on the store shelves and into peoples lives
8807203 this new centre the first of its kind in canada will give entrepreneurs a place to turn ideas into viable market ready products
8807204 the launch of acamp helps position western canada at the forefront of innovation and is an important milestone in albertas growing capacity for science and technology commercialization
8807205 in concordance with the canadas science and technology strategy mobilizing science and technology to canadas advantage our government is proud to contribute 3 5 million through its western diversification program to help alberta become a centre for nanotechnology development and production
8807206 its incredible the number of emerging technology companies in alberta with the potential to develop exciting new consumer products for world wide markets
8807207 alberta is a prime location for world class research and acamp can provide the means to turn research into viable products in fact we are already helping our clients produce marketable products to compete globally
8807208 acamp is the result of a collaborative effort between industry government and academia to create a platform for product development activities in the province
8807209 and we are very pleased to have obtained the services of ken brizel as the first ceo of acamp
8807210 the weight of spacecraft is a key factor in the overall cost of any space mission if we can identify better lighter and more efficient materials and the best ways of using them it may have a huge impact on the space programme
8807211 npls knowledge and experience in both areas make it a natural partner to help esa plan the future of materials for space
8807212 by july 2009 we will know how the space programme can use nanomaterials in the next decade
8807213 weve made movies to show this traffic jam as a function of energy at some energies the traffic is moving and at others the electron traffic is completely blocked
8807214 it has been a frustrating and embarrassing problem to explain why this is the case
8807215 its like taking some cars off the highway during rush hour all of a sudden the traffic starts to move
8807216 in essence the research shows that what is believed to be required to increase the superconductivity in these systems stronger magnetic interactions also pushes the system closer to the quantum traffic jam status where lack of holes locks the electrons into positions from which they cannot move its like gassing up the cars and then jamming them all onto the highway at once theres lots of energy but no ability to go anywhere
8807217 we need to look for materials with such strong pairing but which dont exhibit this mottness or quantum traffic jam effect
8807218 our hope is that they will have less traffic jam effect while having stronger electron pairing
8807219 over the past three years the axiom capital management livingston nanotechnology conference has emerged as an important gathering for the investment community and pioneers in the area of nanotechnology
8807220 im excited to be presenting at scott livingstons new event with a focus on the tremendous opportunities for nanotechnology in the field of healthcare and life science
8807221 our healthcare amp life sciences summit has been designed to bring together key stakeholders from pharmaceutical capital investment business strategy and federal science and regulatory segments
8807222 due to its exclusive nature we can assure that in addition to helping attendees identify key trends the event will provide for significant opportunities among participants for deal making
8807223 as a manufacturing partner and a top tier supplier for dsi etch applications we are dedicated to providing our customers with state of the art process technologies on cost effective systems coupled with a global service and support network in order to deliver the highest level of customer satisfaction
8807224 these most recent orders validate avizas position as a technology and market leader in dsi etch for high volume manufacturing
8807225 this coexistence is an exotic superconducting state that has not been observed in any other superconducting material
8807226 it shows a very strong link between superconductivity and magnetism
8807227 its not clear what the origin of this state is or what creates or modifies it
8807228 its really a question of the chicken and the egg
8807229 does superconductivity need magnetism in this state or does magnetism need superconductivity
8807230 this is a new paradigm for understanding the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity
8807231 it could help us find the basis for understanding unconventional high temperature superconductivity
8807232 we have a very talented and dedicated group of students who are ready and able to tackle the fundamental chemistry problems that must be solved before it will be feasible to produce clean solar fuels on a large scale
8807233 we already have several industrial partners and we intend to add more as we want to move the new materials and processes invented by our center into the commercial arena as rapidly as possible
8807234 these transformations will require the development of new models for understanding multiple electron and proton transfer reactions and catalyst design
8807235 i strongly support chemistrys cbc program as a way to tackle grand challenge problems with potentially transformative societal impacts such as sustainable energy the nocera work and the powering the planet center is an excellent example of this
8807236 one of the central issues in nanotechnology is the development of simple and reliable methods to precisely arrange molecules and other nanoscopic objects one promising route intensively investigated by scientists around the world involves the ability of molecules to spontaneously assemble onto a surface what we have done is successfully combined two strategies which are complementary but so far have been explored independently and it is this combination which opens up unprecedented opportunities for accessing the ultrasmall length scale
8807237 the potential of this approach lies in its flexibility on a scale about 1 10000 of the diameter of a human hair using molecules as building units the features of our structures are less than 5 nanometres in size which enables us to control structures and materials at dimensions where new properties emerge
8807238 we are just at the beginning of the exploration of a very exciting new area ongoing and future work will investigate changes in the dimensions and geometry of the network where the aim is to get exact control over the arrangement of molecules ultimately at the level of single molecules
8807239 in the short term this development provides us with an easily accessible platform for fundamental studies of phenomena on the ultrasmall scale
8807240 in the future we might be able to use this technology for the assembly of nanomachines molecular devices used to transport and manipulate molecules and nanometer sized objects
8807241 drug release from polymeric materials often follows a burst first order kinetic profile which may not be clinically desired
8807242 traditionally the burst effect has been reduced by confining the api to a reservoir within the device but this adds complexity and cost to production
8807243 microencapsulating the drug enabled the use of simple molding processes to fabricate devices containing tens of thousands of microreservoirs and the devices exhibit constant drug release profiles equivalent to traditional reservoir devices this approach greatly simplifies production and adds tremendous flexibility to both single and multi drug devices
8807244 right now we have a good team were not as deep as we were 48 hours ago but were a good club and were going to keep moving forward
8807245 were looking and were looking a little harder when youve had the type of injuries weve had over the past few days
8807246 we want to put ourselves in the best position to reach our ultimate goal but so far theres nothing that is a fit
8807247 i dont feel we have to acquire an infielder i think it will contribute to our success if we look at every opportunity but i dont feel we have to do something no
8807248 last night it was really sore but even that from walking out of the clubhouse it wasnt the same
8807249 it is frustrating but to me it didnt feel like its the same caliber of injury as last time the bigger picture is being out there at the end of the year and being ready for the playoff push
8807250 theres definitely a little pull in there maybe not to the extreme that it was when he hurt it in seattle early in the year but its going to take a little time
8807251 weve got 30 games left and hopefully hes going to be available some time in the month of september and well just see what it is
8807252 but hopefully its going to be a reasonable amount of time with erick and when we expand rosters monday it wont be as much of an issue
8807253 i think hes going to have a nice season for us hes a gifted kid
8807254 i think this fall camp has come pretty natural to me
8807255 i feel like ive gotten back to where i was before
8807256 thats our story and were sticking to it its one of those things you do and you do and you do how much you use it depends
8807257 its a game time thing but hopefully we dont mess it up right
8807258 when you watch him on tape you definitely notice his presence on the field
8807259 youve kind of got to know where he is at all times
8807260 the first play was supposed to be something else and they said base base so i knew i was going in there
8807261 but because of where we were on the field i got the ball and i just remember tackle sam baker pulling and cleaning out a whole side i just had to run and get us out of there
8807262 i love the lds church i love their program and the way they play and i always wanted to go on a mission because its so important to our faith
8807263 the campus was great and so were the players and coaches
8807264 that impressed me but i just didnt like los angeles that much it was too big and i couldnt see myself spending four years here
8807265 it still was a hard decision but i respected coach for saying that
8807266 i got the feeling a lot of coaches were just saying it to say it i talked to my family about it i really wanted to play for coach carroll and my immediate family understood my extended family didnt really understand
8807267 im still interested on going on a mission but the church prefers that you do it before you get very far into your 20s fortunately theres an place on campus for some of the players who are lds members to worship there are six of them on the team
8807268 i understood it from some of the fans but it came from a lot of people even my friends were questioning me theyre all still my friends but some of them i just stopped communicating with i guess ive put them on hold
8807269 we made it work the kids would eat first then the parents
8807270 this is a great place to get started on my next goal my next dream of trying to get more people involved in the sport of swimming but also more people involved in exercising
8807271 i think this is the first time i have ever seen a memorial race for a fan
8807272 jim wasnt only a fan of mine he was a fan of racing
8807273 he truly loved the sport and thats what is going to make this race special
8807274 its hard to build a big point lead when the guy chasing you finishes second all the time
8807275 air pollution is estimated to cause approximately two million premature deaths worldwide
8807276 back in november a lot of people told us we wouldnt make it but to be here to support the candidate is exciting
8807277 i guess my favorite part is being here with all the other volunteers from tennessee
8807278 what i will bring back more than anythign is the feelin gof validation for change in this countrty does work
8807279 im absolutely shocked i still cant believe it youre standing there as theyre reading out the names but you never think youre going to win
8807280 ive had a lot of fun doing it there is a lot of apprehension especially before the swimsuit round you just hope you dont fall over in these high heels
8807281 ive had a good rapport with all the girls of course you always think id love to win but once i met the other contestants there was just a good feeling between all of us i think we all deserved to win tonight
8807282 in particular my dad has pushed me all the way hes always seen me for me and ive really appreciated that he used to be an army man and i think thats always spurred me on to do well
8807283 ive not been spoilt but ive always been encouraged by my father he may have pushed me when i was 16 but i dont regret a single moment im so glad he did encourage me
8807284 i turned 21 on monday i finished an art and design course at college and im now the manager of principles in chelmsford so i think im doing ok
8807285 id like to think this could lead to national and international modelling and i hope this year will be fantastic i still get really nervous doing this sort of thing but i hope in time ill be able to overcome my fears and do what ive always wanted to do and thats to model
8807286 the garment district its not a district its a store
8807287 in which the same outfit is created on various budgets
8807288 i think the one thing holding back more widespread adoption of session beers is the cost people are cheap if there is a 3 and 6 stout available as they cited in the article and theyre the same price then i think a lot of people will go for the more bang for the buck if low abv beers were priced low enough that you can afford to session them more easily then i think this would catch on but if your paying 5 8 a pint in nyc most americans are not going to go for the beer that they would have to spend twice as much on for the equivalent buzz
8807289 weve special features source senators defenseman andrej meszaros agrees to offer sheet with another team kk hockey found this 8 hours ago on
8807290 one bullet away the making of a marine corps officer
8807291 holy mackerel the energy coming out of this country is unrivaled
8807292 more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8807293 it was a much better performance today the score was 3 3 which isnt much different to the other day young matildas lost 4 3 on wednesday but the quality of play was much better today kyah simon 2 and emily van egmond scored the goals but we dominated for maybe 70 of play today from that point of view the scoreline might have been disappointing
8807294 young ashley sykes the dubbo girl had a one on one with a minute to go but the keeper put on a good save so maybe we could have nicked it but overall it was a much better performance today
8807295 we had five or six girls who are a real threat going forward kyah simon nsw is fantastic emily van egmond nsw young sam kerr wa theresa polias nsw and ange formida sa so weve got five or six who are really dangerous who can strike from anywhere
8807296 this is only our third camp together so were going well
8807297 the china games will be against a team a couple of years older than our girls it will be a real physical hit out for our girls against a side about to go to the youth world cup so that will be a real test
8807298 and we lost our teams food for a whole week
8807299 hello michael ballack iam muhannad nayef ali rafeea iam from jordan i
8807300 i find him as a fellow brit an absolute embarrassment he sounds like hes on the
8807301 i think this is a brilliant comentary and this part he howls like king lear and
8807302 he reminds me of elton brand of the nbas sixers
8807303 we have always ensured public safety and welfare as our main priority and have always maintained our buses appropriately
8807304 we will be able to comment further upon receiving results of the investigation reports
8807305 australia and new zealand wont tolerate such voting system because it is race based
8807306 at that time flp was the only part that stressed to accept sir paul reeves recommendations i am here to tell that we cannot afford to have communal voting system this is a matter for you to consider
8807307 i have instructed lta and nrsc to also look into safety features of public vehicles in this case busses to allow for some safety features to be in place to protect against future repetition of this kinds of accidents particularly when busses have fitted windows
8807308 they are trying to hang on to the last straw as we make in roads in giving a real voice and say to ordinary people in the country
8807309 naturally there are some power hungry ethno nationalist sdl leaders and followers supported by the leadership of the methodist church and some chiefs who would not want ordinary people to be empowered in terms of decision making and aspiring for better things in life
8807310 they want to continue to remain in power and in the process ensure that the common people remain disenfranchised
8807311 butterfly fish are in the family chaetodontidae they have deep compressed bodies oval shaped when side on thin when head on they have small pointed mouths with small brush like teeth
8807312 this is a terrible and tragic incident that has had a real impact on our firefighters who attended the scene
8807313 nfa would like to offer our heartfelt condolences to all the families affected by this tragic incident
8807314 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8807315 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8807316 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8807317 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8807318 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8807319 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8807320 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8807321 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8807322 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8807323 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8807324 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8807325 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8807326 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8807327 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8807328 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8807329 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8807330 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8807331 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8807332 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8807333 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8807334 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8807335 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8807336 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8807337 we honor that service but that doesnt mean we have to make him president
8807338 mccain served his country with honor and for that we owe him our gratitude but not our vote
8807339 we are planning for our convention to open on monday
8807340 like all americans we are monitoring the situation closely in the gulf
8807341 you would have to dramatically change the nature of what you do much less partisan much less political
8807342 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination
8807343 these next two games are very important to help us position ourselves to advance to the final stage
8807344 with the win against guatemala we have put ourselves in a good situation at the start of the semifinal round i was very pleased with the way our team stuck together in a difficult environment we need to have that same type of effort in the matches against cuba and trinidad amp tobago
8807345 canberra is definitely being considered for an a league team
8807346 further foundation memberships would significantly help the canberra bid we need to get people to sign up for this once in a lifetime opportunity
8807347 once the 5 000 foundation memberships are taken thats it there will be no extensions
8807348 we have completed our five year business plan and will present to the ffa in the coming weeks
8807349 the number of users who downloaded our patches there were a lot more active players than there were unit sales and i think we can safely say if they were still playing the game by the time our latest patch released and if they were playing on a pirated copy then they were a sale that didnt happen in the middle of difficulty lies opportunity albert einstein dead rising saints row dead or alive 4 fight night round 3 ghost recon aw table tennis chromehounds condemned pgr3 rainbow six vegas lego star wars ii dirt gears of war kameo guitar hero ii halo 3 super paper mario metroid prime 3 mario galaxy zelda twilight princess ddr hottest party lego star wars wii fit brain age 2 zelda phantom hourglass super mario ds new super mario bros yoshis island ds kirby canvas curse meteos mario kart ds asphalt urban gt final fantasy iii my french coach sega master system sega genesis nes snes n64 gamecube gameboy xbox playstation 52
8807350 optimists believe this is the best of all possible worlds pessimists fear that it is true
8807351 i love my dog but my doctor say we cannot make babies i guess well adopt children and just have sechs
8807352 the individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the group if you try it you will be lonely often and sometimes frightened but no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself
8807353 i got kicked out of barnes and noble once for moving all the bibles into the fiction section
8807354 mi entendimiento es que ellos usar n el motor los archivos maya donde los personajes vuelven a la vida pero estar n creando animados creo que es una c mica de 20 minutos estoy personalmente intrigado de ver c mo saldr lego cada vez que han sacado una nueva marca ellos han hecho algo de cgi tambi n pero creo que esto ser bastante diferente
8807355 yes of course you are now we got to buckle down and save planet express
8807356 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
8807357 we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth
8807358 a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8807359 i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle eastand strengthen the recruitment arm of al qaeda
8807360 a successful war against iraq would require a u s occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences
8807361 theres a reason why denver hasnt had a convention in 100 years
8807362 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8807363 i have a dream today a dream deeply rooted in the american dream
8807364 when the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence
8807365 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8807366 there are more people here now we have 20 to 25 people the cameraman is still on the roof and theres a big generator for the equipment
8807367 weve having hot dogs im sure they have pork in them and burgers and salad and beer
8807368 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8807369 those types of charges that the united states was involved in instigating it you know just are without foundation and just ludicrous plain and simple
8807370 it needs to stop blaming others for the aggression that it carried out against a neighbour
8807371 russia is doing a great job on its own in isolating itself
8807372 its not only that the us administration could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army
8807373 its not up to the supreme court to legalize or criminalize abortion
8807374 despite all of the obstacles and the conscientious objections the service is working
8807375 doctors nurses and social workers have lived up to the commitment with a lot of generosity
8807376 i tell them it is legal but that i dont agree with it personally and they will have to find another doctor
8807377 they are just encouraging women to be dirty and loose
8807378 the justices decision is only going to spread more irresponsible behavior
8807379 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet
8807380 more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit cards and bills you cant afford to pay tuition thats beyond your reach the failure to respond is the direct result of broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8807381 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this this country is more decent
8807382 the risk of staying on the same path were on the risk of just more of the same versus the change we need
8807383 mccain wore the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our respect
8807384 but the record is clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 per cent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think president bush has been right 90 per cent of the time
8807385 john mccain says hell follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8807386 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe
8807387 he strove to connect with working class americans because obama and his party know that if he cant do that then all his historic achievements will stop at the level of party nominee rather than the level he truly desires
8807388 this is the biggest moment since martin luther king in the civil rights movement for blacks in the united states
8807389 what should have been a democratic cakewalk is not a democratic cakewalk
8807390 this convention was his chance to reintroduce himself to americans to portray himself as an all american man from an all american family somebody who will not betray the values of the voters that hes going for that hes not a lofty man with his head in the stars
8807391 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8807392 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8807393 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 per cent
8807394 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8807395 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8807396 this looks very serious it is windy rainy trees are also falling down and we have no electricity
8807397 police in denver arrested an abc news producer today as he and a camera crew were attempting to take pictures on a public sidewalk of democratic senators and vip donors leaving a private meeting at the brown palace hotel
8807398 back in london one more person started in on the stars and stripes eventually he got as the europeans always do to the part about your countrys never been invaded this fellow had been two during the blitz you see you dont know the horror the suffering you think that war is
8807399 a john wayne movie i said thats what you were going to say isnt it we think war is a john wayne movie with good guys and bad guys as simple as that well you know something mister limey poofter youre right and let me tell you who those bad guys are theyre us we be bad
8807400 were the baddest assed sons of bitches that ever jogged in reeboks
8807401 of course the guy should have punched me but this was europe he just smiled his shabby superior european smile
8807402 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
8807403 sir i want you to know is we dont hot rod these cars out here and all but we need to tell you that your motor has gone and locked up
8807404 we seen you had some drag racing slips in this car we know you abused it this could have been waiting to happen
8807405 first off those arent for that car and secondly why the hell are you digging in my glove box
8807406 i got kicked out of barnes and noble once for moving all the bibles into the fiction section

8807408 the minor iphone security issue which surfaced this week is fixed in a software update which will be released in september
8807409 theyre saying lower it information technology spending is spreading that is evidence of a global slowdown in it spending this certainly isnt good news for tech overall
8807410 dells outlook is for slower spending especially in asia and western europe
8807411 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter
8807412 its a really tough tech market and dell is obviously cutting costs but it wasnt enough to offset the pressure on gross margin
8807413 reduce stress focus your activity and improve your result with a time management system created specifically for internet entrepreneurs
8807414 thats what i was afraid of i started here last year just after christmas and i remember helping someone from the research unit take decorations down it didnt take very long well just have to be creative
8807415 last year james and i were so busy that we didnt take the time especially because we were planning on spending the holidays with his parents as mine are dead and my sister isnt particularly fond of us shes a muggle you see and the idea of magic is completely contrary to her husbands tastes though she was always curious when i was in school i suspect that she may just be jealous
8807416 you can do things with a wave of your hand that she can only dream of
8807417 unnatural he only says so because he cant do it i cant think of anything more natural or that i feel more right doing
8807418 that may be so but you wont convince them of that in any case they dont make good holiday company and of course james parents are gone now so were spending the holidays with sirius remus and peter and im learning all sorts of new decorating ideas
8807419 id never have thought to charm stationary lights in the bushes so they would be uniformly interspersed james is very particular about it my parents never bothered to decorate the garden we normally just had a tree
8807420 looks like we amateurs will just have to make do
8807421 i say we start with garlands theres some in that box right
8807422 its a long rope or string for decoration often with pine needles or cranberries or the like let me see im sure there is something like that in here
8807423 a larger tree for one more ornaments even a wreath or some tinsel i guess malindas meticulous personality doesnt extend to holiday merriment
8807424 no it doesnt but i think i can help with some of that
8807425 brilliant you directed the focus of your spell we dont need to have all the materials to do what we want just the focus and the will we have everything we need already
8807426 i figure this is a good way to practise lets see what we can do with these ornaments
8807427 it should your focus is to revert them to their original state the problem is that they are chipped and a bit dull i dont see any reason why that shouldnt work just keep your intention and focus constant and consistent will it to work
8807428 this is a start lets see what we can do with the rest of this
8807429 im nearly finished transfiguring more ornaments we should be able to set the tree soon
8807430 i was thinking inside the lounge but either way would be fine i think
8807431 me too but i think weve managed to integrate the theory into our decorating work
8807432 does that mean youve found somewhere to live or is that a clever way of trying to get me off of your scent because youve been procrastinating
8807433 youve caught us weve been so busy that we havent had time to devote to our search and james auror training has picked up i hardly get to see him at all
8807434 have you found more time since our work has been put on hiatus
8807435 but were still sifting through the available homes really we want to find a place in the country that will be a good investment for the future you have to prepare for these things you know
8807436 so i heard about your father im really very sorry
8807437 im sure it must be difficult dealing with the arrangements so quickly
8807438 someone has to do it my mother has been doing most of the work i just have a lot of parchment to sign
8807439 you know that sirius would help if you just asked
8807440 no he wouldnt you know he wouldnt hed laugh and make some sort of joke about the house of black
8807441 in all situations but this one sirius had his chance to be the model son and he botched it up its not my responsibility to fix his mistakes the house of black and its entire inheritance is mine alone
8807442 it was a misunderstanding between him and your parents not concerning you if there is any hope for reconciliation i would think that now would be the best time to try perhaps there isnt any for your mother and brother but the two of you will probably be around for years to come wouldnt it be better to spend those years on good terms and what if you dont end up having those years
8807443 i could say the same thing about you and your sister
8807444 you werent friends with sirius or me when this split happened you werent even friends with james there are bigger things going on here lily i know that you want to see us do something about this but theres nothing to be done its over
8807445 i think the tree is ready now do you want to place it in the lounge
8807446 i suppose its fitting for the spell department to have creative decorations
8807447 happy christmas regulus i hope that you are able to have some peace in your heart regardless of these circumstances
8807448 happy christmas to you too lily ill see you after the holidays im sure
8807449 we could make a breakthrough here there is someone in the department who is giving information to voldemort i know it
8807450 i want proof before we do anything you know that
8807451 we need to figure this out i dont want to continue our research until we know that our secrets are safe
8807452 who do you think is compromised prewett finch black you havent any proof and no leads on any of them weve been over this every day for the past two weeks let it go lets start research again after the holidays
8807453 i dont agree with you but i will continue to consider your perspective as i have assured you for the past week
8807454 give me some time to think this is not a happy task and honestly the whole thing may come to nothing if he doesnt come back
8807455 er hello i was just coming to let you know that im on my way out
8807456 thats very kind thank you for stopping by do send our regards to your mother
8807457 right have a good holiday we havent set a return date have we
8807458 no worries then let me know a few days before you plan to return
8807459 i dont just think ive found him sis i know ive found him christopher devon is the man im sure of it i had such a strong reaction to seeing him
8807460 but he could just be a look alike or someone could be deceiving you
8807461 he matches the criteria in every way possible same height the hair the eyes the hands his jacket sleeve had an oil stain as if he generally carries an oil lamp like he had the night that i saw him
8807462 he has a daughter that lives in doolin thats who he must have been visiting last month no one could be deceiving me because no one knows what im looking for youre the only one
8807463 you were all about finding him a few weeks ago whats wrong now
8807464 ive just been thinking about the risks inherent in what were doing
8807465 what if our grandfather had nothing to do with this what if he just had a falling out with his family we could be getting ourselves and our family in over our heads silas would never forgive us if something happened to alana or clare
8807466 yes youre right but if thats true were already in danger anyway what if were being watched without knowing it
8807467 im sick of waiting for something to happen ive been sitting here for three months and for a while i was content with working on the boats and the accounts but i cant ignore the life that ive lived for the past seven years ive changed too much to leave it behind this is the first connection to it that ive found here
8807468 i think i handled myself quite well both times i dealt with devon previously thank you very much i was one of the best students in my form and received some of the highest marks in all of my classes i know how to defend myself and how to fight back
8807469 i just want to make sure that youve really thought about this because once youve opened this can of worms theres no going back
8807470 im in how do we go about finding devon and convincing him of your identity since you so brilliantly erased his memories
8807471 not to worry i can stop by his office to check the status of the boats and then ask him out for drinks
8807472 meet me in ballyvaughan at that pub near the warehouse at half past five
8807473 just fine have you heard anything from devon about the repairs
8807474 not since last week i was planning on going over there myself to check the progress
8807475 yeah i suppose that would be quite helpful if you wouldnt mind
8807476 not in the least ill prepare the paperwork and go later this afternoon
8807477 that will be a big help not that i should be surprised youve been an enormous help this season i dont know if i could do it without you anymore
8807478 youre welcome i know i havent provided that much help ive probably done more harm than good with everything ive botched but i try howre clare and alana
8807479 we took clare up to the cliffs the other day she had a hard time understanding that the miniature ships in the water were actually the big ships that she sees all the time
8807480 i love being her papa you should try it sometime
8807481 you better watch it i may just decide to keep her to myself someday
8807482 well i suppose i could let you borrow her once in a while as long as you promise to find a respectable girl
8807483 i cant have my daughter fraternizing with women of ill repute i hear sean took you out last month did you meet anyone i met alana when i was your age
8807484 oh well sean set me up with a nice girl but i havent really talked to her since
8807485 i can give you some time off if youd like
8807486 dont worry about me im going to get to work
8807487 right i know im finishing up my paperwork for the visit
8807488 not a problem just wanted to make sure you remembered im going to walk on home alana is meeting some friends tonight and i want to make sure to distract clare well in advance
8807489 mr devon i wonder if i might have a word
8807490 ah liam merric yes do come in silas said he might be coming by sometime this week but did not suggest that you would be as well
8807491 theyre coming along quite nicely i saw them yesterday and i think that youll both be quite pleased with the improvements i honestly cant think of anything else to tell you
8807492 lovely im glad its gone so well is there anything you need me to fill out for you a mid work assessment perhaps
8807493 no we dont have anything like that we generally like to keep up with our clients in person and not on paper ill give silas a ring if there are any problems
8807494 thank you for all of your help and i look forward to hearing from you
8807495 er sir i was wondering if youd like to grab a drink with me
8807496 i just thought i mean youve done so much work for my family and id like to get to know you better silas and my father already seem to know you well
8807497 but ill understand if youre busy or have somewhere to be i remember you said that you visit your daughter in doolin often and i can tell that youre ready to leave here for the day
8807498 actually a drink would be nice i can only take so much time sitting down in the office id much prefer being on the water
8807499 how about that pub down the way by our warehouse
8807500 perfect thats a delightful little place give me a few minutes to finish up here and ill meet you on the street
8807501 so you said you had one daughter in doolin is she about silas age
8807502 aislinn is twenty five and tara is twenty two she just had her birthday
8807503 aislinn the elder i forgot about tara shes at university right
8807504 just the one my wife and i are a bit older than your parents and we had her later in life
8807505 sometimes life does not turn out exactly the way you would have hoped but that does not mean that it turned out poorly i think life has a way of giving us what we need rather than always what we want
8807506 you left school last june right where did you attend
8807507 er a small school in scotland youve likely not heard of it
8807508 its a bit complicated to explain and i wont pretend to understand all of it but some of my wifes relatives have been well just a bit different and you just remind me of them thats all forget i even mentioned it
8807509 i think that were referring to the same thing im a wizard
8807510 no we met in mid october i was walking home from a pub in doolin and it was foggy so i used my wand to light my path and i ran into you you were wearing that same coat and carrying a lantern i startled you and you were amazed by my wand you said so and wanted me to come with you you seemed afraid of something and i was afraid of you too and im very sorry but i erased your memories of me
8807511 id never have told you if i didnt think it was important but i cant get the encounter out of my mind there are things going on here that just do not make sense and then theres my own family past that is somewhat of a mystery to me
8807512 that night you well you said that there were good wizards and bad wizards i was under the impression that i was the only wizard at least in clare and galway the school i was referring to is hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry in scotland its a school for neophyte wizards and witches like me
8807513 look i dont know if you can help me i dont know if youre even willing but i do know that you have more answers than i do right now and ill erase your memories again if thats what you want but if you have the time i would really like to hear what you have to say
8807514 aislinn perfect timing christopher devon this is my sister aislinn merric were both rather curious about our familys past and shes the only member of my family in on what is going on here silas and my father have no idea
8807515 naturally ill be happy to pick up the drink for you
8807516 would you like to continue the conversation we began outside
8807517 right right sorry i had just asked you your opinion on the whole matter and then aislinn walked up
8807518 precisely now i want you both to know that i really have no idea what kind of information youre looking for you seem harmless enough and genuinely curious i dont feel like you mean me any harm so im going to take a risk here
8807519 all right here it is all that i know about magic my wifes father disappeared when she was five years old her mother knew that he was a wizard he had been very up front about his special
8807520 i dont know much more about his work all i know is that one of his partners was a younger cousin he had moved to ireland with his brother after they finished school at your magic academy and he showed a lot of promise but he was not quite keen on the idea of whatever my father in law was researching he backed out and disappeared from our radar at least better for him whatever my father in law had been researching went horribly wrong a few years later there was an explosion in his workshop and my mother in law ran out to look for him but he was gone
8807521 my wife never displayed any sort of magical ability nor has our daughter so im happy about that weve generally tried to keep a low profile so im rather surprised at your story of my actions when i was in doolin but its not impossible i suppose that that is exactly how i would react if i were walking on the street at midnight in the fog and i saw a wand light up weve lived in fear that my father in law would come looking for us for years
8807522 so thats what you mean about there being good wizards and bad wizards
8807523 im sure there was more to it than that but thats all that my wife knows or at least all that shes seen fit to tell me
8807524 you see there have been several disturbances in the grammar school where i work and i wonder if they are of any relation to you
8807525 its our mothers maiden name and her father was a wizard
8807526 a wizard who moved to ireland with his brother and kept as low a profile as anyone ive ever met a wizard who did not even tell his own daughter what he was until magic started manifesting in liam when he was little
8807527 that would mean that were of some distant relation by marriage if nothing else
8807528 hi sirius lily everyone i didnt mean to disturb you im waiting for a friend
8807529 its all right lily hes not my brother anymore anyway
8807530 were all civilized people here im very sorry to hear about your father regulus sirius has been sorry as well
8807531 you were the one staring at us you must want something
8807532 maybe you should examine your actions more closely im sure that there are other ways that your moral compass doesnt point due north
8807533 youre brothers youre family why are you doing this to each other
8807534 isnt this what you wanted for us to have a conversation
8807535 how could i have not realised that regulus meant you when he said he was waiting for a friend youre perfect for each other
8807536 thats right run away go tell your dark lord that sirius black and james potter are making your lives a living hell
8807537 are you mad what possessed you to start a row with them youre supposed to be keeping a low profile
8807538 try again do you realise what youve done i doubt lily will ever talk to you again she might even quit her job well have to rely on peter for everything and i dont trust him
8807539 dont you think peter is a better way to get to the heart of the matter

8807547 all mccain had to do to win was eavesdrop on bill and hillarys room last night
8807548 the conference is very concerned of so much suffering and poverty and the nation and people must not be subjected to any further hardships which could result from further sanctions by our neighbors and the international community
8807549 in their annual meetings last may fifty of the fifty divisions of the church fiji wide have indicated they do not support the charter the churchs decision to reject the charter proposal is based on such mandate
8807550 while the charter proposes some noble principles the conference is of the view that the interim government and the national council for building a better fiji do not have any moral or legal authority to impose it on the people
8807551 the draft charter proposes to develop a moral vision for the common good however there are numerous historical examples of the failure of moral declarations to create a good society the inquisition the repressive laws of fundamentalist states and coups that persecute and terrorize the community in our times are part of historical evidence which confirm the inability of human law to enforce morality in any society true justice and morality cannot be created by legislation and coercion it can come only as the fruit of free moral choice declarations in the charter and laws that are written in statute books but not in the hearts of people are not worth the paper they are written on
8807552 the conference holds that it is in all our interest to support the rule of law any attempt to impose and legitimize the charter outside the constitution and by an authority which does not have the peoples mandate is morally unacceptable it defies gods authority because it lacks any legal basis and it limits the free choice of the people to act according to their conscience
8807553 we believe that the most powerful influence that drive communal politics is not race but the perception of racial economic inequality so de racialising politics in fiji cannot be successful without first de racialising the perception of economic inequality between our racial groups therefore any insensitive reforms to merely decentralize political communal representation will not lead to unity but could instead be a cause of future contention
8807554 the conference holds that in our multiracial multicultural nation it would be to our own detriment if race based constitutionally allowed affirmative action and communal based electoral systems were dismantled contrary to the expressed will of the majority and contrary to the rule of law and the constitution
8807555 the conference affirms the pivotal christian belief that jesus christ is the only way to god and salvation
8807556 the term fijian refers to the legal ownership of land and other assets it would be more responsible if the ncbbf had instead recommended for more frank and good faith negotiation with the fijian community on the matter of a common name
8807557 but the driver hit the gas and i mean he hit the gas in the next instant i was on the ground clutching my knee in pain

8807575 artistic luxury faberg tiffany lalique will be a stunning exhibition and the perfect show to open our new special exhibitions galleries a major part of our building and renovation project which began in 2005
8807576 this exhibition builds on our commitment to quality scholarship and the development of programming that truly engages and educates audiences in cleveland and throughout the u s
8807577 this exhibition grew out of a desire to study the incredible diversity of work created by designers of luxury goods from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the first world war and the dynamic competition that resulted
8807578 faberg tiffany and lalique were the first to market themselves as

8807581 i am delighted that the art fund has helped to put such a fantastic example of hodgkins work back on display in bath the very city where hodgkin spent a great deal of his early life as both an art student and art teacher
8807582 the acquisition of silence fills a very significant gap in the gallerys collection given the artists intimate connections with bath silence is not only a beautiful and lyrical painting in its own right it also represents the culmination of a development that was nurtured in bath fifty years earlier

8807589 it is impossible to imagine an australian national portrait gallery without a portrait of bradman bill leak painted the portrait from life in 1990 and included in it a subtle visual allusion to bradmans elegance and effectiveness with the bat during his playing career leak is one of our best political cartoonists but in this portrait we see him in serious portrait mode paying tribute to a towering figure in australian sporting history
8807590 in a country where religion has largely been replaced by sport it was easy to see my responsibility as capturing the likeness of the almighty
8807591 manure mud and non colors to paint really bad paintings
8807592 establish something against all of the beautiful things aggressively and with a fierce contradiction
8807593 produced the worst possible paintings these would never be good enough

8807599 its really important that consumers understand that and that they have peace of mind
8807600 were going to be going out to construction bid next month
8807601 whats new about this location is the fact it is the new prototype
8807602 that makes the box more profitable if more can be done with less
8807603 we use less water and we use less energy because we run so efficiently
8807604 thats the way its been predominantly a lot of the time
8807605 i think they kind of skip over me i like that because its less pressure for me we just do the best we can stay under the radar i guess and see what we can do
8807606 if we could just win a race and get that behind us i think everybody would be a little bit more relaxed
8807607 this now makes it complete this is an important day for the mission because we do not actually have an idol now
8807608 it just signifies the concepts that we are learning it also inspires devotion and it inspires that love for god whatever that means to each person
8807609 we just enjoy coming here and learning about our vedanta and literature
8807610 the main thing is there is a place we can call our own
8807611 new jersey is clearly out in front of a growing national issue
8807612 all of us owe george soros a great deal of gratitude
8807613 he thinks the ballot question is a responsible initiative to reduce the overreliance on criminal justice sanctions in dealing with marijuana
8807614 marijuana should not be a priority of the criminal justice system
8807615 decriminalizing marijuana is a slippery slope and sends the wrong message
8807616 compounding this is the fact that users of marijuana are 10 times more likely to be injured or injure others in automobile crashes
8807617 they can move on and get a student loan and get their first apartment and move on with their lives
8807618 people recognize that there are a lot better things we could be doing with our police resources
8807619 our government is totally arbitrary in making dangerous drugs legal while locking people up for the mere possession of a much less dangerous drug they would rather go on collecting a lot of money from pharmaceutical and liquor lobbyists than do what best for the american people
8807620 compounding this is the fact that users of marijuana are 10 times more likely to be injured or injure others in automobile crashes
8807621 any black man is ineligible to run for president and that any vote for himself or anyone else is invalid
8807622 this purchase will add nothing to the communities along this line there is no benefit which will accrue to our community only problems

8807626 just over one per cent of iphone owners used more than one gigabyte of data in their first month while about 95 per cent of owners used less than 500mb
8807627 were generally happy with what weve been getting out of it and weve learned a tremendous amount
8807628 regardless of what happens to it were going to get this thing well written up and documented
8807629 bob bussard was a truly innovative person thats abundantly clear
8807630 i hope he will be remembered for that i think that will be the case
8807631 if john mccain wants a debate over who has the temperament to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im willing to have
8807632 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8807633 all across america something is stirring this election is not about me its about you
8807634 we can keep ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
8807635 i love the job but ive got other responsibilities the children a home life and an elderly dad who needs me and ive recognised that i cant have it all
8807636 but after all those years of getting up at 4am we can understand why she wants a change
8807637 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8807638 because you live and work in the united states right
8807639 why did you bring four big bags full of nothing but books
8807640 has not determined what happened to the painting or its current whereabouts
8807641 the loss of this valuable and irreplaceable painting has saddened the entire community and we still hope it will be found
8807642 some men see things as they are and say why
8807643 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of moral crisis preserved their neutrality
8807644 32 measures of the same loop doesnt usually hold my interest
8807645 america is not rome we do not dream of empire we dream of liberty and justice for all
8807646 this is a nearly psychotic man with a deep seated need for larger than life approval the expression of this need eclipses everything else in his world to an extreme sociopathic degree when he gets up in the morning if he sleeps at all he has no free choice except to seek another audience to bolster his arrogance and his ego what this maniac doesnt realize yet what he wont permit himself to admit is that he will fail in his mission to become the president of the united states his arrogance and lack of conscience will catch up with him and bring him down
8807647 the history here thats not too impressive of a record
8807648 hopefully we can add on to that a little bit more
8807649 certainly not the way we drew it up the thing thats really painful for me and the staff is you want to give people a reason to believe
8807650 i feel like we let a lot of people down
8807651 i was proud of them it would have been easy to come here and not be ready to play
8807652 i dont know if ive ever been this nervous about an opening game weve always played well as the underdog but i was really concerned about having that top 25 ranking coming in here
8807653 kirbys been through some ups and downs we felt like he deserved the opportunity and we gave it to him
8807654 i thought griffin provided a spark which is what he has to do for us
8807655 if you dont have fresh ideas you make a big election about small things
8807656 an attractive drop down appears on the hover and i am presented with the following
8807657 we have to start distinguishing between use and abuse of marijuana as we do with alcohol
8807658 there are people who will abuse any substance and others who will use that substance responsibly and our policy has to change to address this issue
8807659 thats why the majority are in the closet on this issue
8807660 these are middle class adults with kids and responsibilities and they are not criminals at all
8807661 we wanted to come out and give a great show for the fans and i think we did some great things on defense and some good things on offense
8807662 its a big ball game for this team and for south florida and an opportunity for us to go up there and play a great opponent
8807663 theyve got a tremendous offense tremendous defense and we feel great for the chance to go up there and play such a great team
8807664 things didnt happen the way we wanted but youve got to expect that out of any football game
8807665 especially when youre playing such a good opponent like miami
8807666 i put my teammates in positions that they could make plays not me
8807667 i learned if i could give the ball to my teammates everything will be ok i dont need to be the one going out there making spectacular plays
8807668 it felt like we had a junior or senior out there playing quarterback
8807669 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
8807670 it wasnt what i would call an endorsement of russias recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia
8807671 the active role of russia in promoting peace and cooperation in the given region
8807672 multiple criminal acts including bombings and attacks against iraqi targets
8807673 if its right that theyve arrested the man who was in charge i will sue him
8807674 this incident shows the need for an end to the random arrest of iraqis by the american forces which are against the human rights outlined in the constitution it proves for a fact that each iraqi might be arrested or put in prison without knowing the reasons
8807675 it is a message for the baathists to go on in their wrongdoings
8807676 this guy was doing his job perfectly hes served his country by all his efforts since 2003
8807677 multiple criminal acts including bombings and attacks against iraqi targets
8807678 if its right that theyve arrested the man who was in charge i will sue him
8807679 this incident shows the need for an end to the random arrest of iraqis by the american forces which are against the human rights outlined in the constitution it proves for a fact that each iraqi might be arrested or put in prison without knowing the reasons
8807680 it is a message for the baathists to go on in their wrongdoings
8807681 this guy was doing his job perfectly hes served his country by all his efforts since 2003
8807682 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8807683 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8807684 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8807685 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8807686 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis also in mens
8807687 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8807688 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8807689 this made history in mexico and the rest of the region
8807690 criminalizing abortion discriminates against women and it has never been proven that the product of conception is protected by the constitution
8807691 this made history in mexico and the rest of the region
8807692 criminalizing abortion discriminates against women and it has never been proven that the product of conception is protected by the constitution
8807693 theres just too many issues with this offense for people to deal with
8807694 we had two and a half weeks to deal with it the rest of these folks will get two days good luck acc
8807695 had dwyer in our sights about three times and just couldnt tackle him
8807696 we are a team that is very young and new to the big scene
8807697 41 points is a lot better than 14 im sure of that an ugly win is better than a pretty loss
8807698 in this offense you dont know when someone is going to break a long run
8807699 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8807700 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8807701 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8807702 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8807703 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
8807704 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8807705 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8807706 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8807707 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8807708 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana

8807712 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8807713 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8807714 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8807715 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8807716 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8807717 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8807718 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8807719 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8807720 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8807721 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8807722 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8807723 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8807724 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8807725 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8807726 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8807727 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8807728 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8807729 it is best to aim a bit forward of the flys starting position to anticipate where it is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8807730 oh no honey im not cheating on you i have a disease i need rehab
8807731 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8807732 the traders told us that most of these dolls are popular with teenagers who bought them for their own private collection or as gifts for their friends
8807733 action has to be taken as such pornographic dolls affect societys moral values
8807734 32 measures of the same loop doesnt usually hold my interest
8807735 we can disappear somewhere jill and claire cant find us
8807736 awright this takes care of my obligation with 3 days to spare no less
8807737 i know what it is like to have no personal connection with lifeway
8807738 ive been criticized for saying he inspires me to hell with my critics
8807739 it is clear from the response you are seeing that this audience clearly feels that this is the man and this speech has met the challenge of this venue and this speech was all that he wanted it to be
8807740 vote for him or do not but take pride that this nation can produce men and speakers such as that for 42 minutes not a sour note and spell binding throughout in a way usually reserved for the creations of fiction
8807741 i thought it was an exceedingly smart speech in which barack obama played both offense and defense very effectively
8807742 what you heard was very down there plain spoken no bs if you will
8807743 it was a great way of throwing back the best shot and saying the other side is full of crap ive been criticized for saying he inspires me to hell with my critics
8807744 i think someone may have put some obama koolaid into my water here i thought it was great
8807745 i know what it is like to have no personal connection with lifeway
8807746 i know what it is like to have no personal connection with lifeway
8807747 the democratic platform on the first day of the convention was somewhat vague
8807748 thats been the big criticism from republicans that hes all show and no substance
8807749 if voters dont know who he is after this they never will
8807750 you can expect tomorrow that republicans are going to criticise everything the democratic party said tonight
8807751 weve got to get into the habit of defending ourselves
8807752 i hope the countrys above that above negative ads and that they will vote not out of fear
8807753 its so positive rather than the politics of fear its the politics of optimism even republicans are tired of the fear of the warmongering
8807754 he said that were here as americans not as democrats he played how hard times really are but said we can change
8807755 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8807756 i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion
8807757 i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8807758 when i found out we were going i started jumping up and down i was so excited
8807759 this is a huge historical moment world wide no matter how you look at it
8807760 i think what dr king said 45 years ago has come to fruition
8807761 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
8807762 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8807763 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8807764 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8807765 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8807766 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8807767 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8807768 what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes
8807769 because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8807770 overall unpatched systems and lack of user awareness coupled with the number of people freely roaming the internet makes these rce vulnerabilities more profitable and more easily exploitable than the remote attacks from days gone by
8807771 were seeing a lot of the same things weve seen in the past in regards to whats being patched as far as ie and its as important as ever for microsoft
8807772 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8807773 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8807774 everything else being equal if you are happy and satisfied with your life now you are more likely to be healthy in the future importantly our results are independent of several factors that impact on health such as smoking physical activity alcohol consumption and age
8807775 during the past four weeks have you been a happy person
8807776 all things considered how satisfied are you with your life
8807777 we found strong evidence that both happiness and life satisfaction have an effect on our indicators of health
8807778 there are indications that as you become happier and more satisfied with your life you tend to become healthier as well
8807779 their unique contribution is the short three year time period of their study
8807780 to my knowledge this the shortest time ive seen where looking at baseline happiness predicts future health it is compelling to me that measuring someones happiness now accounts for some differences in physical health in as little as three years
8807781 recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that a single genetic event in the map kinase signaling pathway may be sufficient for thyroid cell transformation and tumor development
8807782 thyroid cancer is associated with exposure to external or internal ionizing radiation elucidation of mechanisms of radiation induced cancer in humans especially early steps and pathways has potential implications for epidemiological risk analyses early clinical diagnosis and chemopreventive interventions
8807783 that means that a younger person living close to the bombing site would be more likely to have adult onset thyroid cancer having ret ptc rearrangements
8807784 it could be either by direct dna damage or by other pathways such as a result of radiation induced genomic instability
8807785 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8807786 i dont realize yet that i beat the no 1 player in the world
8807787 i dont realize yet that i played on the big court i dont know how im going to sleep tonight

8807816 eric basically wants alex off the yankees there are a few problems with that they seem to want him around and no other team would be willing to take on the nine years remaining on his contract
8807817 there are a few problems with that they seem to want him around and no other team would be willing to take on the nine years remaining on his contract
8807818 well what about jason bay and manny ramirez the red sox are doing just fine without that prima donna
8807819 but no one else would have given him that deal the yankees bid against themselves
8807820 give me a guy like doug mientkiewicz on my team over a rod any day of the week
8807821 give me a guy like doug mientkiewicz on my team over a rod any day of the week
8807822 give me a guy like doug mientkiewicz on my team over a rod any day of the week
8807823 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
8807824 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
8807825 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
8807826 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs hardball echoing comments he made earlier in the day at an event promoting his book at the national press club
8807827 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
8807828 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
8807829 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
8807830 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
8807831 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
8807832 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
8807833 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
8807834 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
8807835 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
8807836 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow
8807837 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
8807838 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
8807839 well the point is it turned out they didnt but everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them he catalogued they catalogued them this was not some some cheney you know pipe dream this was in fact catalogued
8807840 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
8807841 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
8807842 the threat saddam hussein presented was that if saddam was left unfettered which i said during that period for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers then i believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon not by building it by purchasing it
8807843 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
8807844 i mean the truth of the matter is that that the americas this administrations policy and the surge are a failure and that the surge which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and long enough to give political reconciliation theres been no political reconciliation the reality is that although there has been some mild progress on the security front there is in fact no no real security in baghdad and or in anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence sectarian violence is as strong and as solid and as serious a problem as it was before the surge started
8807845 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
8807846 if he surges another 20 30 or whatever number hes going to into baghdad itll be a tragic mistake in my view but as a practical matter theres no way to say mr
8807847 unless we fundamentally change the rotation dates and fundamentally change how many members of the national guard were calling up itll be virtually impossible to maintain 150 000 folks this year
8807848 there has been an explosion inside batticaloa prison seven people have been injured and admitted to batticaloa hospital

8807856 every designer that comes to work at porsche comes by to look at the 001
8807857 it saved a little bit of wire a little bit of money
8807858 when i have kids they wont ever act like that
8807859 local newspaper columnists end up being ravenous scavengers scrounging for any morsel from their life to turn into column fodder then needing another one a day later someone once said writing a daily column is like being married to a nymphomaniac the first two weeks are fun after that its work
8807860 it only took me 50 years to figure that out
8807861 if they dont give me job security it doesnt matter
8807862 i tried to not sway them one way or the other just to get their opinion
8807863 you need to make the right call you dont want to get sideways with the members
8807864 were afraid that our leaders will drag this out for an unnecessary strike
8807865 ive done it so many times before i can do it again

8807884 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
8807885 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
8807886 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
8807887 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
8807888 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
8807889 senator mccain has always been sensitive to national crises in the 2000 race he postponed his announcement because of the situation in the balkans and we are monitoring the situation very closely
8807890 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8807891 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
8807892 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
8807893 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
8807894 slammed ms marquez to the floor then handcuffed and charged the unconscious and seriously injured woman with obstruction of governmental administration and disorderly conduct
8807895 were happy with the verdict but its a shame this should have been limited to one death
8807896 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
8807897 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8807898 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8807899 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
8807900 how could any juror not want to see this person removed from our list of living human beings how could you live with yourself as a juror if theres any chance this human being could escape from jail and do something like this again
8807901 by the verdict today they have given voice to the victims
8807902 its not something where you go well you can wait a couple years we cant wait
8807903 we need him today i understand idaho needs to finish their stuff but we need him as soon as possible i cant wait
8807904 should i rob a bank because im low on cash
8807905 yeah congratulations you did it good for you whoop eee
8807906 our little ginny is in first grade my where has the time gone
8807907 for i know the plans i have for you plans to prosper you and not harm you plans to give you hope and a future
8807908 this is gods word on the subject ill show up and take care of you as i promised and bring you back home i know what im doing i have it all planned out plans to take care of you not abandon you plans to give you the future you hope for
8807909 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8807910 its a close election now its going to be a close election after the conventions its going to be a close election probably until the end
8807911 voters around the country have learned more about who barack obama is the values he holds his promise to the american people that hes going to be just a relentless fighter for the middle class and change the way washington works
8807912 coming out of here were not just unified our party is electrified
8807913 obama has to sell himself thats his big job for the next two months
8807914 they gave a lot of good speeches they have taken some steps to repair the obama clinton schism
8807915 but only time will tell how successfully theyve done that there are a lot of blue collar voters who are simply not going to vote for barack obama for reasons of ideology culture his past associations we may not know how many until election day
8807916 itll be a chance for us to run in the altitude a little bit
8807917 the men are going to be a little more talented than the women
8807918 if we can get a couple of our guys to step up were going to be a lot better off
8807919 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8807920 it is that promise that has always set this country apart
8807921 to be on the floor when something like this has happened i know i have witnessed history today
8807922 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8807923 more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8807924 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8807925 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8807926 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8807927 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8807928 this is truly a good day for america tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8807929 i could not help but thinking how proud my father would be
8807930 proud of barack obama proud of the party that nominated him and proud of the nation that will elect him
8807931 is this really some glitzy production or it is about experience and credentials
8807932 only a cynical person like karl rove or the people who are running mccains campaign think that its bad to get people excited again
8807933 were celebrating on the shoulders of some people who could never have imagined this
8807934 i would like to thank the clubs for their input and the spirit in which they accepted the decision
8807935 a number of factors were taken into consideration before we reached the decision and now that we know where the mtn 8 final will take place we can plan full steam ahead to make this a memorable occasion for both teams soccer fans and our wonderful partner mtn
8807936 we are happy with the decision and assure all supporters of an exciting event on september 20 which also coincides with the peace one day campaign which will form part of the celebrations on the day
8807937 for the first time ever we will have 22 cameras capturing the match the most for any sporting event in south africa we will also provide exciting new technology like ultra motion super and trackers for off sides and distances to goal
8807938 we will have total production crew of 60 working on the final
8807939 he was just stressed out at the end of a difficult day of negotiations
8807940 we are in discussions with every restaurant chain that would do well in the mall and there is a great deal of interest
8807941 lets just say were on the high side and theyre on the low side
8807942 we assist our passengers for lax that are disabled were not properly trained if theres an emergency we dont know what to do we need proper benefits for our families we only have it for ourselves and we need to be able to pay for our rent and living expenses as well as everything else
8807943 we have some workers that help disabled people and they feel frustrated because they have no training on how to deal with different physical challenges and also people that check the planes for dangerous items so proper training the proper equipment to do their jobs as well as quality jobs that pay a decent wage
8807944 they dont want to give us anything the companies and the airlines
8807945 we have to pay rent everything is going up and our salaries are still the same
8807946 yeah take them seriously they obviously feel very passionately about it
8807947 good for them dont know if it will make any difference
8807948 upn stands for either your property next or under pigs noses depending on what mood theyre in this is a tagging crew thats responsible for between 480 000 and 1 million worth of damage to the l a county transit system
8807949 the most obvious tip is their tag which in a way is them signing their name
8807950 if a bus is tagged we can find out where this bus was tagged and then we start working that neighborhood and no surprise street signs in that neighborhood are tagged and then you find out that it might be this person go to their house the lawn furniture is tagged the thermostat is tagged
8807951 we think the case is very strong that something stinks on the other side and voters need to take a close look
8807952 we are certainly trying to achieve collective bargaining in california we are trying to protect the interest of our members but there is absolutely no tie between this contribution and anything else were doing on the legislative front
8807953 filing this thing is the cheapest form of political theater
8807954 this money exchange is terrible for the people of california
8807955 he has more special interest money than any other governor has ever had and now hes pointing the finger at us saying were not playing fair
8807956 the cake is our way of saying happy anniversary to oasis state park eastwood said
8807957 so many things up there that people are not aware of and if i can convince one person to look up i have done well
8807958 one of the dilemmas you get caught in here is that in these economic times demand for services is going up
8807959 we have pretty substantial changes to make here but were a big county we have a big budget and were financially stable its about how do we change what we do now to make it better or how do we decide not to do some things in the future that we do now
8807960 i dont want budget cuts put on the backs of child protection workers
8807961 in child protection we better know what we need to do because children will pay
8807962 for the lack of a better word waste around here people who are just staying and staying and staying
8807963 we cant just say we have a lot of dead wood out there i dont think we know that
8807964 its a complicated system and id like us to assess that so we can say with some confidence whether that is true
8807965 isnt any fat in this organization in any organization this size there clearly is some
8807966 i dont think its a big piece of this budget
8807967 i want to thank the players agent mike fola of sport midfield agency for giving our girls this life time opportunity to play at the highest level
8807968 just look for the ones with puke down their fronts and green faces
8807969 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8807970 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8807971 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8807972 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8807973 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8807974 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8807975 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8807976 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8807977 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8807978 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8807979 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8807980 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8807981 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8807982 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8807983 in the past these may have been viewed as victimless crimes
8807984 but in reality theres significant damage this law allows us to prosecute these cases
8807985 its going to affect the sales of the record and its not fair the internet is what it is and you have to deal with it accordingly but i think if someone goes and steals something its theft
8807986 it rips up the lottery ticket it takes the wind out of everything
8807987 the more you mess around with the details the more likely the album is to leak on the internet spoiling whatever big plans youre cooking up anyway
8807988 mbah dukun pun berkata nah perhatikan ya cara simbah melipat gandakan uang

8808037 il faut que nous soyons non seulement la hauteur des enjeux mais la hauteur de nous m mes il faut quon prenne conscience queffectivement les fran ais nous regardent quelquefois avec un peu de scepticisme dinqui tude mais aussi despoir dattente alors faisons ensemble de ces universit s le beau rendez vous des socialistes non pas avec eux m mes mais avec le pays
8808038 ce que je demande aux uns et aux autres et moi m me cest que nous fassions bloc cest que nous fassions parler les socialistes dune seule voix je ne veux pas que luniversit d t soit lobjet de conciliabules de combinaisons
8808039 l pour cr er des rapprochements pour que ceux qui depuis des ann es ont port la m me conception du parti de la gauche se retrouvent tous ceux l doivent former la prochaine direction du parti socialiste
8808040 faire attention ce que les images ne remplacent pas le fond
8808041 il faudra un moment donn un chef et ce quelquun ne r ussira que si dabord nous avons une vraie perspective
8808042 nous avons beaucoup de points communs avec bertrand delano mais nous avons beaucoup de points communs avec les amis de dominique strauss kahn de laurent fabius de benot hamont des grands lus
8808043 il y a des nuages noirs qui samoncellent sur la situation conomique de la france avec la r cession les socialistes ont une responsabilit minente ils doivent donner une image de retenue tre la hauteur de ce que lon attend de nous et bannir les petites phrases
8808044 le spectacle dune force d sorganis e et en crise il faut donc clarifier le projet et adopter des r gles de fonctionnement qui emp chent lindividualisme de lemporter sur le collectif

8808050 los siete arc ngeles que se encuentran en la presencia de dios
8808051 unfortunately the rapid and accelerating decline of sales in the motor home industry during the first quarter caused heavy operating losses that were exacerbated by an aggressive discounting environment and downtime at our plants
8808052 dealers are reducing their inventories significantly and manufacturers orders are considerably below the dealers weak retail sales rates
8808053 estamos ante uno de esos instantes decisivos en la historia
8808054 un momento en que nuestra naci n est en guerra nuestra econom a se tambalea y la promesa americana est bajo amenaza una vez m s
8808055 necesitamos un presidente que pueda hacer frente a las amenazas del futuro y no uno que se agarre al pasado

8808058 its been three years now since the indictment and this ruling is a great conclusion
8808059 the governments conduct was wrong and when they did nothing to cure the violation the indictment was properly dismissed justice has really prevailed here
8808060 the key problem is when you have factual information that can only be provided by waiving privilege what happens then
8808061 while i think that filips announcement is a good faith effort to try to address the ongoing concerns that have existed i think there is still an issue here that will continue to generate concern among lawyers who represent companies in these criminal prosecutions
8808062 in the new guidelines there is still a pressure to waive attorney client privilege if you have relevant factual information covered by attorney client privilege that the government wants to get
8808063 and quite a bit of relevant factual information is subject to privilege claims
8808064 take notes from witness interviews sure you can tell the government what the person said but the government is often interested in seeing the notes of the interview and other material memoranda that would be subject to privilege
8808065 if that material is seen as relevant factual information then what is that company to do
8808066 now the justice department will say you dont have to waive but everybodys in that boat when it comes to dealing the government they dont care whether or not you waive they just want some information
8808067 i dont know if theres a policy that anybody can develop that will really take that pressure away other than not expecting corporations to cooperate as much
8808068 i think former deputy ag eric holder was happy when his name was disassociated with government overreach and so was former deputy ag larry thompson
8808069 if this player shows he can successfully challenge the ncaa this could have much broader implications
8808070 this could have a dramatic impact on the ncaas ability to manipulate these kids
8808071 they are punishing this kid for something this is commonplace among his peers
8808072 i love days in which i dont have to go to work
8808073 if im not doing it good enough you can do it yourself
8808074 we do not intend to curtail peoples freedom or right to express themselves everyone is subjected to the law even websites and blogs
8808075 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8808076 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8808077 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8808078 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8808079 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8808080 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve experienced in the history of humankind
8808081 not only in the heat of this election but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country
8808082 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8808083 because these two clowns are just going to say the same things back and forth to each other
8808084 most summer associates and law students are on facebook and so are our associates
8808085 so we thought a facebook page would be a good way of enhancing the firms image in terms of being accessible
8808086 demanding rent equivalent to the value of 35 000 1912 gold coins
8808087 its a very interesting little area of the law weve developed some expertise in
8808088 doesnt look feel or strike anyone as material you would have to disclose
8808089 rogers had such a detailed history of criminal and civil misconduct and tax evasion prior to his involvement with pay by touch that any knowledge of this would have warned investors
8808090 i dont think you can return an item for spite
8808091 if it were unsatisfactory in some way then we could do it for you but im afraid spite doesnt fit any of our conditions for a refund
8808092 in attempting to exercise his contractual discretion out of spite jerry breached his duty to act in good faith towards the other party in the contract
8808093 its a very interesting little area of the law weve developed something an expertise in
8808094 intentionally recklessly and negligently providing extensive banking services to the palestine islamic jihad and to hamas which caused enabled and facilitated terrorist attacks
8808095 they were warned given the name of the hamas official and even given the dates and amounts of the transfers
8808096 the bank should have been paying attention to transfers made for just under 100 000 each which is the amount frequently used to cover up money laundering

8808170 in the middle is a sweet tired town of roughly 35 000 people three quarters of them latino and more than half considered low income under
8808171 youve got a governor who has raised more special interest contributions than any politician in california history and is holding five and six figure fundraisers across the street from the capitol and hes criticizing people who are trying to thwart his political agenda
8808172 i dont know if he the driver fell asleep but there were no brakes
8808173 there would be some damage although it would not be widespread but certainly some chimneys would be damaged there would be cracks in plaster and some masonry would be damaged on the outside
8808174 these are very moderate there are earthquakes this size in the world every day
8808175 we are working in close partnership with the appropriate levels of government and stakeholders to ensure that collectively were appropriately prepared
8808176 we have swarms of activity in this area every once in a while
8808177 some hours we have an earthquake every minute or two other hours we are not quite so busy
8808178 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8808179 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8808180 the latest forecasts for tropical storm gustav suggest a slightly lower chance of major disruptions in oil production
8808181 the shale production story is certainly a good news story
8808182 in 2008 we had some important announcements regarding discoveries and production of shale and certainly the expectation is that all these unconventional sources will allow for net increases in production despite what we know is the decline of conventional production in western canada and the u s
8808183 there is this disconnect between the two prices compared to what historically has been the case
8808184 natural gas prices are reflecting a much stronger supply picture and oil prices are reflecting a much greater degree of uncertainty and tighter fundamentals
8808185 when you start to drill the holes in the ground you start to improve the technology all the techniques you need to get at the gas and costs start to come down
8808186 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers
8808187 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8808188 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying even as late as wednesday we had secured a new investment package but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8808189 have sought creditor protection by filing legal notices of intention to appoint an administrator in both the u k and canada
8808190 the suspension of operations is a result of the exceptionally difficult trading conditions which have affected all airlines over the last 12 months
8808191 we have worked hard over the last seven years to build up a successful business but have incurred losses in the current year due to the unprecedented increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate the increase in the price of oil has added around 50 million to our annual operating costs and we could not recover that from passengers who had already booked their flights
8808192 we have just had to book three tickets through toronto on air canada and british airways at great expense
8808193 no offers of future flights compensation or alternate arrangements were offered
8808194 the beneficial effects of the tax stimulus cheques and foreign demand are fading fast
8808195 i think were in for a rough road over the next couple quarters and i dont think we can do much in the short run
8808196 with a slight fear of being tackled by police i hopped on the highest counter i could see and shouted out the news
8808197 i asked for their attention and belted it out in my best theatrical voice i told them they were all famous they were being reported on the news we came out and the media was waiting for us so they knew everybody but us knew
8808198 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8808199 even as late as wednesday we had secured a new investment package but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8808200 ive been living here for seven years and this was my moving back to canada day
8808201 that was a lot of drama in itself and now im having to wait for this its not exactly fun
8808202 we knew that they were in administration protection but on that basis as far as we were aware from our legal advice the aircraft could operate
8808203 if there had been only one or two instances the commission might not have been as upset
8808204 the commission felt that the file was thick enough to have special conditions were expecting everybody to abide to these rules the others are doing it why not shaw
8808205 they shaw have to speak with the financial analysts and tell them not to worry what else will they say than that they will abide by the rules
8808206 i dont see prices softening that may just be the perception
8808207 its more of a negotiating market with a little more to choose from theres a little more opportunity to negotiate
8808208 its more of a negotiating market theres a little more to choose from a little more room to negotiate
8808209 i do think it will keep those marginal buyers out
8808210 its been such a joy to take this show to so many countries that ive never been to before but its a real thrill to be bringing it home to australia and to be able to share it with you all
8808211 im so excited to finally be able to bring my show to new zealand this will be my second visit but my first concert performance and i cant wait to see you all there
8808212 this years season ticket package is the strongest weve had in years perhaps ever
8808213 including exhibitions we have 17 home games with a potential for 18 if we advance to the finals of the wnit thats two more than we had in 2007 and three more than we had in 2006 additionally this years home opponents have the potential to be the strongest collective group of teams to come to norman prior to january

8808232 we wanted to come out and give a great show for the fans and i think we did some great things on defense and some good things on offense
8808233 its a big ball game for this team and for south florida and an opportunity for us to go up there and play a great opponent
8808234 theyve got a tremendous offense tremendous defense and we feel great for the chance to go up there and play such a great team
8808235 things didnt happen the way we wanted but youve got to expect that out of any football game
8808236 especially when youre playing such a good opponent like miami
8808237 i put my teammates in positions that they could make plays not me
8808238 i learned if i could give the ball to my teammates everything will be ok i dont need to be the one going out there making spectacular plays

8808263 these microdomains are so tiny you could fit five million of them on a full stop there are 10 000 receptors on each cell and we are able to follow how single drug molecules bind to individual receptors in these specialised microdomains
8808264 what makes this single molecule laser technique unique is that we are looking at them in real time on a living cell other techniques that investigate how drugs bind to their receptors require many millions of cells to get a big enough signal and this normally involves destroying the cells in the process
8808265 this is the largest investigation to compare fracture rates in hiv infected patients with those of non infected controls

8808275 esperamos que la comunidad haga menos declaraciones de apoyo y que asuma su responsabilidad en este caso que la tiene y mucha
8808276 la comunidad sigue insistiendo en su voluntad de personarse porque tiene intereses directos en ese procedimiento
8808277 ellos lo plantean as porque piensan que la agresi n y la negligencia son dos casos distintos pero para nosotros la conexi n es evidente la situaci n de jes s es consecuencia de ambas cosas de la agresi n y de que no recibi la atenci n facultativa adecuada
8808278 cualquier dilaci n en el proceso va en contra del proceso
8808279 lo que hay abierto es un proceso por una denuncia de las agresiones salvajes al se or neira que es lo que ha provocado el estado en que se encuentra y en el que nosotros queremos ser parte porque nos parece un hecho brutal de agresi n que tiene que ser condenado
8808280 los m dicos nos han dicho que puede haber un desenlace en cualquier momento pero que hay alguna esperanza y tenemos que agarrarnos a ella

8808283 this week during a hearing of the special committee on water californians from throughout the state whose livelihoods depend on adequate water supply urged the state to step up and take the necessary steps to provide for this state s water needs today the assembly responded by passing sb 1xx which allocates funds desperately needed to provide relief from the current drought help stabilize the failing sacramento san joaquin bay delta and invest in water supply quality and reliability
8808284 this measure is a first step to providing californians throughout the state with a safe reliable long term water supply it is essential that we allocate these funds immediately in response to the state s most urgent needs
8808285 this bill is the first step to addressing california s long term water needs
8808286 sb 1xx gets money out the door so water agencies can tackle the most pressing problems boost supplies and improve water reliability for all californians
8808287 it has been 22 months since voters approved these bonds funds we need to get this money into our communities where it can do some good
8808288 this isn t a partisan issue it s not an urban agricultural or environmental issue it s not a north south or an east west issue this is money for emergency preparedness for drinking water quality for groundwater contamination cleanup and other critical projects that water agencies and experts throughout the state have supported and worked very diligently to put to work in communities throughout the state

8808290 because of the role hls5 plays in keeping cell growth at a normal rate we expect that these compounds will greatly slow down the growth of cancer cells this discovery is very encouraging and a great step forward in our quest to create new cancer treatments
8808291 our preliminary data reveals that several of these compounds do indeed markedly slow down the growth of human cancer cells
8808292 importantly we also know through computer modelling that nearly all of these compounds have drug like qualities
8808293 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases
8808294 the helicopter pad was sited between the inner security fence and the outer security fence and we had to make sure the whole thing went off smoothly
8808295 its happened about eight times since christmas when ive left flowers cards and little ornaments at his grave when it last happened on august 14 id put down flowers and a card and by the time i went back a couple of hours later to check theyd gone
8808296 its really really upsetting the people who are doing this are the lowest of the low
8808297 dave was a very kind loving man who was great fun a good man he never harmed anyone and wouldnt have hurt a fly he deserved respect but this is disrespectful
8808298 its hard to find the words to describe what its been like over the last year
8808299 ive tried to make daves grave look nice but its got to the stage where i feel i dare not put anything on it
8808300 i dont know why anybody would do this they should do something to stop it maybe cctv cameras
8808301 visiting a cemetery plot is a way of coping with loss and any theft from the graveside can very distressing
8808302 thankfully it is uncommon as the grounds are patrolled on a regular basis and every step is taken to ensure high maintenance standards within the grounds
8808303 we advise anyone who experiences any sort of vandalism or theft within the grounds of the cemetery to contact us and we will provide as much support as we can notifying the police if necessary
8808304 the little ones were scared three of them were crying we were trapped inside and had to wait for a few of the dads to come so we could get out in a group
8808305 they could not guarantee a response and could not guarantee the childrens safety in the community centre
8808306 many of the parents are outraged we are not as mad at the youths who did it as the police for not showing up at the time
8808307 i want to have faith that if i dial 999 an officer is going to come
8808308 these may be little things but its getting worse im worried what things are going to be like here when my children are old enough to go out alone
8808309 on a personal level i do think people are not confident in the police i do understand that they cover a wide area here but they are not putting enough resources into the police we need more bodies patrolling
8808310 theres no confidence for people to come out in the town after a certain time you could say people are living in fear
8808311 patrols have been up in the town recently and theres a lot going on that perhaps people dont see
8808312 its an age old problem this is a huge area and we have limited resources we can get a call to go to caldbeck then one to go to silloth with the best will in the world thats a 30 minute journey
8808313 in emergencies the control room will see where the nearest response is if it is maryport police they will be sent if it is carlisle police they will be sent we are constantly fighting for more staff we plead with the council to plead for more staff its probably the gripe of every station in the whole county
8808314 bessy beck is a good little fishery it is ideally situated with round ponds that make it easier to keep an eye on everyone
8808315 a lot of work goes into the event and i thank everyone for their support
8808316 my job on the day is to show our competitors how to use the rods and how to make the best of their fishing
8808317 we were really pleased to see alistair corps bell win awards at this event he loves to fish here because he finds it very accessible for his wheelchair
8808318 we are also grateful to him for his advice on how we can make bessy beck even more accessible in the future fingers crossed that there is sufficient sponsorship for the event to go ahead again next year
8808319 you get days that catch you today wasnt too bad but every now and again ill find myself talking and ill have to spread my legs a little further apart because i think i might be about to fall over
8808320 its that rule that you have to do three or maybe thats a rule that my agent invented
8808321 ive got a fairly high turnover anyway so realistically i probably would come up with 30 40 minutes of new material if i wasnt doing edinburgh but its the difference between doing that and an hour and not just an hour but an hour thats supposed to hang together as a show
8808322 my brother and i thought it was fantastic wed watched with our hands on the volume control in case mum and dad walked past us it became obvious very quickly that it wasnt wholesome humour
8808323 i used to learn jokes and tell them to people as a kid even if i didnt understand the jokes the kind of joke book jokes that dont make you laugh then i was babysitting and saw emo philips oh my god they were proper jokes i barely laughed it was so exciting
8808324 i think its really worth talking about but you run the risk of getting the wrong sort of attention
8808325 its awful but i think its happened three times where people have said they really like the racist stuff what racist stuff i make myself pretty clear that its not its really quite worrying i always ask if there are any muslims in i prefer it when there are and it doesnt feel like lets talk about them like theyre not in the room
8808326 it must be horrendous if youre a normal person and a muslim and you keep seeing on telly the loudest voice in islam is the most mental voice in islam
8808327 it must be like when your grandad tells a racist joke oh god hes one of us but i really wish he wasnt
8808328 probably about 10 minutes of it will be from the show maybe more
8808329 my brother is obsessed with vandalising pages about me he did a brilliant thing he went on the international movie database and started a page on me where he claimed that i had a massive collection of ladies hats then he used that page as a reference to alter my wikipedia page so its stayed on there
8808330 ive got two gigs tonight so im going to go home now and lie down for a bit i should be able to get a couple of hours before them
8808331 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8808332 the response to the festival has been unbelievable i think we could have staged a week long festival with the amount of acts who have applied to be part of it
8808333 we are great friends with ls lowry she is a lovely woman gorgeous
8808334 we are such superstars its in the public interest that we do this show
8808335 people say that i look about 26 i put it down to my range of fitness dvds and a facial exercise dvd called twitching with twizzle
8808336 her hair is so curly is it natural or do you perm it
8808337 can be a bit mad sometimes afterwards i can be a bit embarrassed by what i get up to on stage but the point about these songs and the reason why i love them is that you can really inhabit them my audience think im this feisty thing but im more eccentric i think
8808338 you should always push yourself as a performer to see how far you can go if youre scared of something thats usually what you should go towards
8808339 i feel its necessary to not just do things to please i sometimes worried about that in the past i thought if i dont want to alienate people i shouldnt perform but i would have given up if id stayed doing dietrich and piaf in a studied way that cafe cabaret version where youre making it easy instead of pushing yourself
8808340 if i study any more that might kill my love for it
8808341 it was the most extraordinary summer of my life and i thought i could spend the rest of my life singing this type of music
8808342 to do this right you have to be a better actress than a singer its all about the story
8808343 the accident was the thing that catapulted me to get up and do the things in my life
8808344 i was always scared to do performance full time before that when i had the accident i was a year out from everything learning how to walk and do the basic things i couldnt give a damn whether i could do architecture or not because at that stage youre happy to smell the flowers
8808345 that was when i realised what am i wasting my time for
8808346 when youre doing it every day it can be a bit exhausting but i need it
8808347 i am not that kind of person offstage im very reserved its like most actors its an excuse to be able to liberate yourself and liberate any reserve and i have plenty of that so i can see why im doing it
8808348 even if youre playing wonderful places such as sydney opera house youll always be that performer out there by herself like you were when you started all those years ago
8808349 its like youre constantly challenging yourself and you think if i stay at this another five years ill be different again so you just keep going
8808350 cette lection na jamais t mon sujet dit il elle a toujours t votre sujet
8808351 a lot of them were distressed when we found out what the city did because they didnt know if we were closing or if we are gonna keep up the same quality of service
8808352 its relieved a lot of the concern the seniors had
8808353 we picked up the phone and called them they were more than willing to help out
8808354 anything to help the community you know any help that anyone can give right now is very important
8808355 topeka lulac senior center is the number one provider of transportation services to seniors in topeka ks
8808356 with gas prices going up this year too we really felt the crunch
8808357 it is ironic that my grandfather and myself have been performing similar tasks so many years apart in the same part of the world
8808358 i know he served on the kyber pass which then ran between india and afghanistan because pakistan did not exist he was involved in looking for contraband goods and munitions all this time later we were seeking out roadside bombs
8808359 my grandad died when i was a teenager but i remember him being a very tough man he joined up for 10 years after world war one and then stayed on because there were no jobs in the great depression
8808360 when it came to the end of his second 10 years he had no choice other than to stay on because world war two was looming he spent an awful lot of his time serving abroad
8808361 it meant we were able to build up a real rapport with the locals there are very wealthy parts of kabul and very poor ones not much more than shanty towns people living there just want the basics of life they would like proper sewage systems power supplies that they can rely on and hospitals things that we take for granted we took on board their requests and passed them on but never made promises to them
8808362 i was never really felt frightened we were the only people doing foot patrols so we were able to get much closer to the local people
8808363 the younger ones were interested in our chocolate and supplies while older people wanted to know when they might see the end of sewage flowing down the streets
8808364 i got the impression that all they wanted was to live in peace
8808365 the afghans dont cause trouble it seems to come from over their borders
8808366 im really not sure what im going to do next what im really looking forward to doing is going out with my mates ive thought about joining the regular army in the past and im still 50 50 about that it would be great if we were doing tours of duty all the time
8808367 the little ones were scared three of them were crying we were trapped inside and had to wait for a few of the dads to come so we could get out in a group
8808368 they could not guarantee a response and could not guarantee the childrens safety in the community centre
8808369 many of the parents are outraged we are not as mad at the youths who did it as the police for not showing up at the time
8808370 i want to have faith that if i dial 999 an officer is going to come

8808375 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty
8808376 you can only have certainty about a fixed election date in the context of a majority government
8808377 look if any of the opposition parties wanted to provide some any degree of certainty that well be here to october 2009 then well have an election in october 2009
8808378 this prime minister is panicking inventing reasons to call an election and break his word

8808400 the democrats clearly have a hooligan problem it was as though their left wingers suffered a kind of karl rove envy they wanted to go on the attack demonize a clinton and hurl abuse at the clintons friends only a year ago vanity fair ran a cover story on how clinton hatred had infected much of the right wing the left seems to have grabbed the baton and it apparently did not dawn on the obama shock troops that they were offending the very people their man might someday need
8808401 im a gay man and so refer mrs ephron to one and when shes done making herself familiar with mcclurkin id like to point her toward you see there are other things that are important to me this isnt a one issue election and i have a very big problem voting for a candidate that uses anti gay bigots as part of their campaign regardless of the threat mccain may pose to
8808402 during the campaign you never heard bill clinton say about obama that he would have to think about supporting him and that his support would depend on his tone but you never heard hillary say that she would get baracks supporters but that she couldnt guarantee that he would get hers but frankly i dont think she owes barack another second of her time but guess what shell give it and gladly shes a better person than i am thats why i wanted to see her as president
8808403 today workers at invesco field are putting the final touches on the newest wonder of the modern political world the temple of obama the barackopolis it is upon this pulpit that barack obama will tomorrow night address thousands of screaming adoring fans there may be some confusion among the press about the venue and appropriate dress code for barack obamas big speech to help out we wanted to provide the following tips on appropriate attire the toga may have gone out of style centuries ago but after obamas temple speech tomorrow night theyre sure to be flying off the racks suggested toga styles the nobleman this toga is recommended for men for celebrities and lobbyists please add the red over toga one should expect to see such stars as ben affleck dress in red robes along with the lobbyists who fill invesco fields skyboxes

8808418 almost 40 percent of georgias eighth graders failed the standardized math test
8808419 but the validity of georgias tests was called into question this year eighty percent of sixth and seventh graders failed the social studies crct prompting georgia secretary of education kathy cox to throw out the score because they werent deemed trustworthy assessments of what was being taught
8808420 a typical first grader going to public school in chatham county takes seven to twelve standardized tests not including practice tests
8808421 nationally there is a rally cry against nclb no child left behind with education experts such as alfie kohn arguing that
8808422 michael moore a professor at georgia southern university in the department of curriculum says that testing in savannah schools is equal to a least one month of teaching
8808423 the parent coalition has met with the savannah chatham board of education and district superintendent thomas lockamy twice and insist they want to help the district in two areas to align student evaluation with the vision of the board of education
8808424 the coalition claims there is some sort of standardized test given in 70 out of 180 school days and because the stakes are so high teachers are forced to teach to the test teacher are in agreement that the pervasive testing culture not only affects teacher retention it is anti learning

8808427 it features people washing up on bondi beach wearing the striped bags and was a collaboration with mr faanana and mr fuata
8808428 there is a mix of m ori and pacific people who feature in the bags on the beach
8808429 we were trying to portray the notion of migration across the pacific arriving in new lands and having to learn a different language and culture
8808430 the plastic bags are iconic all over the world australians associate them with refugees samoan people use them to transport food m ori use them to take their bedding to the marae others for storage and in venice last year i saw them used for collecting rubbish
8808431 at the time of making this work australia was dealing with immigration issues boat people were landing on beaches in north australia and had been sent away unprocessed as refugees contrary to international law
8808432 back then there were about 26 000 m ori and 43 000 pacific people living in sydney we incorporated themes of cultural alienation dislocation and displacement experienced by immigrants into the work as well as a vision of a brighter future and survival of their cultures and communities

8808471 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8808472 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8808473 banning fifty and perfection is like a rite of passage for a mod
8808474 it was probably the most horrific event in our 102 year history
8808475 it is very heartwarming to see the support of our community come out tonight and we need to continue to feel that from you
8808476 this is the part that we need we need parents to be in our building we need them to be involved we need them to know their teachers we need them to come and see what were doing here at school so that we build that bond i think its very important
8808477 if you see something wrong you speak up this is your community
8808478 you need to love your kids and you need to take care of them then theyll take care of everybody else but if your parents dont love you and you dont care then thats how youre going to grow up in life youre not going to care and thats the biggest tragedy of this whole thing but maybe itll open up everybodys eyes a little bit and theyll do something about it
8808479 harmed us more than the money credit cards gift cards and identities she stole

8808481 over the past century neyland stadium has been continuously recognized as one of the best places in the nation to watch college football
8808482 neyland stadium coupled with the tradition of our football program here at tennessee continues to draw people from all over the country on saturdays in the fall we believe the master plan renovations will ensure it remains a thriving viable structure for generations to come
8808483 in november 2004 we unveiled the master plan for neyland stadium to serve as a long term solution to issues currently facing our stadium
8808484 these renovations will help prepare neyland stadium for the next 75 years of service to the volunteer nation

8808489 sen mccain likes to talk about judgement but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 of the time
8808490 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8808491 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8808492 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8808493 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8808494 that is like the best day of the whole year its the most fun to me its better than christmas i love coming here on opening day

8808526 such actions severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
8808527 the united nations urges restraint and calls for the immediate establishment of a humanitarian corridor so that the injured may be evacuated
8808528 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
8808529 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp there were many casualties

8808538 we were delighted last week with our a levels results and now we are equally delighted with our gcses
8808539 both the kids and the staff work very very hard if you want success you really have to work for it and at nelson thomlinson we try to engender that atmosphere
8808540 we are absolutely delighted i want to congratulate the pupils and the staff for all their hard work
8808541 last years results were a blip we have usually been around the 50 per cent mark but this is the first time weve been over 60 per cent

8808549 the proposed facility would be visible by only one property while to redevelop the existing would make it visible to at least 10 properties
8808550 we are happy to accept that after more than 25 years the existing plant does not meet current standards and will have no capacity for future development
8808551 in time the village of wreay will need some new housing to maintain the school and community the new plant will allow for this
8808552 the objectors have tried to suggest that the plans will spoil the village and are too close to the village pub
8808553 we have completely contradictory views in that the new site is well away from the village and nowhere near the pub while if the existing site is redeveloped it would in clear sight of and closer to the pub

8808561 i go to bed thinking about it and wake up thinking about it it is like a horror film
8808562 ive lived here for 10 years but there is a chance that ill be driven away by this that is assuming i could sell the house now
8808563 these turbines are going to be higher than dixons chimney in carlisle and im told the wing span of the blades will be similar to that of a 747 jumbo
8808564 they will be visible from all over the village so you can imagine what the view will be like from my house and garden which is my pride and joy the fight to prevent this development is dominating my life at the moment
8808565 you work hard for something then everything can suddenly change
8808566 im worried about the visual impact of the turbines and the noise nuisance but im really concerned about the constant flicker effect of the turning blades
8808567 almost all of the rooms in my home face west so there will be hours on end when the sun is shining behind them it will be going light dark light dark all the time
8808568 ill probably be forced to draw the curtains and sit in semi darkness but why should i have to do that this has been my home for 40 years
8808569 i dont know anyone in the village in favour of this windfarm i think letters of support have come from outsiders
8808570 at first look the cpis rise above 2 percent may be seen as a factor to prompt the boj to raise rates soon but as it has been saying that the impact of high oil prices will come off in the future
8808571 it is the downside risks to the economy that will make the boj hold fire
8808572 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8808573 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8808574 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8808575 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8808576 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8808577 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8808578 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8808579 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but it is not the change american needs
8808580 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8808581 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done

8808592 with the rise in commodity prices and the challenges raised with a weak economy consumer products companies are having to develop new strategies to remain successful
8808593 this could include rebalancing their product portfolios resizing packaging reformulating products and managing transportation costs as they try to rein in expenditures and curtail the necessity for price increases
8808594 despite an underlying first half margin of 4 65 earnings before interest and taxes we regard the fiscal year target of 4 8 5 3 as realistic
8808595 were still figuring that out but i can tell you this its not going to go down
8808596 we have a track record and all you have to do is see what weve done in the past to know what were going to do with this thing
8808597 were going to do what we do and market the expletive out of this and build it day by day the fighters are there too believe me were not new at this thing
8808598 our decision to engage was made in the last second as the russian tanks were rolling we had no choice
8808599 we took the initiative just to buy some time we knew we were not going to win against the russian army but we had to do something to defend ourselves
8808600 i got a call from the minister of defense that russian tanks some 200 were massing to enter tskhinvali from north ossetia
8808601 i ignored it at first but reports kept coming in that they had begun to move forward in fact they had mobilized reserves several days ahead of time
8808602 that theyd been called up three days before from places like moscow we had intelligence coming in ahead of time but we just couldnt believe it also in recent weeks the separatists had intensified artillery barrages and were shooting our soldiers id kept telling our guys to stay calm actually we had most of our troops down near abkhazia where we expected the real trouble to start i can tell you that if wed intended to attack wed have withdrawn our best trained forces from iraq up front
8808603 some months ago i was warned by western leaders in dubrovnik to expect an attack this summer
8808604 mr putin had already threatened me in february saying we would become a protectorate of russia when i met mr medvedev in june he was very friendly i saw him again in july and he was a changed man spooked evasive he tried to avoid me he knew something by then i ask everyone to consider what does it mean when hundreds of tanks can mobilize and occupy a country within two days just the fuelling takes that long they were on their way would we provoke a war while all our western friends are away on vacation be sensible
8808605 if america thinks it is too weak to do anything about georgia
8808606 you should understand how the russians see it how much moscow respects a strong united states or at least a u s that believes in its own strength
8808607 the warfare began aug 7 when georgia launched a barrage targeting south ossetia
8808608 that time will come one day youll see when we can all be friends

8808620 in forty five years i have never seen things so bad we did not manage ourselves well after the british departed but what we have now is something worse the revenge of the poor of the social failures of the people least able to bring up children in a modern society
8808621 the boys who took power in sierra leone come from houses like this
8808622 in three months these boys confiscated all the official mercedes volvos and bmws and willfully wrecked them on the road
8808623 in order to erase the humiliation and mitigate the power his middle class sponsors held over him
8808624 the government in sierra leone has no writ after dark
8808625 in the villages of africa it is perfectly natural to feed at any table and lodge in any hut but in the cities this communal existence no longer holds you must pay for lodging and be invited for food when young men find out that their relations cannot put them up they become lost they join other migrants and slip gradually into the criminal process
8808626 there is much less crime because islam provides a social anchor of education and indoctrination here in west africa we have a lot of superficial islam and superficial christianity western religion is undermined by animist beliefs not suitable to a moral society because they are based on irrational spirit power here spirits are used to wreak vengeance by one person against another or one group against another
8808627 a young woman with them who would go to the front naked always walking backwards and looking in a mirror to see where she was going this made her invisible so that she could cross to the armys positions and there bury charms to improve the rebels chances of success
8808628 in the 21st century france will be withdrawing from west africa as she gets increasingly involved in the affairs of europe frances west african sphere of influence will be filled by nigeria a more natural hegemonic power it will be under those circumstances that nigerias own boundaries are likely to expand to incorporate the republic of niger the hausa link the republic of benin the yoruba link and conceivably cameroon
8808629 prospects for a transition to civilian rule and democratization are slim the repressive apparatus of the state security service will be difficult for any future civilian government to control the country is becoming increasingly ungovernable ethnic and regional splits are deepening a situation made worse by an increase in the number of states from 19 to 30 and a doubling in the number of local governing authorities religious cleavages are more serious muslim fundamentalism and evangelical christian militancy are on the rise and northern muslim anxiety over southern christian control of the economy is intense the will to keep nigeria together is now very weak
8808630 we have a foreign policy today in the shape of a doughnut lots of peripheral interests but nothing at the center
8808631 on the threshold environmental changes as causes of acute conflict
8808632 neo malthusians may underestimate human adaptability in todays environmental social system but as time passes their analysis may become ever more compelling
8808633 as environmental degradation proceeds the size of the potential social disruption will increase
8808634 my father was a logger who thought about ecologically safe forestry before others
8808635 he logged planted logged and planted he got out of the business just as the issue was being polarized by environmentalists they hate changed ecosystems but human beings just by carrying seeds around change the natural world
8808636 we have to stop separating politics from the physical world the climate public health and the environment
8808637 for too long weve been prisoners of social social theory which assumes there are only social causes for social and political changes rather than natural causes too
8808638 think of a stretch limo in the potholed streets of new york city where homeless beggars live inside the limo are the air conditioned post industrial regions of north america europe the emerging pacific rim and a few other isolated places with their trade summitry and computer information highways outside is the rest of mankind going in a completely different direction
8808639 the worst degradation is generally where the population is highest the population is generally highest where the soil is the best so were degrading earths best soil
8808640 chinas fourteen percent growth rate does not mean its going to be a world power it means that coastal china where the economic growth is taking place is joining the rest of the pacific rim the disparity with inland china is intensifying
8808641 we will probably see the center challenged and fractured and china will not remain the same on the map
8808642 first differences among civilizations are not only real they are basic
8808643 second interactions between peoples of different civilizations are increasing these increasing interactions intensify civilization consciousness
8808644 the world of islam divides and subdivides the battle lines in the caucasus are not coextensive with civilizational fault lines the lines follow the interests of states where huntington sees a civilizational duel between armenia and azerbaijan the iranian state has cast religious zeal to the wind in that battle the iranians have tilted toward christian armenia
8808645 we are not in charge of the environment and the world is not following us it is going in many directions do not assume that democratic capitalism is the last word in human social evolution
8808646 we brought the village here but in the village we worked harder in the field all day so we couldnt fast during the holy month of ramadan here we fast here we are more religious

8808671 the fact that one can move with ease from vermont to miami has nothing to say about the consequences of vermont acquiring miamis climate
8808672 the educational system that had worked on the jews or the irish could no longer work on the blacks and when jewish teachers in new york tried to take black children away from their parents exactly in the way they had been taken from theirs they were shocked to encounter a violent affirmation of negritude

8808674 there are somethings we can say about god that make sense realtive to our understanding of things god is the foundation of all that is so we know that god cant be compared to anything else god is off scale for all atributes because god is the scale trying to measure and compare god to anything would be like trying to compare our single sun to the big bang even that is not apt because the bb was finite

8808863 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8808864 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8808865 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8808866 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos

8808881 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8808882 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8808883 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia

8808885 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8808886 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8808895 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
8808896 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
8808897 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8808898 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
8808899 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
8808900 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino

8808909 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8808910 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8808911 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8808912 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
8808913 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
8808914 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico

8809057 we havent played well that is all you can say about it we have not made all the effort we need to play well all the things that go into playing well we havent done once we get all our guys going i feel we will have a very strong defense
8809058 we would have liked to have a touchdown on that first one which was a little upsetting
8809059 we are a better country than this america we cannot turn back
8809060 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8809061 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8809062 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you for 18 long months you have stood up one by one and said enough to the politics of the past
8809063 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8809064 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8809065 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight on nov 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
8809066 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8809067 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8809068 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8809069 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8809070 have not served a red america or a blue america
8809071 i can look at a team that made the super bowl two years ago and won a playoff game in each of the last two years and say they got rid of a running back who is no longer productive shaun alexander and got three who were productive
8809072 i think its premature to say the window is closing i look around at that team and i say ok theres not really an area where i say man they are really weak are there teams that are more talented than seattle in the nfc not many
8809073 we know what green bay did to seattle last year
8809074 that would be the one area to me that would be a concern
8809075 the reality is if its a good game the person at home doesnt really remember who broadcast the game
8809076 i challenge people to tell me who was broadcasting a lot of the olympic events im honestly excited how we were going about it this year with more emphasis on the game
8809077 i am driven by lets go out and do the most complete broadcast we can for the person at home
8809078 and hopefully they enjoy it and like it and learn something about the teams they didnt know thats what drives me people who set out to create a legacy end up falling on their face
8809079 its tough because you are watching it on a screen and they producers are not telling you in your ear what play is going to come up
8809080 you have to be on your ps and qs and thats why it kept me so sharp because even when i was talking i had to look at what was happening and adjust
8809081 you can show us show us so theyre going to be very excited there are a handful of spots that will be determined by how the game goes
8809082 as an athlete i try to approach every game the same way you go out there do your best you prepare mentally and physically and try to take advantage of those opportunities you do get
8809083 i havent gotten too many so hopefully i get a few more in this game
8809084 its not my first go around so they kind of know what i can do
8809085 but ive still got to go out and prove myself every time im out there
8809086 you dont want to go out there and try to do too much and get outside of your game youve got to let it come to you
8809087 the raiders staff coached us at the senior bowl and i know some cal guys on the other side so it will be fun to see them
8809088 but its an opponent and ive got to make this team so im going to do whatever i can out there to show them i belong
8809089 there are depth positions and guys that still i would say its too close to call
8809090 because its so close if someone were to have a really good football game it would probably weigh the decision in that persons favor
8809091 hes a big strong guy but hes a little behind
8809092 we have try hard guys in there at defensive tackle but red has to come through
8809093 theres two ways to look at it one hes feeling better and i want him to feel good for the opener
8809094 but then the other side of the coin is he hasnt really played a competitive down he probably has to do that

8809103 when we choose a commander in chief this november we are electing judgment and character not years in the senate or years on this earth
8809104 time and again barack obama has seen farther thought harder and listened better and time and again barack obama has been proven right
8809105 when john mccain stood on the deck of an aircraft carrier just three months after barack obama saw even then an occupation of undetermined length undetermined cost undetermined consequences that would only fan the flames of the middle east
8809106 now let me ask you whose judgment should we trust
8809107 should we trust john mccains judgment when he said only three years ago afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded or should we trust barack obama who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to afghanistan
8809108 now after seven years of denial even the bush administration recognizes that we should talk to iran because thats the best way to advance our security
8809109 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8809110 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need

8809126 you know what weve got the wrong attitude about this and its partially our fault here are my ideas they wont be popular with my donors and i might not have as much power afterwards but what works is more important than appearances
8809127 i cant believe you made us knock on peoples doors we even had a friend with us then you started looking in peoples cars and describing what you saw that was weird it was so embarrassing
8809128 the process of getting acquainted which is such a delicate issue but of which we are often heedless should take place before marriage we should never be complacent about getting to know each other especially if were not sure of our feelings love should not blind us it should open our eyes to see the other person as he is with his faults someone once said that during the period of getting to know one another you should hold on to your heart firmly with both hands as if it were a wild animal you know how dangerous the heart is instead of leading you to marriage it can lead you to sin

8809159 but what i think is most interesting about this story is the way russia is asserting itself i dont know what was going through the georgian presidents head you dont attack russia with just 17 tanks he must have thought he had support from the u s and europe but what could the u s or europe do we know that the russians can cut off natural gas to europe anytime they want they have the energy we dont if they cut off the gas it will be a long cold winter for us and the united states putin knows that the u s is bogged down in iraq and he knows too that the u s doesnt have any money in geopolitics the country with the energy and the money wins and right now thats russia

8809169 wackernagel i hate to tell you this but if by the word reichsstrasse you folks mean something like superhighway the follow through on construction leaves something to be desired
8809170 you have to admit that it is much better than some of the rural roads we have traveled during the past two weeks in buchenland county
8809171 yep some of them were worse than anything id seen since about oh 1950 or 1960 in up time west virginia before the war on poverty thank god for four wheel drive

8809175 maybe gertrud oughta ride in the car with dagmar in case that she has you know female troubles or something cunz can ride the other horse
8809176 my lord commander this is gwen archer my flag lieutenant
8809177 i may have contacted the captain a time or two
8809178 on the other hand milady seven com calls in eight days does seem just a tad energetic
8809179 yes milady you did one would almost think that you were eager to get off world again surely theres something you could think of to do with your convalescent leave
8809180 on the other hand i really wasnt gone all that long and it wasnt particularly difficult to get things sorted back out after i got home and
8809181 i made it in time for the one thing i really wanted to do
8809182 mind you i missed the wedding along with all the rest of the star kingdom but at least i did make it home for raouls birth
8809183 in fact theyve endorsed your fitness report in very positive terms
8809184 although captain montoya did point out that youve been persistently less than completely candid shall we say about the amount of physical discomfort youre continuing to experience
8809185 montoya would have to be reporting something a lot more serious than a case of someone whos too stubborn to take the convalescent leave to which shes entitled before we worried about it at this point
8809186 im going to assume that what you mean is that youre relieved we have a command for you rather than that were so desperately pressed for personnel were cutting corners where medical considerations are concerned milady
8809187 forgive me milady im afraid my sense of humor has gotten itself a bit skewed over the last t year or so
8809188 the real reason ive been ducking your calls and i have been if im going to be honest is that weve had quite a problem deciding exactly what to do about that parole of yours no one here at admiralty house has any qualms about your having given president pritchart your parole especially under the circumstances that obtained
8809189 its more a matter of our needing to figure out which precedents apply which is what commander roach is here to explain to you
8809190 for fairly obvious reasons milady there werent any paroles during the last war and im afraid weve never set up the proper channels between us and the repulic since the fall of the committee of public safety either an oversight we ought to have rectified long since once we were rid of statesec unfortunately it would appear the previous government had other things on its mind such as it was and what there was of it and weve been just a bit busy outselves since baron high ridges departure so frankly weve been going around in circles over in the jags office trying to decide how to handle your case
8809191 public informations been dithering about it too im afraid because of all of the interstellar news coverage this whole summit meeting proposal has spawned given your close relationship to her majesty and the glare of publicity which has accompanied your return its particularly important that we get it right as i trust you understand
8809192 that the exact wording of your parole technically disqualifies you from active service anywhere until youve been properly exchanged on the basis that allowing you to serve somewhere besides directly against haven would still free up another officer for that service thats a very strict interpretation of the deneb accords however and its one the star kingdom has never formally accepted it was also frankly an interpretation that admiral cortez didnt much care for so i was asked to do some additional research probably because im currently the executive officer over at the charleston center for admiralty law
8809193 its supposed to be the highest place in pandah and
8809194 ill never get used to the cities you beast men live in
8809195 all those houses together and so many of them stone none of the true people ever built with stone
8809196 well you dont use fire so you cant smelt metal
8809197 and you catmen arent much interested in hard work either
8809198 i dont guess ill ever get used to cities either i was eighteen before i left barcas hamlet and it wasnt but three or four tens of houses
8809199 you are a friend of chief garric as you know the wizard tenoctris summoned me to help your spouse sharina while tenoctris herself was occupied with other business
8809200 even she says that and tenoctris isnt one to brag
8809201 it may be that with a wizard of his own race present and so powerful a wizard besides chief garric may no longer wish to keep me in his council do you believe that is so warrior cashel
8809202 look garrics job is fighting against well evil right the sort of evil thatll wipe out everybody your folk and mine both and the fight isnt over
8809203 a very great fight is coming i believe but you have tenoctris again
8809204 what with one thing and another ive been in a lot of fights ive never been in one where i wouldnt have welcomed help though i figure garric feels the same way
8809205 during the time i accompanied your spouse sharina warrior cashel i became accustomed to not being relegated to filth and garbage while i could return to my former life with the true people i dont feel the need to reinforce my sense of humility to that degree wholesome though no doubt it would be to do so
8809206 i told you the fight was not over warrior cashel
8809207 i felt but i did not say that chief garric would be wise to keep me by him i cannot do as much as his tenoctris does but i can do some things and he will need many things done if he and his kingdom our kingdom are to survive the coming struggle
8809208 would you mind staying here a little longer warrior cashel
8809209 i would like to work a small spell both our height above the ground and your presence will aid me i believe
8809210 and id appreciate you just call me cashel im not a warrior you know im just a shepherd
8809211 but i see what the world sees if you do not want me to say warrior i will not say the word but the truth does not change cashel
8809212 if loving you is wrong i dont want to be right
8809213 i cant go back either howard i i thought theyd uh done something to you so im afraid i beat up three of the station cops to try and get them to tell me where theyd taken you your cell was empty no sign of a forced exit
8809214 it was just a matter of time i guess ive been heading for trouble with everything i do
8809215 howard will you take me to this new eden of yours
8809216 its not that i dont like you its just new eden would kill you lani
8809217 i thought you said that they were gentle people who never killed anyone
8809218 but they do put people out of the airlock you can make peoples lives a misery too without actually killing or imprisoning them thats not what i meant lani its well we dont have any machines we wear clothes all the time we work every day except sundays for our food we eat meat real meat not this vat stuff a wife promises to honor and obey her husband she doesnt have as many men as she likes you would have to give up everything
8809219 so you do like me a little do you love me if you do i think i could do that
8809220 i dont think it would be right for me to ask that of anyone
8809221 i i like you i didnt mean to like you it is too early to speak of loving
8809222 we come from different worlds lani yours would kill me i think and mine would kill you
8809223 theyre past and i have to break this to you lani there is no way he can take you back where he comes from to do that youd need to go out of the other airlock this one will take us on not back and i dont think weve really got any choices theyll have been looking for kretz here some of those injured men will also be caught and talk probably ive taken things from the office and museum that are not supposed to be removed that i doubt if i could get back into place anyway lani would sit in jail for half her life howard here would be gelded kretz would die when he changed sex his companions will die if he doesnt get to them we havent really got many choices and who knows the next habitat on might be that world of your own now ive plotted a clear path shall we go
8809224 there is one person at the airlock well have to wait
8809225 we cant wait the police channel tells me theyre starting a systematic sweep we might be able to hide ourselves but not the vehicles we cant get far enough from them not to be found by the kind of search theyd start then ill leave howard with you let me go and deal with it
8809226 lets get the stuff out of the back and get in there the cops will be here any moment
8809227 spare ammunition clothes from the museum some tools i hear sirens lets try to run

8809230 you know ive cleverly inserted myself in the roll of the governors speakers
8809231 because we have an open seat in 2010 and the democrats feel this california governorship is theirs to be had this convention will be an important proving ground for the wannabes
8809232 we need to get tougher about drugs in our streets
8809233 we have important work to do outside the congress in order for us to have success inside the congress for the use of medical marijuana w e need peoples help to be in touch with their members of congress to say why this should be the case
8809234 entiendo que no soy el candidato m s probable para este puesto no encajo en el prototipo habitual y no he pasado mi carrera en los salones de washington
8809235 estoy ante ustedes por que en am rica se est sintiendo algo
8809236 lo que las personas negativas no entienden es que estas elecciones nunca han sido sobre mi son sobre vosotros
8809237 am rica somos mejores que estos ltimos ocho a os
8809238 este momento estas elecciones son nuestra oportunidad para mantener en el siglo xxi la promesa americana con vida
8809239 no es a causa de que a john mccain no le importe es por que john mccain no lo entiende
8809240 la semana que viene en minnesota el mismo partido que les ha tra do dos legislaturas de george bush y dick cheney pedir a este pa s una tercera
8809241 el 4 de noviembre debemos levantarnos y decir ocho es suficiente
8809242 a john mccain le gusta decir que seguir a bin laden hasta las puertas del infierno pero no llegar ni a la cueva donde vive
8809243 que dice acerca de su juicio el que est de acuerdo con bush el 90 por ciento de las veces
8809244 si john mccain quiere tener un debate sobre qui n tiene el temperamento el juicio de servir como el pr ximo comandante en jefe ese es un debate para el que estoy preparado asegur
8809245 somos el partido de roosevelt somos el partido de kennedy as que no me dig is que los dem cratas no defendemos este pa s
8809246 como comandante en jefe nunca vacilar a defender esta naci n pero s lo enviar a nuestras tropas al peligro con una misi n clara y un compromiso sagrado de darles el equipamiento que necesitan en la batalla y el cuidado y las ventajas que merecen cuando vuelven a casa
8809247 terminar la lucha contra al qaeda y los talib n en afganist n
8809248 no se que tipo de vidas cree john mccain que tienen las celebridades pero esa ha sido la m a
8809249 esos son mis h roes sus abuelos esas son las historias que me formaron y por ellos pretendo ganar estas elecciones
8809250 the goal is to galvanize the sustainable food movement and bring it to the masses
8809251 food is love so how do we make it not just a privilege but a right
8809252 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8809253 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8809254 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8809255 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8809256 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8809257 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8809258 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8809259 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8809260 lets be honest america mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes but we are the ones who will pay for his flip flops
8809261 we are making a down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
8809262 we proved that a dream still burns in the heart of every american
8809263 on this day exactly 45 years ago my father stood on the national mall in the shadow of abraham lincoln and proclaimed i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8809264 let us give our nation a leader who has heard this clarion call and will help us achieve the change
8809265 like george bush john mccain suggests spending 10 million in iraq barack obama and joe biden believe we ought to bring the war in iraq to a responsible end
8809266 barack obama and joe biden know that this is not just about turning red states blue its about turning our country around
8809267 the mayors program celebrates health and recreation in san francisco as a sponsor of sunday streets were excited to tell the community about the national park in their backyard
8809268 with miles of trails and bike lanes and nearly 1 000 acres of open space the presidio has so many opportunities to explore and enjoy
8809269 trato de dejar todo no me gusta perder en cada partido me mato para que las cosas le salgan bien al equipo si concreto el objetivo soy el hombre m s feliz del mundo
8809270 el equipo me dej una agradable imagen en el debut a pesar de haber perdido 3 a 2 con independiente
8809271 pancho se acerc y me felicit por el buen juego que tuvimos viniendo de un hombre como el es importante para nosotros estamos haciendo bien las cosas

8809275 finland which does not resort to such practices has the worlds best schooling system by most benchmarks
8809276 the amount of money going into the system and hence overall teacher renumeration
8809277 we fix the school system by using money to renumerate the teachers
8809278 but theres no structural aspect in the finnish education system which creates good educational outcomes in a causal sense except possibly having well educated teachers and a well funded system except that teachers arent all that well paid

8809283 a woman must learn to be a housewife even if she has a formal education she should learn to cook to sew to embroider but my good father you may say that is all self evident ask married couples however and youll see how many women who are about to marry know nothing about running a household once we reach a certain age moreover the choice of ones life partner is a matter which should not be put off neither should one be in a hurry because as the saying goes quick to marry quick to despair but one should not delay because delay is a mortal danger to the soul as a rule the normal rhythm of the spiritual life begins with marriage an unmarried person is like someone trying to live permanently in a hallway he doesnt seem to know what the rooms are for

8809295 la sequ a es tremenda lo que provocado que los animales pierden muchos kilos de peso y tambi n que muchos de ellos hayan muerto
8809296 llevamos siete meses sin agua en una poca donde es fundamental contar con el l quido tanto para que los campos desarrollen sus pasturas como para que los animales tengan para beber
8809297 tengo colegas que han perdido todo su ganado entre 10 000 y 15 000 animales porque no solo faltan lluvias sino que en el subsuelo tampoco hay agua
8809298 si tuvi ramos represas podr amos guardar agua en las pocas de grandes precipitaciones para cuando tengamos faltantes pero las obras no existen

8809304 in survivors treatment in these preterm babies did reduce the risk of cerebral palsy
8809305 we think it should be out there for consideration for obstetricians to use for the treatment of women who are delivering early
8809306 although promising we would advise caution because of the differences
8809307 better understanding is needed of factors that might influence the likelihood that offspring will benefit from maternal magnesium sulfate treatment such as the reason for imminent preterm birth the dose of magnesium sulfate and the timing of administration
8809308 well be able to see what works and what doesnt under field conditions
8809309 things that look promising under controlled laboratory conditions dont necessarily pan out in the real world sonoma county has an incredibly varied topography and multiple microclimates large plains and steep mountains cool coastal regions and hot inland interiors we can provide the scale needed to identify the truly practical systems and winnow out the inferior ones
8809310 we have another reservoir over there holding about the same amount that should provide all the capacity we need
8809311 until now this was something of an alternative technology that an ambitious handyman in the midwest might use to reduce the heating and cooling costs in his home
8809312 but by scaling up the process and turning to water as a heat sink were showing you can use these systems for large commercial industrial and residential developments and as you scale up your savings in energy and reductions in carbon emissions become dramatic
8809313 the sonoma plan is looking very very attractive to me
8809314 geothermal heat pumps are not a new technology but the proposal to utilize them on this scale is new it points to a ramping up of the technology that ultimately could make a huge difference
8809315 ultimately their advice allowed us to go from a general idea to on the ground projects that could change the global economy
8809316 water essentially is publicly owned and as a result there is no regulatory agency pushing energy efficiency
8809317 water has been insulated from the pressures that the utilities and developers have felt in california the public debate over water has centered on the impact water development has had on fisheries particularly in the sacramento san joaquin delta but the other great environmental impact of water the energy required to move it around and the atmospheric carbon that energy consumption addressed
8809318 thats why the water agencys target of zero net carbon water delivery is so compelling
8809319 first it speaks to a major element of the greenhouse gas problem that hasnt ever been addressed second it can really work it doesnt necessarily require technology we dont have if the steps theyre proposing are fully implemented they should be able to achieve their goal
8809320 the main framing point here is that we have a lot of approaches that individually are promising but we have to determine their collective efficacy
8809321 personally i think theyll make a big impact but we need to start scaling up now we need to get moving
8809322 but i think the primary thing is that a person clicks on a computer clicks on a youtube video and then its him and video and its his choice that he they can oppose pause it i think the intimacy and ownership of the event is better and more connected to the viewer
8809323 this is connecting to them almost viscerally through technology which is good and but if you you know especially is a kind thing that
8809324 what this shows is that you can go directly from one type of adult cell to another without going back to the beginning
8809325 you could say for example its like turning a scientist into a lawyer without sending her all the way back to kindergarten
8809326 meltons work is going to inspire an explosion of experiments in directing the fate of tissues in one way or another in ways that may be more practical than having to reprogram them back to pluripotency
8809327 el ca averal y el lapacho son elementos que caracterizan a nuestra tierra generosa y son im genes recurrentes en las obras que estudiamos para armar este recital

8809337 australian manufacturers and workers union national print secretary steve walsh said the union was monitoring the situation but his members would keep working
8809338 you cant go to the past to fix the present
8809339 sometimes you have to be sad to remind yourself that youre alive
8809340 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8809341 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8809342 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8809343 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8809344 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8809345 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8809346 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8809347 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president

8809358 as a staff were really interested to see how much progress weve made since last year its been 12 months of hard work to see how were doing the players are ready to play this is where the rubber meets the road theyre just excited to get out and get playing
8809359 it is a long way but we had a good flight and we left ourselves time to rest up and get ready for friday
8809360 the bigger challenge is going to be playing two very good teams on the road and in their environment its very hot out here and friday is supposed to be the same doing it on a friday sunday format will test our fitness and depth there are a couple of things that well find out about our team right away
8809361 we know some of the players from the recruiting process and from what weve heard about the history of northridge and we know they have a good background
8809362 we havent looked too much to fullerton yet but northridge is a team that is very capable of being in the ncaa tournament this year
8809363 multi cultural game development is a major theme when you are talking about a region such as the asia pacific
8809364 with the number of international companies we are presenting as well as some confirmed world exclusive premieres we are confident this years gca and gcac will eclipse last years show in terms of knowledge exchange and importance on a global level

8809367 en el caso del distrito federal la asamblea informativa se desarrollar en el monumento a la revoluci n el pr ximo domingo
8809368 raro ser a que despu s de 26 a os sin crecimiento econ mico sin empleos sin bienestar social no hubiese inseguridad y violencia
8809369 aqu en nuevo le n han tenido la desgracia de tener a gobernadores salinistas adem s son muy rateros as sean del pri o del pan por ejemplo elizondo cuando fue senador aprob todo los acuerdos para comprar el gas natural en el extranjero y por eso los mexicanos tenemos que pagar m s por este servicio que en otros pa ses del mundo
8809370 no s calder n result ser un in til no s lo porque no tiene autoridad moral sino que se ha revelado como un inepto
8809371 ya no le dicen felipe sino lipe porque ya le perdieron la fe
8809372 no vamos a permitir la privatizaci n del petr leo
8809373 aunque haya un desgaste pol tico aunque afecte nuestra imagen nosotros no dejaremos sin porvenir al pueblo de m xico
8809374 porque para frenar este problema se debe de cambiar la actual pol tica econ mica y combatir la corrupci n
8809375 si queremos que haya tranquilidad paz social en el pa s tiene que haber mejores condiciones de vida y de trabajo para millones de mexicanos
8809376 se or felipe calder n quieres acabar con la delincuencia acaba primero con tu gabinete corrupto
8809377 se or felipe calder n guerra y ejecuciones si tu gabinete sigue protegiendo a delincuentes como joaqu n guzm n ignacio coronel la familia oscar valencia o ismael mayo zambada
8809378 quieren que se termine la violencia dejen de proteger a el chapo guzman mayo zambada nacho coronel por traidor oscar valencia el chaparro los michoacanos el chango m ndez gentes protegidas por los comandantes de los cuarteles de sinaloa michoac n y sonora los generales de brigada rolando eugenio hidalgo eddi rafael de jes s ballesteros topete y rafael garc a aguilar respectivamente
8809379 el gobierno federal quiere acabar con la delincuencia cuando ellos mismos encubren a cambio de sumas millonarias desde hace siete a os a joaqu n guzm n loera el chapo oscar valencia ignacio coronel el coronel ismael zambada el mayo la familia mart n cordero luque o general de sonora encargado de darles protecci n a estos narcotraficantes acaso esta es la lucha contra el crimen
8809380 se or narco presidente si quiere que se acabe la inseguridad deje de proteger a los narcotraficantes como el chapo guzm n ismael el mayo zambada la familia michoacana y a los mandatarios partidistas que igual que usted son narcos como los anteriores que llevan 40 a os como narco mandatarios
8809381 si quieren que se acabe la inseguridad en el pa s tu calder n deja de proteger a los narcos al chapo al mayo al nacho al coronel el esparragoza a la familia michoacana y a los mandatarios partidistas que igual que ellos son narcos que ya llevan m s de 40 a os de ser narco mandatarios
8809382 una estrategia pol tica de acci n nacional que tiene un trasfondo m s que criminal
8809383 no se vale tampoco extrapolar o extralimitar eventos que se castigan con toda la fuerza de la ley y que se combaten con toda determinaci n tratando de usurpar iniciativas de la sociedad para escupir hacia arriba
8809384 les encantar a que no viniera el turismo y que estuvi ramos desolados y que no fu ramos a tener visitas tan importantes y que se llenara el puerto cada semana pero eso no va a ocurrir porque nosotros estamos cumpliendo con nuestro deber
8809385 esas mantas tienen que ver con estrategias pol ticas y est n aprovechando actores pol ticos de acci n nacional para atacar al gobierno de fidel herrera beltr n no obstante que ha sido el principal motor de un sistema de seguridad
8809386 creo que no hay nadie de la delincuencia que se atreva a estar fijando esas mantas y menos en la capital del estado o en poza rica donde hay una gran actividad para preservar la paz y la tranquilidad pol tica
8809387 pues no s lo demuestran la incapacidad del responsable de la pol tica interna de veracruz sino la falta de actos de gobierno para acabar con el crimen organizado que se asent en esta administraci n estatal
8809388 sr presidente si quiere que termine la inseguridad deje de proteger a los narcotraficantes como el chapo guzm n ismael el mayo zambada la familia michoacana
8809389 sr presidente si quiere que termine la inseguridad deje de proteger a los narcotraficantes como el chapo guzm n ismael el mayo zambada la familia michoacana y los mandatarios partidistas que al igual que usted son narcos como los anteriores ya que llevan 40 a os de narcomandatarios

8809391 para que toda la ciudadan a est enterada esta guerra no comenz hace 20 a os si no hace siete a os cuando un gobierno corrupto y funcionarios vendidos protegieron las organizaciones de guzm n loera nacho coronel mayo zambada por gente vendida como el general genocidio loera y el federal cesareo carvajal
8809392 we started this the very first year i took over as head coach
8809393 it goes a long way towards team unity the players get to know each other better and bond more
8809394 team gatherings help us to be on the same page off the field just like were on the same page on the field
8809395 eating pasta is like scoring goals it looks great but tastes even better
8809396 this year is the first year where the weather has been real nice
8809397 st joes was just too serious we would never have had anything like a team spaghetti dinner
8809398 this is a lot of fun it brings everyone together off the field so we can get to know each other better i like it
8809399 the rotary club is especially pleased to have john beilein agree to agree to be part of our fundraiser as the featured speaker at this dinner
8809400 of course the event is being held primarily for the benefit of the lockport family ymca
8809401 im excited to be back coaching in lockport and we look forward to our upcoming season
8809402 we hope to finish as league champs and make it to the sectional finals this year
8809403 thats a tough way to open but the girls are working hard and were looking to improve with each game
8809404 we got our butts beat and all the credit goes to the university at buffalo
8809405 its a great win to show that our program is moving forward definitely in the right direction
8809406 you enjoy it but you cant get too excited about one football game were teaching them how to handle success thats huge right now how we handle prosperity
8809407 drew just threw it up there and i went and got it
8809408 the offensive line did a great job protecting me and opening holes for james and brandon id like to give the glory to them
8809409 this has gone on for a couple years sometimes you sustain x amount of pain for so long before deciding its just not worth it
8809410 in the spring we were impressed by his toughness in the week he practiced before getting hurt
8809411 he brings some violence to the position hes an explosive get off the ball kind of guy hes very tough we like those kind of guys
8809412 those kind of guys have an impact on the guys around them
8809413 i think as he continues to play more hell continue to improve and adapt
8809414 hes a competitor and hes going to fight and scrap you have to have guys like that
8809415 now we havent played a game yet and hes going to have some growing pains in games but based on practice hes a very good football player with a tremendous amount of upside the type of guy who could be a four year starter in the program
8809416 you see the disappointed looks at preseason games on young guys that havent had many opportunities to play now they get a chance to play this is their game
8809417 so theyre going to be very excited theyre playing for their dream so its very important
8809418 every play you have to play like it is your last in the nfl
8809419 so i am going out taking it serious and leaving no doubt that i belong here and trying to make it a tough decision for them that is my goal for this game go out and make plays and be productive and make no mistakes
8809420 quarterbacks are good but they are going to put you out there every once in a while it is just unfortunate that it was in the preseason and i am in the situation i am in fighting for a spot
8809421 but no excuses i am going to have opportunities this next game and i have had lots of opportunities in practice to make plays so i am going to look forward to those
8809422 coutu has been hurt a little bit and that hasnt helped him it allowed mare to really show hes clearly got a strong leg can kick it in the end zone which is a good weapon but its close
8809423 theres definitely a little bit of hurdles in the beginning
8809424 you definitely dont get as many reps but when youre in there you have to definitely make yourself known with those reps that you get a lot of it is on special teams right away to see your athleticism eventually if you get yourself established a little bit you get your fair share i think they give everybody a shot
8809425 i definitely thought i played well enough to get some looks and possibly some scholarships most every player does i guess
8809426 i was fairly confident in my abilities but sometimes it just doesnt work out the recruiting process is a big deal i didnt get a chance to do some camps that i would have liked to i had a little bit of an injury going into my senior year i had to go with another plan and it worked out
8809427 and im going to try to work my hardest and see what happens
8809428 donald has had a big role and he did a great job during the summer time
8809429 mason foster played as a freshman but hes still a young player and working through that and josh gage plays as well i dont have major concerns josh gage is a guy we trust a lot he does what hes supposed to do when hes supposed to do it
8809430 from the very beginning ive tried to work my hardest study my hardest and try to be the best that i can be what you can control
8809431 that helped me along with some of the hurdles that maybe a walk on gets but when youre in there in individual drills always try to get better and i still try to take that approach right now just because my name is on top of the depth chart doesnt necessarily mean anything im just trying to become a better player and help the team as best i can
8809432 they really havent fallen off in any races theyve got the money to keep throwing new parts at the car and they keep running good plus donny is a really strong driver
8809433 but i think we can catch them we just got to keep getting a little bit each and every night
8809434 we started hot but in the last two months things have really come together for us its the culmination of the team we built coming along and getting some success
8809435 its taken us a few years to get everything built the way we want it built and get the right people in place now that weve added the right people we are seeing the success on the track like we always knew we would
8809436 its a smaller track which means you get a lot of lapped traffic the neat thing is its a high speed track even though its shorter it lends itself to great passing and great racing
8809437 in the world of outlaws things have got to go your way
8809438 im happy getting good finishes because the crew works so hard that they deserve them were going to keep doing what were doing and hopefully we can chase down the championship
8809439 this is where the territory would go forward and make its claim that we have met the corrective actions so we can get out of these administrative sanctions
8809440 i was very pleased to meet with the acting governor and learn about his commitment leadership and dedication to improving the efficiency and service of the usda nutrition assistance programs to the people of guam
8809441 i gave them an update of where we were at
8809442 were no longer months behind were now up to date
8809443 one of the concerns that they had with the sanctions was that we really didnt have the infrastructure in place to address our processing with our backup servers and our other it equipment
8809444 im very happy to say that theyve taken that away from the administrative sanctions because weve made a lot of improvements
8809445 this is certainly another challenging schedule for our team one that will get us prepared for big 12 play and hopefully have us playing some of our best basketball at the end of the season
8809446 there are obviously some tremendous tests on this schedule but with a number of home games our fans will have a chance to come see this team develop and mature throughout the year
8809447 i feel comfortable with where were at as a team
8809448 ive been very happy with our progress we had a lot of goals set for this time you know prior to the regular season and we accomplished a whole bunch of them
8809449 we wouldve liked to have started faster and not given them the scores
8809450 they sustained some good drives and ran the ball on us but what i was happy with was we settled down and stopped them i just really liked how our team played from then on
8809451 like ive said all along i told coach linehan as little or as much as you want to play me
8809452 every day in the gulf coast league youre liable to see something youve never seen before
8809453 every day in the gulf coast league youre liable to see something youve never seen before
8809454 banks should treat scottish customers more favourably than their english counterparts because the housing market in scotland is more resilient the snp housing minister has said
8809455 los responsables de esta maniobra dijo la funcionaria son intensamente buscados y en las pr ximas horas se producir an detenciones
8809456 mi marido estaba charlando con marcos holman t cnico de la quinta cuando hay una jugada que pod a derivar en penal para rivadavia pero el rbitro no lo cobr entonces juan carlos le reclam la falta y all empez todo
8809457 apenas lo escuch una persona de unos 35 a os que despu s supimos se trataba del padre de un chico de la quinta divisi n de mariano moreno que estaba jugando en ese momento le reproch a mi esposo que le reclamara al rbitro lo que deriv en un cambio de palabras hasta que esta persona lo desafi a pelear afuera del estadio
8809458 y se fue para los vestuarios a saludar a los chicos entonces un padre de rivadavia le avis que ese hombre lo estaba esperando afuera y se lo ve a muy exaltado por lo que no era conveniente que saliera enseguida
8809459 pero juan carlos no le hizo caso y sali rumbo al micro con los chicos entonces este hombre lo invit a pelear en una placita que hab a enfrente como l no le hizo caso llam a un grupo de no menos de 25 chicos de las inferiores del club local que estaban all munidos de ca os palos y cadenas quienes lo encerraron en una calle lateral estrecha y empezaron a golpearlo
8809460 yo me qued paralizada porque los pibes que no ten an m s de 14 o 15 a os le pegaban brutalmente a mi esposo mientras este hombre los arengaba en un momento pens que lo mataban porque la gente de rivadavia que hab a acompa ado a los equipos tard en darse cuenta de la situaci n e intervenir
8809461 despu s de un rato que pareci eterno pudieron intervenir algunos padres para defender a juan carlos lo que deriv en una batalla campal pasaron como diez minutos hasta que llegaron algunos polic as para dispersarlos y cuando corr hacia mi marido lo vi con la cara y la cabeza destrozadas
8809462 tiene cinco puntos de sutura en la cara le arrancaron dos dientes de ra z un golpe terrible con una cadena entre el hombro derecho y el cuello un corte profundo en la cabeza por un ca o y en el brazo izquierdo por un palazo
8809463 la verdad que no hicimos la denuncia policial porque no quisimos complicar al club aunque nos dijeron que se va a actuar de oficio la que tendr que intervenir ser la propia liga para castigar a los responsables y sobre todo hacer algo para que esto no se repita
8809464 el tema de la inseguridad se debe abordar no s lo desde una perspectiva de derechos humanos sino tambi n desde la eficacia
8809465 tampoco podemos poner en situaci n de desequilibrio a la provincia le pido a los gremios que abran las puertas de las aulas y dejen de poner a los chicos en situaci n de rehenes involuntarios
8809466 i didnt plan to have total turnover right away but i like it
8809467 theyre all my style of players very high skilled players all around players
8809468 we all click very well because were all in the same boat
8809469 i think its the people on our team that make us so close not just our ages
8809470 i think its coming at a good time we have a lot of guys back and it gives us an opportunity to practice with a lot of people and it gives us an opportunity to play with two of our new guys
8809471 were going to try and get them as much playing time as we can and try to use it as an introduction to get them up to speed
8809472 the trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt
8809473 the cure for boredom is curiosity there is no cure for curiosity
8809474 if you want to build a ship dont drum up people together to collect wood and dont assign them tasks and work but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea
8809475 always recognize that human individuals are ends and do not use them as means to your end
8809476 assuming that one estimated the value of a piece of music according to how much of it could be counted calculated and expressed in formulas how absurd would such a scientific estimation of music be
8809477 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
8809478 if you possess a thousand contradictory aphorisms you have knowledge if you know when to apply each one you have wisdom
8809479 the man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the cooperation or consent of his deliberate reason to such a man the world tends to become definite finite obvious common objects rouse no questions and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected as soon as we begin to philosophize we find that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given
8809480 as long as the world shall last there will be wrongs and if no man objected and no man rebelled those wrongs would last forever
8809481 no man is free who is not master of himself
8809482 i have no special talent i am only passionately curious
8809483 a designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add but when there is nothing left to take away
8809484 those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities
8809485 be the change that you want to see in the world
8809486 i have not failed ive just found 10 000 ways that wont work
8809487 i paint objects as i think them not as i see them
8809488 football is a game of field position and a blocked punt is bad
8809489 its a huge game changing play weve got to get it corrected for next week against philly
8809490 at least now we know what we what we have to work on
8809491 we have to try to make plays and change games in order to do that you have to be in the right spot
8809492 if one guy gets out of place its like a domino effect it could be any one of us we all take the blame for it
8809493 he kind of bull rushed me i opened up my shoulder a little bit and he just nicked
8809494 theres 11 guys on the field and if one person breaks down it can mess up the whole play
8809495 youve got to contend with mother nature everythings got to be working
8809496 were going to have to really tighten up were giving up way too many yards on returns
8809497 you want to use the preseason to build momentum and carry on into the regular season
8809498 but if youre having ups and downs this is definitely the time to do it
8809499 my maintenance man radioed me and said they came and looked at the dumpsters and just left
8809500 right now there are certain things that are not allowed in the dump and pacific waste would not pick up our things because we had some cardboard boxes sticking out
8809501 we called the company and they told us these are the things they are not going to take so we need to make sure that what we are putting in is appropriate
8809502 from now on we have to start putting the cardboard aside
8809503 but i havent looked into that i dont read that stuff i dont know the system and how it works
8809504 he can do anything he wants athletically and hes grown up so much since he got here
8809505 hes poised to have a great year coach ron zook will tell you hes as good an athlete as hes seen in the secondary ever he certainly holds his own ticket now he has to put it all together
8809506 i want him to be the best he humanly genetically can be and ill hold him to that standard
8809507 sometimes it takes a little wake up call i want him to be perfect but its something that we made a deal when i recruited him and he forgot it
8809508 he knows if he has to do that to get me playing
8809509 thats what coaches do i feel hes going to push and take you where you dont think you can go i never thought id be up for the type of awards i am only coach zook knew that
8809510 i dont have any issues with that what he has to understand is lets worry when its time to worry not now the more he does to help this team the better its going to help him
8809511 with my brother being a role model he expects a lot from me if youre a younger brother thats the toughest position to be in
8809512 his challenge is to play every snap as hard as he can
8809513 and to go from being a great athlete to a great player
8809514 based on some of the elements tonight and the plan to play the backups a lot anyway we went ahead and went with it
8809515 im glad we did it because i think these guys deserved these extra snaps to give them close to a full days work gives us a lot more to look at here weve got some tough decisions to make
8809516 hes had a similar sprain before and hes a young guy should bounce back quickly from it he was moving around on the sideline the doctor felt it was very stable and everything
8809517 i dont have one we are running plays like they do in high school
8809518 my first year in professional baseball was my first year away from home and i began to appreciate what theyd done here why theyd left havana
8809519 we had a two story home there my father had a good job my mother didnt work but communism was coming and they saw what that might have meant for their future and mine
8809520 i didnt play baseball until i was 13 and then i was in one of the latin leagues in miami playing for the cubanitos little cuban
8809521 former cuban players coached us and i think my parents paid 10 a month so i could play that was a lot of money then for them and they were both working
8809522 every kid who signs a minor league contract has the same dream to reach the big leagues not everyone can i never got the opportunity though i came close
8809523 in 1984 i was in denver playing for the white soxs triple a team and it looked like i was going go be called up for september
8809524 our team swept a four game series and got into the minor league playoffs and we played 12 days into september by the time we were done the white sox decided there was no sense bringing me up for 2 1 2 weeks that was the closest i got until 23 years later
8809525 i worked my tail off as a player i wasnt that talented
8809526 in 1990 i retired as a player and the expos asked if i wanted to coach i was ready i stopped playing and began as a hitting coach
8809527 i got to know a lot about hitting by failing some great hitters cant teach what they did because they never really failed and most hitters do all the way through my career i learned as a player and as a coach
8809528 did i help players get to the majors i gave as much time and effort to every player i ever coached and if they made it it was because of them not me
8809529 i didnt know him but special assistant to bill bavasi john boles recommended him and pedro grifol the mariners coordinator of minor league instruction knew him and liked him
8809530 we interviewed about six candidates and offered the job to jose he had so much experience working with hitters and other coaches
8809531 i was in single a high desert fixing a batting cage when pedro grifol called and he said hey nachi where you going next
8809532 so i did i checked into the warwick hotel and lee pelekoudas called and offered me the job of big league hitting coach
8809533 it was very emotional for me thinking about it now it still is
8809534 i called my wife lisa my kids my parents there was a lot of laughing and crying on the phone id been in the game so long
8809535 it took me 31 years to get to the majors my first day in a big league uniform thats something ill take to my grave
8809536 hes very knowledgeable hes had a lot of experience doing this he has a lot to offer the hitters
8809537 hes a coach who doesnt overdo mechanics but he can look at a video and see the problem
8809538 even on the field songs are going through my head
8809539 youd be amazed how i play with songs going through my head thats how i play
8809540 if you listen to me record i speak with a lot of aggression
8809541 hes just a mouth out there and sometimes it gets in your head
8809542 hes developed into being a real good safety and has big play ability
8809543 hes just trying to be the best he can and hell let other people worry about comparisons if he does that hell be a pretty good safety
8809544 i used to wonder why he got on my tail for the smallest things but he saw something in me and kept pushing thats why i came back
8809545 my environment was around a lot of drugs and crime and i started getting involved in stuff like that
8809546 if im in the dorm laying down i love writing
8809547 i can write about anything it was a gift i had given to me because i can make anything rhyme i sit in meetings and grab a beat and a teammate starts beating on the table and i start rapping it definitely lightens the mood music is beautiful
8809548 its kind of nice getting the world perspective i go to a nice university in st louis and its eye opening to go to a different country and see the poverty other people live in eighty percent of the people there dont make more than a thousand dollars a year people make more than that in a week here its hard to see that but its rewarding you come back here and can be thankful for the things you have
8809549 i already wanted to do something like this he said
8809550 i dont think you can survive without playing down there he said joining the locals in a game called fulbito a five a side game similar to indoor soccer played on a concrete court
8809551 theyre falling on the concrete floor all the time and they just get up and keep playing nothing hurts them a big thing i learned there is playing through pain
8809552 the things he does outside soccer are amazing to me we use him as an example when we talk to kids about preparing for down the road
8809553 hes a solid presence on the field theres nothing in particular statistically to point to his energy his effort his passion to play his ability to go into tackles hard and win the ball in the defensive third of the field those can make a difference in a game
8809554 if we face them again wed always have the chance to sweep and make three games up
8809555 take a day off thursday and try to win the series in houston period
8809556 you consider weve had five good months and now you try to sprint in september and have six good months thats the mark of a good club then we can say were a good club well see where we end up
8809557 we needed to win wednesdays game i wont go so far as to say its a must win because there is no must win until youve got only a few to play or youre about to be eliminated but this was a way better off if we did win game because were way better off that we did
8809558 i think theyre very good theyve got to play the cubs a few times but weve got to win games period
8809559 twenty eight is that how many weve got left then weve got to win 28 games
8809560 if elected her husband would attempt to grant amnesty to every illegal alien in the united states
8809561 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
8809562 when you step on that field you know this could be the game where you die literally every time you step onto that field youre putting your life at risk or someone elses life at risk thats why i didnt smile this is serious serious stuff
8809563 well we cant pay you that kind of money look how much your stats went down last year when you played hurt
8809564 los ruidos parec an como los que producen las garras de un animal cuando rasgu a las paredes
8809565 seducido por su propio orgullo lucifer arrastr a una gran parte de los ngeles que adoraban a dios provocando una rebeli n cuyas consecuencias fueron la existencia del dolor la maldad y la muerte en el mundo
8809566 dibuj sobre una mesita de madera con un objeto punzante la cabeza de una extra o rostro y a su lado escribi su apodo con letras may sculas de molde
8809567 la mujer daba muestras inequ vocas de estar pose da por un esp ritu maligno ten a la voz ronca y extra a giraba la cabeza hacia atr s sacaba la lengua de dimensiones aterradoras
8809568 este fervor tiene que ver con algo especial y particular que es irremplazable el ejemplo en la figura de juan curuchet
8809569 este es el triunfo de personas que se han dedicado perseverantemente durante a os a luchar y continuar no es triunfo de una elite de pocos o de un grupo es el gran triunfo de todos los marplatenses
8809570 no tengo memoria en que el triunfo haya cortado transversalmente la ciudad lleg a todos lados porque el esfuerzo se siente y es extraordinario y maravilloso lo bien que le hace a todos
8809571 este es un mensaje para todos los j venes porque este hombre me hizo una persona cabal con principios y con un cuerpo y alma sano
8809572 di was intended to supplement the adopted content standards and performance indicators it has over the past five years overtaken that
8809573 di is a reform program it is to supplement not to be the main curricular program
8809574 if parents are not able to pick up their kids then how are we going to ensure that the students are still able to take advantage of the program
8809575 so that means making arrangements for transportation are we going to be able to do that lets say they dont have a ride we will need to address that
8809576 thats why we needed to make sure we had this quarter to work it out
8809577 before she even started it was so hard for my kids to read
8809578 im really shocked by my kids now by their reading and their math di really does work
8809579 id rather have them do that in school hours they will get more out of it yeah pe is a good thing i would love to put my kids into other subjects but i dont think they need to stay after school
8809580 the basic principle there is the more time you spend teaching students the greater the possibility for them to succeed
8809581 we dont even know the number of students who qualify right now thats why we are monitoring
8809582 thats why we are not implementing this until the next quarter because we need to know what the numbers really are
8809583 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
8809584 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
8809585 on behalf of our students faculty staff and parents i want to thank first hawaiian bank for its contribution and support
8809586 our school has come so far in the last year this gift of furniture is much needed and appreciated
8809587 we cant just kick them out we will clean this mess up
8809588 if any tenants decide they dont want to exercise the opportunity to move on we will contact the office of the attorney general and exercise our next steps
8809589 we want them to come in so we can deal with them on a case to case family by family basis so we can sit down and discuss the issue
8809590 dpws first and foremost concern was the issue of safety relative to the structures now we will be able to go in and a proper assessment of the safety of them and be able to have a sit down with the families as to what the different options are
8809591 there really are no options other than to do what were trying to do
8809592 but were working to reassure them that no one is going to be made homeless that we are concerned about their safety and the welfare of their families
8809593 was very confident that there are no contracts out there that have not expired
8809594 we started looking into this situation when it was one familys story
8809595 in just the span of one week this eviction situation fell on the doorsteps of approximately 50 families in areas across the island each with a different story about their current living situation
8809596 these housing units and housing developments should have never fallen under the purview of the department of public works in the first place but we are where we are today and we can still find possible solutions to help these families avoid facing homelessness
8809597 pussy money and race cars thats pretty much all i care about
8809598 good guy he stays in resorts and stuff like that on race weekend wish i could afford that kind of lifestyle
8809599 tony will at times do or say things that make our skin crawl
8809600 we realized he was exactly the wrong breed to have as a pet
8809601 drivers never held back in the old days they said whatever came to mind you never knew what junior johnson was going to say but if he says it you know he believes it tonys like that i dont want our guys to be vanilla we need different flavors
8809602 running a cup team is a big step for me
8809603 but not too big i mean i worked my way up the ladder plus i already own a couple of race teams i got an edge
8809604 i tore around in my back yard with that and when i turned eight i was old enough to drive racing carts
8809605 i was racing again the next week young and dumb
8809606 my parents mortgaged their house so that i could go go cart racing
8809607 one day in february of 91 i ran second in a race in arizona and my portion of the prize money was 3 500
8809608 well i was making 5 an hour at the machine shop and i thought how many hours do i have to work to make what i make in one day driving a race car
8809609 we climbed a ladder one rung at a time nothing too soon
8809610 the greatest race car driver ive watched in this era
8809611 you know those kids in high school that talk all the time and wont shut up
8809612 and every once in a while someone gives them a good wailing thats kurt
8809613 we knew if we were at the same racetrack wed have to beat each other to win and we just got in a shoving match in race cars every time one of us would hit the other it was harder than the one before eventually kenny crashed me bad enough to where i couldnt get it to move
8809614 i reached in his car and tried to grab hold of him
8809615 wasnt a very smart thing to do the funny thing is dale earnhardt was in front of kennys car and earnhardt slows down to a crawl to give me time to get to kenny so the old man was working with me there
8809616 sometimes i just want to shake some damn sense into him
8809617 but tonys a good guy i would say that if he got in shape hed win even more races but i dont think tony needs to do that to win
8809618 i like to think i do things the right way
8809619 its about respect you get into a wreck with somebody you might hold a grudge for three or four weeks but it goes away theres a lot of water under the bridge
8809620 well be taking pictures and hanging out and all sorts of stuff
8809621 a little heartland a little misbehaving and a little book of revelations
8809622 what in the hell does this guy have his brights on for
8809623 is there a reason you have your high beams on
8809624 if quit you think i would have had the 28 year career i had sheeee it ive had enough of you tonight
8809625 if theres one thing i dont lack its pussy between me and tom here theres two things we definitely dont lack and thats pussy and money
8809626 pussy money and race cars thats pretty much all i care about
8809627 shit you cant blame junior even if its his fault
8809628 and i think that denny hamlin set the goddang record for unnecessary lane changes
8809629 well hes on his own at richmond and i mean it
8809630 haha who cares what you did 60 years ago you suck now
8809631 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8809632 what is it about evolution theory that albertans dont get
8809633 mccain calls obama naive about perils that afflict the world

8809638 arruinada pol tica y la fracasada presidencia de george w bush
8809639 john mccain vot con bush el 90 de las veces
8809640 mccain habla de juicio pero realmente qu cosa dice de tu juicio el hecho de pensar que george bush ten a raz n m s del 90 de las veces no s mucho sobre usted pero no estoy dispuesto a apostar por un 10 de chances de cambio
8809641 nos encontramos en uno de esos momentos definitorios un momento en que nuestra naci n est en guerra nuestra econom a est en serios problemas y el sue o americano est otra vez amenazado
8809642 esta noche m s estadounidenses est n desempleados y m s trabajan m s duro por menos muchos de ustedes perdieron sus casas
8809643 resultado directo de la arruinada pol tica de washington y la fracasada presidencia de george w bush
8809644 el 4 de noviembre debemos pararnos y decir ocho es demasiado dijo en alusi n a los a os que bush fue presidente
8809645 please think about this family today and say i love you to those you do life is fragile
8809646 at this stage they have made the business decision to begin the first phase of a master plan which includes conceptuals of various hospital developments
8809647 they will soon be forming a guam limited liability company and then begin the process of meeting property owners for puposes of entering into options to purchase or lease
8809648 i never thought id live this long to see this
8809649 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8809650 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8809651 one of the greatest things that ever happened in my 86 years
8809652 i know medgar martin luther king and others never dreamed they would see this day forty five years ago we couldnt do this medgar was killed 45 years ago trying to get the right to be heard period
8809653 the sportsmanship of hillary clinton really made women even greater
8809654 when barack became her candidate he became mine it was difficult because it was a bitter battle between two qualified very talented candidates for presidency
8809655 the state being involved in this case makes a lot of sense
8809656 too cool to do drugs parent youth conference make the choice use your voice be drug free for a healthy you and me
8809657 military help for georgia is a declaration of war says moscow in extraordinary warning to the west
8809658 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8809659 my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee i sing land where my fathers died land of the pilgrims pride from every mountainside let freedom ring
8809660 when it comes to some of these massage parlor types of fronts for prostitution activity they tend to come and go relatively quickly
8809661 we see them establish a store front open up for business more reorganize
8809662 the 1 year old little boy appeared to be in very good condition
8809663 he appeared to be healthy he appeared to be well nourished
8809664 this child appears to be about a year old appears to be well over 90 days old already has a few teeth
8809665 whats important is dropping out of the top 10 or the top 20
8809666 to be 21 or 24 probably doesnt make a whole lot of difference
8809667 marketing is much more sophisticated for most companies than basing ad buys on market rank
8809668 advertisers are more likely to look at current sales in a market what opportunities for growth there are and those wont be based on whether portland has 10 000 more homes than pittsburgh
8809669 if youre staying in the top 25 it shouldnt affect you
8809670 some argue if you stay in the top 30 theres really no change
8809671 i remember when san francisco dropped out of the top 5 and went to 6 they lost a lot of movie business
8809672 but when youre down at our level were considered a tier c movie market so well still be in that tier
8809673 its tough to see a city that you love in population decline
8809674 its not that weve had hundreds of thousands of people leaving our loss was fairly insignificant its just that other markets are growing and it is harder to recruit new employees to a no 23 market than it is to a no 19 market
8809675 the old guy that gave her some culture along the way
8809676 on aug 31 1803 capt meriwether lewis launched a 50 foot keeled boat from fort fayette 100 yards downriver this marked the beginning of the three year expedition commissioned by president jefferson which opened america to westward expansion
8809677 i think this is a wonderful thing for pittsburgh to be recognized officially as the launch of the exhibition
8809678 people in pittsburgh are understanding that now and before very few people thought about it the name of pittsburgh as the original gateway to the west it really is true
8809679 it just seemed very compelling to me that this was a military expedition authorized at the highest level and was secret
8809680 knowing that fort fayette had a u s wharf and they were and had been building boats there
8809681 all of the supplies for the expedition wouldnt have gone to a public place i just think it made all the sense in the world
8809682 bill has been on the cutting edge of so many things
8809683 on life with bonnie i had that family life and i had the talk show life and my writing partner don lake and i gravitated more and more to the talk show aspect of the show because its where we felt more comfortable because of our improvisational backgrounds
8809684 i was given the great gift of an incredibly healthy perspective of having spent time with people in the most intimate and vulnerable time of their lives
8809685 i was truly blessed with having done that first in my life before getting into show business
8809686 i have a great affinity for senior citizens i worked at a nursing home though high school theres a lost appreciation for a generation that has so much to tell us when were so full of self help books and doctors on tv
8809687 and as long as my mom is still around i still do stuff that pleases my mother
8809688 shes very self deprecating and i think that makes her so accessible
8809689 i didnt get into this business to do the same thing over and over
8809690 its an attempt to put my destiny in my own hands
8809691 being a producer allows me to develop material that says something to me to make movies i can be proud of
8809692 if we characterized one side as all good or all bad you could write off the film as just another piece of action pabulum
8809693 i see it as a movie about truth we wanted to tell an entertaining story but also to bring out other issues issues that usually get ignored
8809694 one of the things that being an actor affords me is to travel around the world on somebody elses dime youre getting paid to study other people other disciplines other religions what ive found is that most human beings no matter what they believe want the same things safety for their kids protection a roof food
8809695 hes this very religious man who is never unsure of his relationship to god but that faith comes in conflict with what he sees as his duty i see him as a good guy but a good guy who has killed innocent people by his actions he really feels the burden of that hes violating one of the main tenets of his faith
8809696 pretty much left us alone to make the movie we wanted
8809697 you know if you have the money you can make whatever movie you like but successfully steering your film through the process of marketing and interfacing with the moviegoing audience thats tricky
8809698 i thought talk to me was a really good movie and maybe 11 people saw it i didnt want that to happen here
8809699 i guess the answer is that i want to be excited i want not to be able to anticipate what will happen next i dont want on page 10 to know what will happen on page 60 if i can figure it out so will the audience i want something that keeps me guessing
8809700 like i said i dont want to do the same thing over and over again but if you dont it runs counter to your getting lots of work the studios are looking for a brand because it makes the product easier to sell the actor becomes a brand
8809701 but thats not exciting to me which means that my job is always going to be a bit of a grind that im going to have to hustle a bit more
8809702 but at the end of the day i can say yeah im proud of this movie
8809703 seriously the democrats nominated black man wow i thought they couldnt get much lower class than harry truman oh well you live you learn ive got to run now im supposed to be oppressing someone somewhere see you later
8809704 he reminds me of a butler we had shot once
8809705 go away my hat and i hate you we want to be left alone so that we can consummate our unholy love
8809706 as long as the working classes are happy and not paying attention to how were raping them then were fine with the negro fellow
8809707 im in love with him i mean it im leaving behind my pampered life of luxury to go into the future so that i can canvass for him if you see my husband tell him ive gone to luxembourg to buy a pack of lucky strikes
8809708 when did blacks get the right to vote can women vote now too
8809709 this is the second time and it is a record for the history of the festival we have five american films in competition
8809710 his sense of humor is bizarre but brilliant our kids loved him
8809711 eleven years ago when the etc was just a vision that randy and i were trying to make a reality ed generously shared with us his thoughts about how to prepare students for the new world of interactive digital media his suggestions including the idea of having everyone in the program study improvisational acting were priceless
8809712 i think they just shoot him from two different angles wearing a
8809713 they came to me and said are you interested in doing this and thats how it happened
8809714 hes a lifelong steelers fan and is extremely knowledgeable about the team and the game itself
8809715 there have been several occasions when weather mostly summer thunderstorms was an issue and we used jeffs expertise in these situations
8809716 i had a conversation with coach tomlin when he got here and he said youre my weatherman
8809717 sports and hd programming continue to be priorities for verizon but i cant be more specific about future content additions like the nhl network
8809718 no specific information about the future availability of the nhl network has been communicated to verizon sales representatives so there is no timetable that they should be sharing with customers
8809719 verizon is continually working to make more sports hd multicultural and other diverse programming available to fios tv customers but cannot preannounce anything until agreements with content providers are finalized
8809720 the site also includes a printable pdf file of the channel lineup that is periodically updated the one for pittsburgh was last updated 8 6 2008 and includes all the latest channels that were recently added this printable file has been available on that site for more than four weeks
8809721 technical problems prevented fsns hd broadcast of the pirates game in question on channel 226 in the ross area we are working to correct those beginning today we will again air all available fsn pittsburgh hd programming on mojo channel 226 in traditional areas channel 774 in former adelphia areas and will launch big ten network hd programming on channel 250 in traditional areas and channel 769 in former adelphia areas the big ten network agreement was signed after our announced addition of channels 250 769 as the locations for fsn pittsburgh hd programming
8809722 i just want to ask you why of all the stations that you have at the time of the presidential coverage the convention coverage that fox news wasnt included are you afraid that more people will watch fox news you know there is such a thing as fairness even in politics and certainly the candidate for the republican party has been getting the shaft obama is a weirdo thank you
8809723 now i say to you today my friends even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow i still have a dream
8809724 we are united with the democrats beh ind the obama biden presidential campaign to change america
8809725 its high time to return our government to hard working families
8809726 an historic ad i think this is the first of its kind
8809727 sen mccain is going to have an ad thats going to air in battleground states around the time that sen obama is speaking tonight
8809728 hes going to be talking directly to his opponent so im going to leave it there but its going be very exciting i think that a lot of people are going to focus on it
8809729 my understanding is that some if not all of the original charges are going to be withdrawn and they will place some new charges in the file
8809730 they didnt share their reasoning with us but it seems to me that the logical reason would be that there was not enough evidence for these charges to exist as a felony and that certainly a felony couldnt be proven in this case which is what weve been saying all along
8809731 inserting a foreign object into the rectum of a male while he was being held down on the floor of the school bus
8809732 one of the elements of aggravated sex abuse is penetration
8809733 we had volumes of information that there was no penetration so thats one element thats gone
8809734 would make it a little more factually unbelievable that the penetration did occur
8809735 i think the case got blown out of proportion long before it ever got to the district attorneys office to be thoroughly investigated
8809736 what the source was for that inflation of the truth i cant tell you for sure
8809737 there was some conduct that was certainly not appropriate but you know boys will be boys and i hate to say that because of the level that this was charged but at the same time the facts are the facts
8809738 its not something that these boys should be labeled criminals for
8809739 everything weve seen so far points away from the felony charge its a real shame to charge that level of crime before theres even a scintilla of evidence that can sustain the charge
8809740 you cant take away the fact that theyve been charged with aggravated sexual abuse in the third degree
8809741 that charge is going to show up on profiles throughout the rest of their lives so its very unfortunate they have 50 years forward that theyre gonna have to explain that
8809742 its a nice school system its a nice place to live
8809743 i think not just for these three young men that are charged but for the whole community some closure to this case and to go back to living their lives would be beneficial for everybody
8809744 i assume he qualified to run for the seat and he was elected
8809745 anybody in this country can join a party and run for a position on that party he is entitled to be seated if he acts according to our constitution
8809746 hopefully he left that past behind he shouldnt forget that this party was formed by abolitionists
8809747 we checked the young man out and his victory may not be valid
8809748 we required that candidates sign an oath of loyalty in june and he didnt do it as far as were concerned eduardo won
8809749 my understanding is that the oath had to be signed by the first meeting of the new committeemen and thats by december 1st theyre obviously looking for a way to keep me out but i wont let that happen
8809750 derek is still living at his familys home in palm beach from where his father runs the stormfront website and appears to be teaching derek the business
8809751 his mom chloe took him around introducing him to everyone
8809752 i ran because i want to make an impact at the local level dont judge me by my family judge me by what i want to achieve i want to sway my party to do something about the immigration invasion and the tax burden everyone in this country has the right to protect his groups interests white people will soon be a minority
8809753 if he wont judge me for my character instead of my race ill ask to please not support me in any way
8809754 shes got an infection and basically shes on an antibiotic drip

8809757 a greek parthenon set yahya come the fuck on man
8809758 he gave a good speech the one he needed to make but hes inexperienced his politics are non existent and ugh did you see his set oh my god it was too historical for my tastes i would have preferred a simple wooden dais with matching revolving sconces and a laced pastel floral arrangement
8809759 would it have been better if his speech was given in a bar b q joint

8809761 i couldnt make it out at first it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness
8809762 there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman
8809763 we are aware of the reports and we are looking at what can be done to identify the remains and establish whether they are of an australian and if they date back to the second world war
8809764 its too early to speculate on the nationality of the airman or the circumstances of his death there were allied australian and american and japanese airmen who would have been flying over the area in the war
8809765 a number of allied aircraft had been reported as missing in the area in particular b25 mitchells and a number of kitty hawk aircraft
8809766 defence is still determining arrangements to mount an expedition to the site
8809767 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8809768 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers

8809783 anderson had a hit and two walks and obviously should be a major building block based upon this evidence
8809784 now i had a look at the radio times for that period i chose november 1962 because that was the month when we celebrated 40 years of the bbc the first broadcast was in november 1922 and mr damazer will be thrilled to know that congratulations were received from louis armstrong nat king cole ray charles and wait for it the king himself elvis presley and they had sci fi plays one by someone you may have heard of john wyndham and there was the serialisation of that great futurist epic aniara by the swedish writer harry martinson for comedy there was the men from the ministry with wilfred hyde white and richard murdoch written and produced by edward taylor comedy playhouse peter sellers richard burton ian carmichael beryl reid

8809788 america we are a better than these last eight years
8809789 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8809790 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8809791 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8809792 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8809793 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8809794 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq you dont protect israel and deter iran by talking tough in washington
8809795 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but its not the change we need
8809796 people of every creed and colour from every walk of life
8809797 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8809798 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8809799 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8809800 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8809801 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8809802 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8809803 im not yet johnny depp or gerard depardieu im able to have my private moments and when people recognise me thats okay when i no longer have the desire to be recognised ill see then but its an attitude theres a way of being discreet
8809804 you dont have to pull the trigger to be a conspirator
8809805 theres not a shred of evidence that either cunningham or quigley wanted these men to die desired these men to die not a shred
8809806 dont allow an icc arrest warrant to be issued or we will undermine security for the un in darfur

8809821 man you used to be funny what happened to you
8809822 there are female golf players from 26 nations other than the united states competing on the lpga this year including 45 from korea the largest non american bloc players from mexico taiwan and korea have won the last five major championships and as the game continues to grow in nontraditional golf countries asia and latin america in particular the number of world class players for whom english is not the primary language will only increase the tightrope being walked here is between a practical and sensible business decision and the appearance of cultural chauvinism
8809823 this is all a bow to the great god marketing
8809824 imagine the reaction if european track promoters were arrogant enough to demand that americans speak german or dutch or french or if the japanese pga tour forbade its us born players from speaking english
8809825 its not that they cant speak english most of them can at least fake it they just dont want to be ridiculed because they cant speak smoothly in the american vernacular they also fear saying something impolitic or inaccurate as we all can hey even joe biden sprains his tongue
8809826 its not unreasonable to expect players to learn enough english to be functional with fans sponsors playing partners and the media while earning a livelihood in this country
8809827 some have argued the penalty is too severe and wondered how it will be determined whats acceptable and unacceptable i can understand the problem with the penalty but its hard to imagine that any of the lpgas 121 international players from 26 countries will be asked to recite websters dictionary or impersonate abraham lincoln in his gettysburg address
8809828 i think that it will be minnesota governor tim pawlenty mitt romney is a strong option but romneys primary campaign would supply obama with too much material for attack ads
8809829 it has been widely whispered around the mccain camp that if he were free to pick the candidate he felt would best complement his campaign and the man best prepared to be president mccain would pick either joe lieberman or tom ridge
8809830 both these names would make good sense for mccain in a time of broad alienation from the bush administration but both men are pro choice like the majority of the american people and that disqualifies them in the eyes of the gop gatekeepers its the last taboo
8809831 the long shot selection of independent democrat senator joe lieberman would be a game changer it would reinforce that mccain has centrist substance to compare with obamas centrist style and it would get him out of the democrats chief campaign attack to date that a vote for mccain is effectively a bush third term you cant make that case with gores vp by his side
8809832 the driver told me that the man came out of nowhere he just walked out into the street
8809833 his head smashed through her windshield and clashed against her head
8809834 i told him hold on you are going to be all right
8809835 he was a nice guy who would pump gas or panhandle for spare change this is a real shame
8809836 homeland security has admitted they dont have enough resources to be out there on the streets all the time
8809837 my goal is for hopefully one person on every block to be trained to watch his own house and family his own block
8809838 most of us are happy to call police its little boys who have never grown up
8809839 thats where i think these kinds of security issues should be addressed
8809840 the nypd does not encourage or cooperate with paramilitary groups
8809841 certainly not ones who arm or intend to arm its members
8809842 shit gotta do this dammit gotta do that like right now

8809844 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
8809845 citizens develop perceptions and when they develop those perceptions they draw conclusions without having all the facts
8809846 when people ask me where i work i just tell them im unemployed i live in janesville
8809847 i think the american people will vote obama in because he is not yet the man that he is going to become and mccain is no longer the man that he once was
8809848 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon him
8809849 the biggest problem confronting the world today is the illusion that our differences matter more than our common humanity
8809850 other than telling us how to live think marry pray vote invest educate our children and now die i think the republicans have done a fine job of getting government out of our personal lives

8809852 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8809853 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8809854 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8809855 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8809856 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of senator obama
8809857 the fact remains obama is still not ready to be president
8809858 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8809859 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8809860 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8809861 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but it is not the change america needs

8809886 the tendency to link refugee and irregular migration flows with security as in the case of the tampa should be placed under academic scrutiny
8809887 what we seek to do through our research is understand contemporary population flows in the historical context of migration patterns in east asia over the last 300 years highlighting that historical continuities are at play
8809888 while the movement of people within the asian region is not a new phenomenon the connection of forms of migration to security is an issue that is a novel challenge to governments in the 21st century
8809889 my most recent analysis reveals a striking trend a generation of conservative young priests is on the rise in the u s church
8809890 its a signal that the people are ready for change and that they believe only anwar can make that change
8809891 were not going to let our food costs rise faster than our food budgets so if we can buy in bulk we can save in a per eating effect
8809892 overall these trends last a long period of time because consumers adjust their buying habits and they change their routine
8809893 i wanted to be able to buy in bulk when things were on sale or at a pretty good price and have the room to save and freeze and store anything that we can get a good price
8809894 we are tackling it in response to clubs who want us to do something about it
8809895 we had one instance of a referee being assaulted at a mini festival by an irate parent who was upset because the referee had given a forward pass against the parents son
8809896 if we dont do something about it children will see it as acceptable behaviour
8809897 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8809898 i dont realise yet that i beat the no 1 in the world i dont realise that i played at the big court i dont know how im going sleep tonight
8809899 i was nervous going onto the court because i never saw coin play before so i didnt know what to expect
8809900 i thought i can slowly get into the match and she played completely different than i expected
8809901 she was serving extremely well and hitting very powerful shots
8809902 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8809903 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8809904 it could have the potential to hurt the company long term
8809905 some investors would be likely to think that no ceo could come in and match the performance that jobs has done
8809906 an incomplete story referencing apple inc was inadvertently published by bloomberg news at 4 27 p m new york time today the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted
8809907 i hope that the justice department will raise some strenuous objections to this deal but the zero hour is upon us
8809908 they deliver everything from soup to nuts and they rattle and bang ive got to go out there in my pajamas and knock on the truck
8809909 ive called amazon at least 10 times and i cant get to first base
8809910 my neighbor doesnt care if im stressed or not its caused terrific strife between my neighbor and myself
8809911 we try to be extremely sensitive to our customers and their neighbors
8809912 we get a lot of great customer feedback people are surprised weve been there at all
8809913 i actually have tried to contact amazon and theyre not returning my e mails
8809914 amazon seems to really isolate themselves from talking to people they dont want to
8809915 the situation with this is obviously some people are going to be bothered by it and some are not
8809916 if this keeps coming up all over the island eventually it could just be that they need to not provide that service that early in the morning i dont think people appreciate being woken up at 3 or 4 in the morning
8809917 new delivery ventures like amazonfresh are going to have to figure out what the legal parameters are and when they can operate in different jurisdictions
8809918 if we were to take specific legal action against amazonfresh we would have to have a pattern of complaints
8809919 were trying to be as respectful as we can of our customers and our neighbors
8809920 well this sounds like a cop out but that depends on what youre doing with it
8809921 its not good but i think at this point management is being somewhat conservative on the guidance
8809922 why are you so nervous when you see cops police are our friends
8809923 we have gathered here this week to dedicate ourselves to that new day
8809924 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years of bush is enough
8809925 now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal days work because i want my daughters to have the same opportunities as your sons
8809926 patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the troops have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8809927 surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit their loved ones in a hospital and live their lives free of discrimination
8809928 i was shocked i was just really really shocked and i was just panicking
8809929 the other girl got shot thats where the screaming came from everybody thought she was screaming because she was scared but she was hit
8809930 this has no rhyme or reason as far as motive is concerned we actually are puzzled as to why this sort of thing would happen
8809931 now i can see it could happen right around the corner from here
