6220000 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6220001 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6220002 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6220003 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6220004 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6220005 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6220006 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6220007 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6220008 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6220009 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6220010 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6220011 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6220012 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6220013 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6220014 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6220015 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6220016 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6220017 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6220018 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6220019 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6220020 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
6220021 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
6220022 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
6220023 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
6220024 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6220025 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6220026 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6220027 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6220028 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6220029 id wake up in the middle of the night wet with sweat
6220030 it got so bad i wasnt sleeping three hours straight the more sleep i lost the salsa plus avocado equals lower cancer risk and other healthy pairs
6220031 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6220032 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6220033 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6220034 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
6220035 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6220036 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6220037 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6220038 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6220039 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6220040 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6220041 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6220042 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6220043 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6220044 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6220045 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6220046 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6220047 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6220048 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6220049 this is also what my husband and son enjoy weve always liked having the competition in greenfield so since that was let go we thought wed just bring it back
6220050 weve invited people from across canada quebec ontario the maritimes and new england weve invited our friends from the west as well but we dont know if theyre going to make it theres a competition out there that conflicts with this one
6220051 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6220052 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6220053 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6220054 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6220055 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6220056 obamas race should not be a factor in this campaign we should vote on the issues and the issues alone
6220057 when i was growing up my parents taught me to not see color it doesnt matter that obamas black hes a person just like anybody else
6220058 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6220059 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6220060 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6220061 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6220062 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6220063 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6220064 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6220065 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6220066 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6220067 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6220068 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6220069 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6220070 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6220071 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6220072 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
6220073 das wrack war total verkohlt und voller leichen da sah nichts mehr wie ein flugzeug aus
6220074 all the girls in the office were on holiday when this went out so there was no one around to check it
6220075 when we asked the men what they thought they were doing it soon became clear they believed a period was either the five hours between breakfast and lunch or some kind of sporting contest
6220076 we then described a period in terrifyingly explicit biological terms and they all agreed that happy was not an appropriate word to use no matter how good your fanny pads are
6220077 i suggested have a period that doesnt make you want to stuff his nuts into the waste disposal but then again im having my period
6220078 were also going to lose the animation of the woman dancing around without a care in the world because thats just a lot of bollocks
6220079 preeclampsia may cause later renal disease the observation in other studies that 20 to 40 of the women with preeclampsia have microalbuminuria three to five years after pregnancy as compared with only 2 of women without preeclampsia may be interpreted as supporting a causal association
6220080 also possible that the women with preeclampsia and subsequent microalbuminuria had unrecognized renal disease before pregnancy
6220081 whatever the association the findings of vikse et al suggest the potential for early identification of women at increased risk for chronic kidney disease
6220082 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
6220083 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
6220084 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
6220085 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen

6220095 before the events in georgia and because of the u s calendar
6220096 today after what has happened in the caucasus it can be clearly seen that real security guarantees that would not leave poland just with the installation are essential it seems such arguments are taken more seriously now by the u s
6220097 what is crucial and what decided the success of the talks over the last couple of days was that the u s offered us new proposals
6220098 was signed at a time of a very difficult crisis in relations between russia and the u s over the situation in georgia
6220099 shows that of course the missile defense system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
6220100 poland by deploying the interceptors is exposing itself to a strike one hundred percent
6220101 is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
6220102 missile defense of course is aimed at no one it is in our defense that we do this
6220103 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
6220104 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
6220105 his resume as a coach and an athlete truly speaks for itself

6220109 when you go through a bad stretch like this its tough on fans the players the players wives
6220110 it affects a lot of people these guys are suffering and i tell them not to take it home with them your wife didnt hang that slider
6220111 you cant keep telling guys the same thing over and over its tough losing like this its tough on all of us
6220112 we need those dollars to be able to find that 1 1 billion to make these bridges safe and to make this rail line run
6220113 weve ruled out any illnesses that would cause him to miss any playing time
6220114 weve got a little bit more work to do but were optimistic that hes going to be able to make the opener thats great news for him and great news for our team

6220132 this year a record 5 856 pelicans were counted on southeast farallon island in mid july researchers said
6220133 they said these measurements just arent right hes too long
6220134 and at four months he had all of his teeth
6220135 he was the size of a typical 8 year old boy
6220136 i have to say that the hematologists and oncologists here actually helped us figure it out
6220137 he has a very unusual rearrangement of his genetic material its whats called an inversion of chromosome 12 and it affects every single cell in his body
6220138 this gene is functioning despite the regulation that it shouldnt be

6220145 since 2004 turner has requested millions in earmarks for a local organization that later hired his wife and a highway project that would benefit one of her business partners
6220146 for forty years this district was represented by honest politicians congressman chuck whalen a republican and congressman tony hall a democrat
6220147 congressman turner has only been there for five and a half years why cant we expect the same conduct in office from him
6220148 potentially be a violation of the ethics in government act
6220149 has failed to disclose peebles homes of beavercreek llc to the clerk of the house of representatives
6220150 recent information given to the dayton daily news indicates that peebles homes of beavercreek is a subsidiary of turner effect meaning he is not legally required to disclose the existence of the company in question the dayton daily news article focuses on the previously undisclosed corporation however it does not address questions raised about millions of dollars of earmarks and contracts benefiting congressman turners wife and his political campaign contributors the company peebles homes of beavercreek was incorporated on the day turner was first elected to the united states congress in 2002 to build high dollar custom homes on land owned by defense contractor raj soin another major turner financial supporter
6220151 if finding a way to bury the facts is what passes for ethics no wonder the gop is in so much trouble
6220152 certification that both the member and the members spouse have no financial interest in the earmark
6220153 an earmark benefits development projects of clients or subsidiaries of turner effect although indirect congressman mike turner and his spouse have a financial interest in the project
6220154 while the letter of the law may not have been violated
6220155 the spirit of the law to keep government transparent and working for the people has clearly been side stepped
6220156 as of summer 2007 savings were a negative 1 3 percent an all time low

6220160 these debates are great opportunities to share our visions for this district and the country with voters

6220194 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6220195 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6220196 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance
6220197 securing our border needs to be a priority for this administration people keep finding reasons not to secure our border and the longer we delay the greater the risk is to our country our border states are under siege from drug trafficking human smuggling and other illegal activities i would hope that the department of homeland security dhs and the interior department can come to an agreement that will enable completion of the virtual border fence to be done as soon as possible

6220258 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

6220268 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6220269 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this
6220270 until the fannie and freddie issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere

6220273 a very important question was if i could make it convincing i considered the storyline as a challenge and a big chance to learn and grow as an actor
6220274 of course its brilliant that our story now becomes known all over the world its not the case though that i cannot go outside without being attacked from some paparazzi in cologne people are used to meeting actors from tv so in this respect i can live here comparatively undisturbed

6220291 if all that reporters describe are disasters assassinations riots and reverses
6220292 we are left with an image of the world as fragile or accident prone and the best intended news story becomes the source of stereotype and untruth
6220293 news distorts precisely because it is news because it is the nature of news to be discontinuous
6220294 poor information is a cause of stereotyping and blatant stereotypes create xenophobia which is the opposite of curiosity
6220295 americans are surprised at how few of the 95 percent of humanity with whom they share a planet actually do hate them
6220296 even now after war in iraq has gone so horribly wrong many people still look across the ocean for hopeful signs of change
6220297 now i would confront my uneasiness about a people whose image of muslims was that of elusive terrorists whose pictures were splashed again and again across tv screens and newspapers
6220298 nothing is homogeneous in this country not even the language

6220317 this compromise budget proposal puts our state on the road to fiscal sanity and will give california a budget that works
6220318 substituting one tax increase for another is not a bipartisan compromise nor will it solve our long term budget problems
6220319 increasing taxes on hard working californians whether temporary or permanent is not only unnecessary it is irresponsible
6220320 i have made it very clear that we cannot tax our way out of this problem i do not believe in tax increases
6220321 i think it is key for us that we finish this year with victories and not another year where nothing gets done just because everyone is stuck in their ideology
6220322 i keep hammering away at them every time i talk to them let us get together let us work this out dont come to the table with the same stubborn position
6220323 the republicans came in with the mantra no taxes no taxes no taxes and then the democrats came in and said no cuts no cuts you cant continue this way

6220325 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
6220326 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6220327 oh my god i was so pissed off so mad i was just shaking
6220328 immediately i had to go into take care of business mode
6220329 i watched her have a mastectomy and then i watched her go through two years of chemotherapy and eight surgeries and a hysterectomy
6220330 ive watched this woman survive both of those things so for me there was always that sense that i was going to be okay no matter what
6220331 besides me being really vigilant about it mammograms and self examinations it is the no 1 reason i am going to live

6220334 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
6220335 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
6220336 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me

6220340 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan

6220343 theres definitely a broad consensus among our clients that there may need to be some concessions on saps piece but its also important to understand what value they may receive thats a fair discussion
6220344 some are definitely not enthused about a forced march and not thrilled about the level of service theyre already getting the flip side is some customers dont mind this hike because theyre going to get every penny out of it
6220345 as you get older the vaccine becomes less cost effective
6220346 we can see the youngest one the 11 year old at the gun store taking guns

6220349 who would have believed that we would reach such achievements they are reality now
6220350 because of the miniaturization of all kinds of spacecraft technology these nano and micro spacecraft are becoming more plausible and possible in many types of missions
6220351 its our dream and vision and hope that eventually we can place smaller spacecraft in all types of missions not just in near earth orbit
6220352 for those missions you can be at various distances from the sun and being able to change your thermal balance is a good thing
6220353 the test for micrometeoroids was very simple we just fired a gun loaded with small particles and tiny harpoon like needles at it
6220354 a lot of spacecraft engineers have come to us saying if we had this technology it would give us much greater design freedom for future micro spacecraft
6220355 i was concerned about my society after reading that first post
6220356 i am concerned non terrorists are targeted for the last time i was just reiterating my understanding that a redress process although not very effective apparently was in place nullifying the need for the specific actions being requested i wasnt being an apologist for any governement actions
6220357 i am not being intentionally ignorant however i am concerned about how our government regards its subjects and even more concerned about how little we the subjects seem to care as illustrated by your cold and unempathetic posts
6220358 id start being concerned about society when people stop asking questions
6220359 the courts should be allowed to sincerely explore how things can get so horribly out of hand

6220378 car cter sesgado y arbitrario del programa emitido por chilevisi n cuya propiedad pertenece al candidato de la derecha quien se ha manifestado favorable a la privatizaci n parcial de codelco chile una vez m s se comprueba la incestuosa relaci n entre los negocios y la pol tica
6220379 no es necesario ser muy agudo para presumir con fundamento que los ataques frontales contra codelco buscan generar una opini n p blica contraria a la continuidad de como una empresa 100 del estado tal como lo hemos reiterado en otras oportunidades la generaci n de una imagen de empresa estructuralmente corrupta ineficiente desordenada y fuera de control son un camino que conduce directamente a su privatizaci n
6220380 molesta el aprovechamiento pol tico que se busca hacer de codelco pasando por alto hechos objetivos e irrefutables la empresa es dirigida por jos pablo arellano quien es reconocido por todos los actores pol ticos del pa s como una persona con una trayectoria intachable y contraria a cualquier acto de corrupci n el mismo comit de auditoria lo encabeza un director independiente de y del gobierno nicol s majluf quien es un destacado acad mico y director de empresas por lo que da plena garant as respecto a las medidas de control interno y a la contrataci n con los m s altos est ndares exigidos a los auditores externos
6220381 los diputados que hicieron asesor as a codelco sean pasados a la comisi n de tica de la c mara
6220382 el diputado jorge insunza tuvo contratos con codelco y desde el punto de vista tico l no debi formar parte de la comisi n investigadora y menos haberla presidido eso no es aceptable
6220383 los diputados no podemos tener contratos con el estado por lo tanto ese diputado incurri en una falta ese caso debe pasar a la comisi n de tica y el diputado debe devolver los dineros que se le cancelaron

6220394 this kind of blatant disregard for pro lifers rights on the part of governor martin omalleys state police wont be tolerated if these pro lifers were pro abortion activists or peta protesters this would have been on the front page of every newspaper on the east coast

6220432 we also note that because consumers are entitled to access the lawful internet content of their choice providers consistent with federal policy may block transmissions of illegal content e g child pornography or transmissions that violate copyright law to the extent however that providers choose to utilize practices that are not application or content neutral the risk to the open nature of the internet is particularly acute and the danger of network management practices being used to further anticompetitive ends is strong
6220433 considers whether the network management practice is intended to distinguish between legal and illegal activity the commissions network principles only recognize and protect users access to legal content the sharing of illegal content such as child pornography or content that does not have the appropriate copyright is not protected by our principles similarly applications that are intended to harm the network are not protected

6220436 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6220437 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6220438 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6220439 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much

6220453 at this point in the season the team still tried to play good football the positive thing was that ball was moved quickly
6220454 serdar tasci did everything that was expected of him for a first international he really played well

6220459 were potentially headed to one of the worst droughts weve ever had in california because of the conditions of storage the fact that were expecting very erratic weather patterns and we have much more demand than the last drought in 1993
6220460 when water is available we must be prepared to move large volumes of water during a relatively short time and then store it for use during dry periods and emergencies
6220461 the shoes fit badly their bag is too big theyre not used to having 100 necklaces on their neck theres nothing wrong with being trendy if thats what youve been doing all your life
6220462 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6220463 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6220464 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance

6220475 everyone watching that video would feel shock and be sickened by what happened
6220476 the child must have been extraordinarily shocked to be woken up by the extreme pain sufficient to make it vomit what happened is caught on video a short clip of which has been shown to this court
6220477 it shows you going into that childs room leaning into the cot and then punching a sleeping child in the back five times
6220478 as a result of concerns about the child the parents had set up a video camera in the childs room
6220479 during the course of the evening the child was put to bed in its cot
6220480 he was followed by the childs father and he saw the defendant coming from the direction of the childs bedroom
6220481 the father went to the childs room and could see the child had vomited and was in a distressed state in the cot
6220482 when looking at the video later he saw the defendant come into the room and then strike the child five times while it was sleeping in its cot and then left the room quickly
6220483 my feelings towards stephen carty are pure hatred for what he has done
6220484 he has carried out the most awful thing to my son and i can never forgive him
6220485 he is very sorry for what he has done his remorse is palpable
6220486 during the course of the party several things were said to him such as he would be changing his daughters nappy when she was 10 or 11
6220487 were happy that theyve taken the effort to hide the names of products in our category

6220492 we shouldnt have sent these young men to go and get killed

6220496 new century new everything that means for me this is a new era in the arts and media i think many are beginning to see that but the media is one collective group that does not here is a list of the new art and media developments that the old media refuses to acknowledge or talk about come on you dinosaurs in electronic and print media end the boycott against whats new and creative and come out of last century new list 1 zines and blogs not novels 2 youtube films not hollywood films 3 post modern art not the gallery museum art system 4 post bands music not 50 year old rock 5 no ad online newspapers not ad driven media 6 no ad review sites not ad driven review sites 7 all purpose art centers not separate museums libraries concert halls 8 first world culture through the internet not separate regional cultures only songwriters a monday quiz for youthe answer to and winner if any for our last contest question of whats the vaudeville term for the cheapest seats in the theater is the peanut gallery also in the early days of tv the howdy doody show called its live audience the peanut gallery one of two possible winners we may have a tie here is heath from brooklyn ny the rest of you must have been in the lobby i dont dumb down so please wise up now on to a new q win a copy of my new cd called 30 first anti band cd or my newer cd called next
6220497 a lot of bands and artists feel that its hard to get any interest from record labels due to the state most labels are in they all seem to be playing it very safe
6220498 a lot of people think its impossible to have a successful music career without a label but theres a lot of talented bands and artists out there who just havent been lucky enough to get the breaks

6220505 just as with the citys dog licensing and leash laws the department is going to depend on voluntary compliance
6220506 we must have a very serious conversation in this city about putting another law on the books regarding animal and public safety that will go largely unenforced and hopefully not ignored
6220507 it comes at a time when the department sustained 15 percent budget cuts this year and were facing the layoffs of some 27 employees
6220508 with apple shapes where people tend to have large waists with skinny legs and hips the risk of high cholesterol and heart disease is higher what weve found is that the fat tissue that lines the abdomen the adipose fat is high in the inflammatory markers that lead to heart and cholesterol problems
6220509 as women age their cholesterol profile changes because as estrogen levels go down the hdl or good cholesterol also goes down and the ldl or the bad cholesterol goes up
6220510 in men the low testosterone levels that sometimes occur in 50s and 60s can increase the risk for heart disease pre diabetes and insulin resistance
6220511 during this time we also see an increase in abdominal fat so its actually the opposite of women where we see a decrease in estrogen causing an increase in adipose fat
6220512 stories of and from women in science engineering technology and math

6220525 per me un mistero il motivo per cui la polizia giapponese abbia scelto come obiettivo tre membri dellequipaggio relativamente poco importanti
6220526 come capitano tutti i membri dellequipaggio di sea shepherd si comportano in conformit ai miei ordini tutte le attivit che si oppongono alle azioni illegali della flotta baleniera giapponese sono sotto la mia responsabilit eppure nessuna accusa stata mossa contro di me questo assurdo e non ha alcun senso
6220527 i mandati di arresto contro questi tre uomini non avranno assolutamente alcun impatto sulla campagna
6220528 ritorneremo al santuario delle balene negli oceani del sud e ricominceremo la nostra campagna di intervento contro le attivit illegali della flotta baleniera giapponese non potremo essere fermati non ci ritireremo e non concederemo mai la vita delle balene indifese ai cacciatori fuorilegge del giappone
6220529 per ora sembra che sia un duello di mandati darresto
6220530 in dicembre questa ridicola retorica verr messa da parte quando affronteremo gli assassini di balene con nuove tattiche nuove strategie e con due navi contro la flotta baleniera pirata i cacciatori di balene sono ormai alla disperazione
6220531 la sea shepherd conservation society non sta semplicemente protestando contro la caccia alle balene ci stiamo opponendo alla caccia illegale secondo il principio della carta mondiale per la natura delle nazioni unite se la nostra attivit illegale allora il mandato dovrebbe essere emesso contro di me non contro tre volontari che non avevano il grado di ufficiale
6220532 noi siamo i poliziotti del mare e il nostro target sono i criminali che depredano gli oceani della vita in violazione delle leggi internaizonali se la polizia giapponese riuscir ad arrestare qualcuno di questi tre uomini useremo il tribunale per focalizzare lattenzione internazionale sulle continue attivit illegali di caccia alle balene del giappone
6220533 quel che vediamo una operazione criminale che riceve il sostegno del governo giapponese il quale prende di mira i difensori della natura che tentano di opporsi al massacro illegale delle balene tutto quello che posso dire ai cacciatori giapponesi ci rivediamo a dicembre faccia a faccia negli oceani del sud per uno scambio di vedute in alto mare noi ci saremo

6220558 god forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion the people cannot be all and always well informed the part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive if they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is lethargy the forerunner of death to the public liberty and what country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of resistance let them take arms the remedy is to set them right as to the facts pardon and pacify them what signify a few lives lost in a century or two the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants it is its natural manure

6220616 nascar gave them a bunch of considerations from a parameter point of view a dimension point of view that was outside the box in terms of what the ford engine was
6220617 so nascar in the interest of fairness and balance in the competition from a potential point of view after they went to great lengths to be able to check the engines to find out what they were doing decided that they needed to rein toyota in and thats what they did
6220618 the error wasnt ours for getting behind the error was in what toyota offered and what nascar approved
6220619 i think the frustration on the team side or the team side other than gibbs you know everyone across the board why we are so upset about this so angry about this is weve been told now for six straight months from the media from nascar from anyone that toyota is just better than us
6220620 were losing races because theyre just better than us denny hamlin is just better than i am kyle busch is just better than you are his crew chief is better than your team their shock guy is better than your team and then you go and you see something like this and you go wait a minute
6220621 then you see something like this and you go wait a minute what was i thinking i can run with these guys and ive been beat up now for 12 months or six months or whatever its been for no reason and thats very sad
6220622 first we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6220623 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6220624 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable
6220625 from a penalty status the biggest thing that sets out in my mind is what they did
6220626 its almost like what they did was just worse than even cheating in that one race i almost wish they would have cheated in that one race because i would have felt better about it but what they attempted to do was cheat us for the rest of the season all the way up to probably atlanta of next year before another dyno test was done so thats what makes it even worse
6220627 we had come to the conclusion that we would add to any nascar imposed penalties with the minimum being suspension for the remainder of the season for those involved including our two nationwide series crew chiefs
6220628 there will also be an additional monetary fine beyond the amount announced by nascar earlier today which will be the responsibility of those involved
6220629 in this world of sin and sorrow there is always something to be thankful for as for me i rejoice that i am not a republican

6220797 despite the strong performance and excellent positioning of our airports security price performance has been disappointing so far in 2008
6220798 whilst this is primarily a consequence of external factors beyond maps control action has nonetheless been taken to address this security price underperformance

6220836 senator mccain believes as i do that a compact thats been worked out between the governors and between the states is the right way to go states are the ones who build these kinds of understandings the federal government shouldnt meddle in that compact

6220882 he made a really good start right out of the block he made a really nice birdie to get one up early on
6220883 he only dropped one hole to the guy and that was just through a tricky little putt that danny missed aside from that he didnt really do anything horribly all day a couple of little hiccups but really he just got out put the guy four behind early on and made him work to try and get back and he just wasnt up to it
6220884 dannys just taking it at a round at a time at the moment but hes the best amateur in the world by quite a way at the moment so hes pretty confident he can roll over anyone out there

6220896 councillor robin newton the dup group leader said that on friday morning the strategic policy and resources committee will discuss the provision of hospitality for members of the armed forces following a homecoming parade to st annes cathedral
6220897 i hope that all committee members will be able to support the civic reception and that t hose who feel they are unable to vote for will at least not vote against the worst thing for the city will be if this issue becomes a political football with the resulting bad feeling that will be generated
6220898 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6220899 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6220900 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden
6220901 bombs threaten life and property as would more harmful devices not yet found in the possession of terrorists but that they might conceivably obtain
6220902 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
6220903 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6220904 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6220905 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
6220906 i was with a friend doing some sightseeing on the wettest day of the year and having set out for a stroll to get a better view of the rope bridge which was closed due to bad weather we came upon three men in a piece of exposed ground under a large cliff face so strange was the situation that im not sure if it was performance art or some patients on day release one man was sitting on a fold up stool he was bald quite old and wearing some manner of an upside down hat which contained a shoe mould as well as a childs shoe another large oldish character was wearing a high viz jacket and lying on the ground staring at a boules petanque ball he occasionally got up to throw it badly according to my friend the boules expert and follow after the ball before getting back down on the ground and resuming his staring meanwhile the third man who was younger than the rest produced a rusty bicycle wheel from a bag and began rolling it around the rough ground every so often he would squeeze an old fashioned low pitched car horn which sounded not unlike a duck quacker this was taking place at approximately 2 30pm on saturday afternoon my questions are there surrealists at large on the causeway coast and if so naturally is this art or is a local institution missing some of its in patients
6220907 an emergency meeting of the regional development committee was told independent consultants would examine what had happened
6220908 no doubt the culvert did its job it was designed and built exactly in accordance with specifications and put into practice
6220909 but unfortunately you cant countenance for severe weather conditions like this
6220910 it had been through the whole process of checking rivers agency were happy with it we were happy with it and the roads service were happy with the design we put forward or else nobody would have signed on it nobody anticipated the amount of rain we had and i dont think the finger pointing is going to help we just have to see how we are going to get over this problem and prevent it in the future
6220911 the decision to realign the clowney river to the south of the underpass rather than integrate it into the roof slab has been a major factor in allowing us to reprogramme the work to finish this part early this allowed us to deal more efficiently with numerous overhead and underground services and keep traffic running during the construction
6220912 the chinese boxer other finalist zou shiming beat barnes convincingly in the world championships in chicago last year
6220913 the notion that christianity in general and evangelicalism in particular are by nature right wing creeds has always been wrong how can a faith built around a commitment to the poor and the vulnerable be seen as leading ineluctably to conservative political conclusions
6220914 it was mccains night obama made no big mistakes but his tendency to somewhat windy generalities meant he wasnt particularly compelling mccain who went second was crisp by contrast and his anecdotes colorful
6220915 members of the orange order belong to the institution because they are firmly committed to their reformed protestant faith and in a world where secular values are changing the societies in which we live our faith is important to us
6220916 they might think they are being smart issuing that type of answer but it is showing that they are burying their heads in the sand many members have been very positive about the suggestion internally but nothing has happened at an official level yet
6220917 were a pro protestant organisation not an anti catholic one were an all ireland body and we have members in nine counties in the republic
6220918 the biennial pew research center report on changing news audiences describes 13 of the us public as
6220919 remarkably at a time when nearly all newspapers are losing sales and celebrity and mens magazines are reporting significant circulation losses the cerebral weeklies and monthlies continue to grow in the first half of this year the circulation of the oldie climbed 15 5 per cent to 28 862 compared with the same period last year the spectator rose 5 1 per cent to 76 952 the uk sale of the economist grew by 5 6 per cent year on year to 182 539 the week was up 4 5 per cent at 150 099 and prospects circulation rose 10 7 per cent to 27 552
6220920 to bang on too much about the internet as the distinguishing factor between newspapers and magazines seems to me rather dangerous
6220921 is it good value for money only 33 of those surveyed agreed that it was and some 47 disagreed with 28 disagreeing strongly does the licence fee ensure provision of programming not available elsewhere not according to a clear majority of those expressing a view 41 and perhaps most worrying of all is it an appropriate way of funding the bbc only just over half of those polled and expressing a view thought it was

6220933 a realistic tale of a mother and son screenwriting team in the 1940s a b movie about the uneasy alliance between a in which a painfully shy princess makes a dark pact with a mercurial old witch
6220934 the themes in the play are mothers having to release their children out into the world no matter how painful that may be
6220935 then the larger theme is how writers use everything in their lives for their creative work consciously and unconsciously past and present honoring sentimentalizing and cannibalizing their relationships

6220956 i expect barack obama to win washington state and i expect to be his partner as governor to bring the kind of results weve achieved in washington state all across america
6220957 we have so many obama supporters that are our supporters one of my bigger fundraisers is an obama supporter
6220958 were going to have tens of thousands of people who are voting for obama who will vote for us
6220959 i think that it shows that the hard work that weve been undertaking over the last four years is resonating in urban and rural communities in all four corners of the state
6220960 the reality is that less than half the people who are going to show up at the general voted in the primary the bottom line is this is going to be a sprint to the end
6220961 its a typical tactic of trying to create fear he has absolutely no basis none whatsoever he makes things up and continues to do so by making that statement

6220965 i really want to think about how this is going to work both in london and and possibly on broadway
6220966 experience is the best and simplest way to learn anything that is why it is so valued in the business world
6220967 it defines the corporations character and culture formal and informal networks all the elements that compose the dynamics of an organisation
6220968 in china for example etiquette and attitudes are very different so a successful strategy in europe might fail in china changemasters can reflect these cultural differences
6220969 some people have enormous influence in a corporation or department through their reputation or their informal networks of co workers
6220970 and we recommend that it is run as a seminar with a large number of staff forming teams to run through the change scenario but some companies like ikea run the game in small workshops
6220971 nobody wins nobody manages a painless project i think this is the way it should be it should be challenging and it should reflect real life it tests the limits of managers confidence the idea is for people to learn lessons and acquire new skills before carrying out a task in a realistic scenario
6220972 people wouldnt play the game or would complain about it loudly if they thought it was fixed
6220973 we initially produced an interface like the online game second life it had a 3d richly visual environment but executives spent too much time exploring the environment rather than playing through the games
6220974 i believe the iphone is closer to the mobile phone of the future compared with the latest japanese mobile phones
6220975 its essentially the story of the first white for white teenagers in the south starting in 1950 its very much about the and the heavy african american influence on rock and roll and its also about how white people co opted
6220976 he called me with this idea and i immediately thought this untold story was worth doing it was really dangerous for the deejays to do this in the deep south in the 50s
6220977 these guys loved this music and believed it could and should reach a big audience
6220978 hes a larger than life personality and he develops a big listenership so hes very able to bring this music to a large public the station owners dont understand it but when it gets on the radio people listen to it

6221044 i have plugged my laptop into a hospital ethernet line because the wireless was down
6221045 i have researched hotels that do not provide internet but are nearby wireless hubs to get connection freely
6221046 i went up to the top of a mountain and worked for a week from a tent
6221047 logged into hotel conference rooms to get the connection for free
6221048 paid for a cab ride while i worked on the internet
6221049 plugged into electricity from the city of seattle that was on a pole on the sidewalk but only for a few minutes

6221051 sat outside an airport for 4 hours so i could use the free wireless across the street

6221071 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

6221078 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6221079 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6221080 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6221081 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6221084 this driver was stopped between 8am and 9am this morning on the northern motorway after traveling at 90 km ph you can see his visibility is practically nil and it is not worth the risk to other road users

6221086 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6221087 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6221088 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6221089 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6221090 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6221091 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom

6221094 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

6221096 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

6221098 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6221099 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6221100 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6221101 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6221102 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6221103 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6221126 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6221127 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6221128 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6221129 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6221130 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6221131 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6221132 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6221133 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6221134 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6221135 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6221136 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6221137 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6221138 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6221139 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6221140 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6221141 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6221142 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6221143 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6221144 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6221145 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6221146 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6221147 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6221148 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6221149 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6221150 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6221151 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6221152 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6221153 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6221154 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6221155 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6221156 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6221157 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6221158 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6221159 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

6221180 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6221181 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6221182 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6221183 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

6221192 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6221193 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6221194 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6221195 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6221196 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6221197 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6221214 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6221215 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6221216 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6221217 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6221218 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6221219 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

6221227 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6221228 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6221229 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6221230 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

6221235 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6221236 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6221237 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

6221240 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6221241 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6221242 we expect that within a month more or less this will be resolved
6221243 the only way to lift the strike is through a mutual agreement the problem is and has always been that union demands are not related to labor issues
6221244 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6221245 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6221246 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6221247 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6221248 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6221253 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6221254 however as this case began over four years ago the best thing for our customers and the company is to put this dispute behind us once and for all

6221264 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6221265 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6221266 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6221267 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6221268 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6221269 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

6221272 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6221273 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

6221276 bearing in mind that 2007 was a record year for emigration the fact that even more people are looking to move abroad this year shows that there is now a very real desire to escape some of the problems of the uk economy
6221277 and then theres the father and son hunting in the woods who see the predator space ship crash which visually looks like twenty miles away in the next shot theyre picking their way through debris and banging on the hull bravo
6221278 oh my god weve got to arm ourselves and leave town lets round up a posse call in the national guard
6221279 signature investigative reporting enterprise trend stories news features and reviews
6221280 for our bloggers especially this may require a bit of an adjustment
6221281 some of you like to try out ideas that end up as subjects of stories or columns in print first if in doubt consult your editor
6221282 the company is optimistic that first production from dolores will take place at the end of the third quarter but notes this may be pushed back to early in the fourth quarter as a result of the most recent illegal blockade
6221283 theyre folks who dont typically need the social badge of a premium brand theyre confident in themselves and in their own skin
6221284 how much will the hyundai badge deter buyers who want a premium vehicle
6221285 if people think they lehman are heading toward bankruptcy nobody will want to do business with them or make them new loans thats fulds biggest problem
6221286 they are clearly not as keen on investing in the financial sector until the credit crisis plays out
6221287 selling off assets would be at fire sale prices and investors will bark if you try and sell some of the crown jewels of the company
6221288 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6221289 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6221290 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6221291 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6221292 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6221293 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6221294 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6221295 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6221296 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6221297 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6221298 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6221299 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6221300 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6221301 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6221302 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6221303 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6221304 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6221305 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6221306 this is a planning took where all things are going
6221307 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6221308 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6221309 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6221310 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6221311 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6221312 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6221313 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6221314 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6221315 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6221316 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6221317 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6221318 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6221319 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6221320 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6221321 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6221322 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6221323 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6221324 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6221325 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6221326 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6221327 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6221328 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6221329 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6221330 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6221331 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6221332 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6221333 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6221334 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6221335 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6221336 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6221337 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6221338 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6221339 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6221340 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6221341 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6221342 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6221343 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6221344 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6221345 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6221346 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6221347 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6221348 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6221349 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6221350 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6221351 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6221352 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6221353 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6221354 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6221355 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6221356 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6221357 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6221358 flavor a lot of these sequences dont really add much to the performance and some of them drag on to the point of frustration
6221359 there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy because
6221360 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6221361 we were pleased with our earnings performance for the second quarter
6221362 our same store sales continue to be impacted by the current economic environment however we believe our marketing and messaging helped us during the quarter as our comparable sales performance continued to outpace the chicken quick service restaurant segment
6221363 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6221364 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6221365 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6221366 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6221367 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6221368 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6221369 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6221370 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6221371 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6221372 its very compact easy to use and detachable to sixaxis and dual shock controllers
6221373 against all odds a tibetan has once again raised our outlawed national flag in beijing tonight
6221374 this action symbolises the determination and steadfast commitment of the tibetan people and our supporters from around the world to achieve freedom and justice for six million tibetans living under the brutal rule of the chinese government
6221375 the chinese government is petrified of these peaceful acts of defiance simply because they represent the true feelings of tibetans inside tibet
6221376 our protests are a reminder to the world of the tragic reality of the chinese governments illegitimate occupation of tibet and the urgent need for the chinese leadership to seek a resolution with the tibetan people
6221377 we realized there was such interest and excitement in these categories to do with height that it was too important a category for us to leave it to a doctor alone
6221378 so we decided to tighten things up completely to make sure there was no doubt
6221379 he has gone on record saying he doesnt want to be bothered basically he doesnt want the fame and publicity that comes with being the worlds tallest man
6221380 whether or not thats the real reason im not sure but thats what hes told us
6221381 need glory i just want a normal life under normal conditions
6221382 he was a bit of a recluse he looked after goats then the fame that he got from being a guinness world record holder meant that he found himself a wife his life improved
6221383 because of the cost of making the playstation 3 and because they sold it at a loss sony basically has pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3 because its lost more money than they made during the entire peak of the playstation 2 its not going to happen again for sony
6221384 if they release the playstation 4 and have an even more expensive console and raise the cost of games by ten dollars that would not be good
6221385 so this is going to force them to make the ps3 last longer and theyre kind of positioning to do that
6221386 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6221387 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6221388 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6221389 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6221390 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6221391 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6221392 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6221393 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6221394 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6221395 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6221396 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6221397 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6221398 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6221399 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6221400 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6221401 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6221402 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6221403 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6221404 the shows editors got to exact their cutting room tactics early on in the show when timberlakes monologue took an uncomfortably racial turn
6221405 when i withdraw were done with obama we might have to return
6221406 we will come home we will come home with victory and honor but we will never have to go back
6221407 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6221408 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6221409 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6221410 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6221411 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6221412 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6221413 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6221414 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6221415 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6221416 cuando hice este lbum yo ven a de vivir cosas muy intensas como el xito repentino de per blue y una ruptura amorosa demasiado dolorosa entonces cuando termin de grabarlo me sent como se siente la persona al llegar a la orilla despu s de la tormenta

6221431 si miramos atr s creo que no debimos haber sido tan tajantes
6221432 debimos habernos tranquilizado un poco y habernos tomado un tiempo para ser honestos
6221433 pero obviamente todos ten amos una gran ansia por reunirnos o de lo contrario no habr a ocurrido espero que no rompamos de nuevo ahora porque es un poco tonto
6221434 ser a final de a o o a comienzos del pr ximo

6221450 the worst is yet to come in the u s
6221451 the financial sector needs to shrink i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job
6221452 they need to be nationalized the equity holders should lose all their money probably we need to guarantee the bonds simply because the u s has led everyone into believing they would guarantee the bonds
6221453 like any shrinking industries we are going to see the exit of some major players
6221454 were really going to see a consolidation even among the major investment banks
6221455 the only way to put discipline into the system is to allow some companies to go bust
6221456 you cant just have an industry where they make giant profits or they get bailed out
6221457 we need to create a resolution process that ensures the financial system can withstand the failure of a large complex financial firm

6221471 theres another shoe to drop ahead of us and it could be more severe
6221472 is up to about 50 billion and will probably top 100 billion before its over
6221473 those firms merrill wachovia and others are going to have to raise that cash
6221474 they are either going to have to get it from the federal reserve through some direct or indirect means which means more leverage more fed balance sheet more regular oversight or theyre going to have to get it in the capital markets
6221475 but a thousand banks is going to be a lot
6221476 each dollar of bank equity that gets lost takes out about 12 or 13 dollars of loans so theres a tremendous magnifier effect of small changes in bank equity
6221477 we will likely see more insolvencies among small u s regional banks that have focused on mortgage business
6221478 were it not for government aid and backing they would have already had to declare bankruptcy their portfolios have problems
6221479 we never really want to set a sound for ourselves because we never know what its gonna be like until were done it just sort of happens

6221566 we were listening to the piece about cindy mccain on npr all things considered and it just struck us very hard
6221567 im an only child my father was a cowboy and he really loved me very much but i think he wanted a son occasionally
6221568 im angry it makes me feel like a nonperson kind of
6221569 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
6221570 what she found in town on the day of or the day before or the day after his funeral was that the credit card didnt work anymore
6221571 the fact that weve never been recognized and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true recently again and again its just very very hurtful
6221572 its just another pr stunt for them to gain more press for her album
6221573 barking up the wrong tree regarding the issue of our falling population
6221574 our pursuit of economic excellence and rewards in the past 40 years has resulted in a new breed of young singaporeans who hold different values about life
6221575 while much of the blame has been pinned on our stop at two policy in the 70s the truth has to do with changing lifestyles rather than the success of that policy
6221576 while monetary incentives help in some way towards boosting the birth rate its effectiveness is suspect because the underlying problem is the changed attitude towards marriage and family life
6221577 the sense of entitlement and selfishness demonstrated by that young woman may have been extreme but i do think that the attitude is commonplace
6221578 parents play a big part in how children turn out but we cannot underestimate external factors such as societys influence peer pressure and the education system while our education system helps students excel in academics what sort of values does it promote
6221579 open skies liberalisation across the atlantic and pacific oceans are also beginning to have an effect and will consolidate demand for travel to the us if upward pressure of jet fuel prices continues to ease
6221580 truly staggering figures come from the spend side of the equation
6221581 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program
6221582 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
6221583 we are waiting for them to come back with the law in english
6221584 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
6221585 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
6221586 most working families today do not have homes that have anywhere near ten rooms
6221587 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
6221588 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that
6221589 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
6221590 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
6221591 that which is hateful to you do not do to another the rest of the torah is all commentary now go study
6221592 audio panton cogito singularis listen to everything think for yourself
6221593 horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
6221594 neoconservative commentator robert kagan compared the russian attack on georgia with the nazi grab of the sudetenland in 1938
6221595 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
6221596 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
6221597 this is a work of art not a lesson its aim is both to move the audience and to educate them
6221598 now you can say this is a perfect marriage between these two art forms just as the marriage of princess wencheng and king songtsen gampo was a marriage between the chinese and tibetan peoples
6221599 this is a chance to publicise tibetan opera which we dont have so many opportunities to show to the world and to foreigners
6221600 what choice do i have it wasnt so popular among all people in tibet
6221601 vi o ladr o tentar levar meu teclado que fica na sala fui direto para o quarto e peguei meu rev lver calibre 22
6221602 quando o encarei perguntei o que ele estava fazendo na minha casa ele ficou apenas repetindo que n o tinha feito nada
6221603 certainly this is the kind of political approach we favour
6221604 every country places on the record its views but no one blocks the decision and at the end the germans as chair declare the text adopted
6221605 we will make our presentation explaining our policy restating our bottom line and answering any questions
6221606 the dispute over the land allocated for the facilities to be provided to the amarnath yatris should be amicably settled through dialogue
6221607 there are ways in which the issue can be resolved but it is unfortunately being utilised to meet political ends which is dangerous and highly condemnable
6221608 i extracted some hair from the alleged corpse and examined it and had some concerns
6221609 we burned said sample and said hair sample melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair
6221610 at that time we contacted searching for bigfoot ceo tom biscardi who was present at the press conference who gave us permission to begin an expedited melting process
6221611 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head as i was now able to touch it i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
6221612 as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6221613 later that day tom biscardi informed us that both matthew whitton and ricky dyer admitted it was a costume
6221614 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time
6221615 it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud in a felonious manner
6221616 its all about money with him it probably didnt matter to him whether it was real or not
6221617 mr whitton and mr dyer probably started out small as a way to promote their bigfoot tracking business and got in way over their heads
6221618 it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud in a felonious manner
6221619 theres going to come a point in time where everybodys on the list
6221620 it was wrong im sorry and ill never do it again
6221621 backtrack from the gift of islam given to us by mir syed ali hamdani 650 years ago
6221622 i would like to urge all countries who have not yet signed the treaty including india pakistan and dprk north korea to do so and for all others to ratify it as soon as they can
6221623 dreamer of this dream of a ban on all nuclear tests
6221624 of course china should not wait to ratify but from chinas point of view u s ratification would be important
6221625 and then there are the statements to the u n and the indian parliament by the former prime minister that india will not stand in the way of the ctbt entering into force
6221626 jack johnson slc concert review part i setting the stage
6221627 while welcoming the fact that the ceasefire plan has now been signed by both the russian federation and georgia the secretary general stressed the need for it to be implemented and for all forces to immediately withdraw
6221628 with all his interlocutors the secretary general has reiterated the importance of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
6221629 while it would be good to do this in one sitting in all likelihood there will probably have to be a second round of discussions
6221630 in effect we only have a day and half now and that may not be enough time
6221631 it is easier to work the political side of this deal than dealing with technical level players whose attitudes tend to be more rigid
6221632 and at the end of the day that is not going to be acceptable to us
6221633 we know the u s has been extensively consulting with a number of nsg members and probably has a sheet of paper with a bunch of conditions that it will say the others want
6221634 the u s likes to have its own rules and grant waiver authority to the president so it will not want the nsg to adopt something which will make it mandatory for the u s to act in a particular way if something happens between india and another supplier
6221635 i think for them the big fear is enrichment and reprocessing equipment
6221636 they have decided they will never give it to india but if tomorrow the russians or french throw in some enr equipment as a sweetener for a reactor contract which u s suppliers wont be able to do they fear others will have a commercial advantage
6221637 we have sent several mails to the tatas but they have been avoiding us
6221638 it can be clearly established that the port limits of the upcoming dhamra port are clearly outside the turtle nesting area as well as the national marine sanctuary and the bhitarkanika national park this has also been confirmed by the national environmental appellate authority who had visited the site tata steel has had discussions with greenpeace on the dhamra port and the issue of turtles all issues stand clarified tata steel would be willing to engage in further discussions should greenpeace desire to do so
6221639 its always good to be proactive and weve got plenty of people who can help you

6221645 no i was worried after the semis but i just told myself to leave everything on the track i had come here to do it and i am so happy with myself
6221646 i never expected this i knew the track was a fast track but i didnt think this was possible i am shocked i am still shocked i have been aspiring for the world record for so long
6221647 i worked so hard to become the champion i will work harder to stay on the top
6221648 i have dreamt about it a million times i wanted to be victorious in this race it is a great blessing to all jamaican people it is god who has given us all the talent to do all that we did in the olympics we have to be grateful
6221649 i am really happy to win a medal for india all credit goes to my coaches and my parents especially my father who went to a far away temple to pray for my success since my teammates akhil kumar and jitender kumar had lost i was keen to win a medal
6221650 i had studied him well by watching his videos my strategy was to watch attack and defend
6221651 vijender fought very well he was brilliant his opponent was a good boxer and he has done well to win a medal he fought with skill used his mind and body as well it was really fantastic to watch him in action in such an important bout our strategy was to counter attack and to keep him fresh
6221652 the problem was that he took the lead first and it became difficult for me to overcome him in the later stages of the bout things would have been different had i taken the lead
6221653 i was asked to go all out by the coaches in the third round but i was worried about the stitches below my chin if i had got hit and started oozing blood from the chin the referee would have stopped the fight i had to be careful and the psychological barrier was more difficult to overcome than facing the opponent
6221654 the strike was spontaneous with eight crore people participating in it it is an expression of deep indignation of the masses against the pernicious economic and labour policies of the united progressive alliance government
6221655 this should be a warning bell for the government because if it does not respond we will prolong this agitation the sponsoring committee of trade unions will meet again in september first week to chalk out further course of action
6221656 the government should realise that all the friends of american president george bush are gone and it should be ready to face the same fate if it tries to suppress the masses
6221657 you should give yours first if you are a gentleman

6221660 the scam involves a person or persons entering a businesses and stealing the businesss debit pin pad and replacing it with a dummy pin pad that records the users card and pin number information they can then return and switch the pin pads again taking the dummy pin pad and its collected information they then use this information to make new debit cards to access your account make purchases and steal your money
6221661 some of these bogus pads are blue tooth enabled which allows the suspects to transmit the information to someone who might be sitting in a car in the parking lot with a laptop
6221662 if they have wireless technology they will transmit it immediately to someone who is fraudulently creating cards

6221695 government officials who continue to promote fluoridation must testify under oath as to why they are ignoring the powerful evidence of harm in the nrc report
6221696 it is time for the us to recognize that fluoridation has serious risks that far outweigh any minor benefits and unlike many other environmental issues its as easy to end as turning off a valve at the water plant

6221750 was attractive to us because the 91 eastbound traffic backs up into orange county
6221751 to be fair its a small minority that really dont like the art style
6221752 a majority of the feedback weve gotten has been overwhelmingly positive about the art style i think when they see the final game theyll find its probably a bit darker than they might think what weve shown is the earliest parts of the game meant to be a little sunnier and brighter than the later because were trying to set a juxtaposition and make everything feel worse as the game move on in terms of the actual art style we went through three full art revisions where we essentially hit the reset button on all the art and started over again and one of the main reasons was when we tried to go towards what our memory of diablo ii was we found that it created a drab boring game that didnt play very well
6221753 one of the things i try to remind people who talk about the art style and what diablo ii looked like is theyre being very selective in their memory theyre remembering small parts of act i and small parts of act iii and conveniently forgetting all the green fields of act i and all of act ii which is actually one of the most popular acts the general kind of almost garish look of the monsters really made them stand out and those things made the game play really well they were actually criticized at the time when diablo ii came out it was panned for being too bright and cheerful compared to the original diablo of course the original diablo drew like little red lines around the enemies so you could actually see them
6221754 it doesnt make it play like a better action game it just kind of gives the player infinite health its actually a fairly poor recovery mechanic because it forces the designers to design monsters that have to deal with a player that has infinite health the only thing you can do is have monsters that can overcome that health and essentially one shot you thats not a very interesting monster its actually a horrible monster but thats the only option the design shoehorned the designers into that kind of monster design so we focused on a health system that actually forces the player to think tactically to recover health from monsters and to put them in some situations where they are low on health but have to walk into an enemy encounter anyway that makes for a much more challenging encounter but it also makes for a situation where we can design the monsters to be a lot more interesting we actually can lower damage on monsters we want monsters to do less damage because we want them to wear you down over time and do things that are challenging in different ways
6221755 its perfect you know all well maybe do is tweak some little things that we dont like about it some systems that we think were maybe a little broken but for the most part it works really well and we dont really want to change it but the combat oh that could be so much better
6221756 the goal is to have players use skills where previously they would have used a potion
6221757 if ive got to deal with an enemy im going to go in stun a whole bunch of guys and circumnavigate them to reach a health orb or im going to stun them and take out a bunch of guys with the hope that im going to get a health orb and if i dont ill use some other kind of mechanic to deal with that threat
6221758 the one really great thing that most people wouldnt argue with was the grid based system allowed for very large icons which made the items feel better so one of the things we dont like about the current inventory is the icons are smaller than wed like them to be so were working on sizing up the icons themselves to be very large much larger than say world of warcraft weve experimented with other things like having different bag types hold different kinds of items like big items go into this bag and small items go into this bag but we havent really settled on anything like that what we dont want is the grid based tetris sort of system
6221759 i dont know if i can think of a comparison
6221760 i think that system is a pretty cool and different kind of system from anything that weve had before
6221761 i dont think were going to have anything quite as out there as diablo iis arcane sanctuary id say the scale and scope of the game in terms of the threat you end up facing is much much higher than the previous games i think if you look at the cinematic trailer theres never really been an invasion of sanctuary and i think from the trailer its obvious thats where were headed a lot of what happened in the original diablo was very small in scope even in diablo ii you traveled all over the world like youre really just facing the aftermath of diablo walking through the world there was a bit of it with lord of destruction baals invasion was sizable but we really want to go more higher than that thats about as detailed as i can be without giving away key story elements
6221762 our leaning tends to be towards people playing together over always maintaining coherency of story because thats the big problem if you join into my game and im three quests ahead of you we dont want you to feel like oh i dont want to play with you because youre three quests ahead of me so what we try to do is lean more toward okay you can get done everything from this point on and then you can come back in a previous game and finish these other things thats the one advantage the diablo series has people are used to returning to games to get things done kind of like in an mmo where you return to a zone to finish that one quest that you couldnt do because your friend didnt have it we dont want you to lose anything by playing with someone else

6221776 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
6221777 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
6221778 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
6221779 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
6221780 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
6221781 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
6221782 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
6221783 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
6221784 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
6221785 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
6221786 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
6221787 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
6221788 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
6221789 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
6221790 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
6221791 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
6221792 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
6221793 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
6221794 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
6221795 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
6221796 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
6221797 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
6221798 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
6221799 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
6221800 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
6221801 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
6221802 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
6221803 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
6221804 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
6221805 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
6221806 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
6221807 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6221808 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6221809 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance
6221810 theres not too much you can do to be honest with you
6221811 he has to do it himself thats how i see it ive talked to him he knows what he needs to do and hopefully hell do it
6221812 its their team theyre going to make decisions that they think are best and marvin and the players and all the coaches do the best with what weve got
6221813 his goal is to be ready to play when we go to baltimore so well see but right now hes surprisingly doing better than expected
6221814 i hope he can stay out of trouble and not anything about his football career just can make it and get through and not have any problems
6221815 its nice to give somebody a second chance a third chance i just hope he makes it
6221816 to have him back is no surprise as far as the things hes capable of doing
6221817 its just whether hes willing to go out and do the things he needs to do to be on this team thats take care of his business off the field and on the field talking to him on tuesday thats where he seems to be at hes in high spirits and he seems to have learned his lesson
6221818 mr brown can do what he wants to do im happy for chris that he has this opportunity hopefully he makes the most of it
6221819 if they bring a knife to the fight we bring a gun
6221820 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6221821 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6221822 it was one of washingtons biggest scandals and the republican power broker ralph reed was in the middle of it in deep with convicted felon and lobbyist jack abramoff
6221823 but when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify and that senator john mccain and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed for 26 years in washington john mccains played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same
6221824 because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6221825 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6221826 i didnt watch him but it was good to have him out there
6221827 so well evaluate the tape and see how he feels tomorrow it was good to have him out there today
6221828 pimstein was able to convince a couple people there to use their computers to control the bank accounts that he laundered the money through
6221829 it was about making money and then it turned into pimstein being the center of attention
6221830 him being important to these people that were friends he played baseball with them he knows their kids in some cases
6221831 i cant believe somebody would go to so much trouble to try to take advantage of you
6221832 one time we met just me pimstein and weber at the university of miami conference room
6221833 it was specifics about what the interest rate was going to be they wanted me to be on the board of directors of this company
6221834 some dipped into their 401 k for the quick turn around
6221835 he or she got points got a percentage off the top of all their investors so they would solicit more investors
6221836 a classic ponzi scheme a fraudulent investment operation that involves paying earlier investors from the principal of later investors rather than from profits generated from real business
6221837 i dont believe you needed the money to do this so why why did you do this
6221838 in reality pimstein and the bottom line had no business relationship with ripley
6221839 he does not seek a public airing of his loss but does not want his business or reputation damaged by association
6221840 he would have just stopped at nothing to get any cent he could out of anybody
6221841 it delayed a lot of folks getting to where they had to go yesterday
6221842 apparently the tsa inspector hoisted himself up using the tat probe as a stirrup
6221843 we caught it this time but who knows if this has happened other times and with other planes that are out there
6221844 pilots are the last line of defense we do our pre flight inspections but we dont have a system in place to check for broken parts
6221845 it is not tsas intent to cause delays or potential damage to aircraft as a result of our inspections
6221846 the inspector was able to gain access to the interior of seven of the nine aircraft inspected which is an apparent violation of the airlines security program
6221847 tsa is reviewing the inspection results and depending on the conclusion could take action with the airline up to and including levying of civil penalties
6221848 is confident that it followed all proper security procedures for securing aircraft overnight at chicagos ohare international airport
6221849 if not observed by vigilant eagle employees in chicago the actions of this inspector would have been unknown and could have jeopardized the safety of our customers and crew
6221850 to look for and test among other things access vulnerabilities or areas were someone with ill intent could gain access to the aircraft
6221851 aircraft operators are required to secure each aircraft when left unattended
6221852 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
6221853 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
6221854 take the famous ice core data this was the jewel in the crown of global warming theory al gore said it proved a link between carbon dioxide and temperature he failed to mention that in the data the connection was clearly the wrong way round temperature driving co2 levels not the other way round
6221855 while we continue to improve the performance of our wastewater system and spills have declined dramatically we have always accepted full responsibility for spills from our wastewater system and have taken precautions to protect the public in every case
6221856 butter is 80 percent fat and oil and 20 percent water and protein
6221857 what we have to do is render it heat it to separate the fats and oils from the water and protein
6221858 we are trying to bring the agreement to a close it is not done yet
6221859 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6221860 i ask you to seek these opportunities when you leave here
6221861 the future of this country your future depends on it
6221862 if college costs continue to escalate at this rate you may reach a point where the investment simply isnt worth it
6221863 only one of the ads also launches a character attack on the opponent there may be good reasons for this but its worth keeping in mind
6221864 when republicans imagine attacks they think in terms of character when democrats imagine attacks they think in terms of policy and record read that again its the key to presidential campaigns
6221865 barack obama promises to give everyone 1 million and a golden retriever
6221866 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6221867 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6221868 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6221869 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6221870 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia
6221871 no 5 year old child did the damage this little boy suffered
6221872 el panorama era desolador el fuselaje estaba destruido y el avi n creo que se ha incendiado hab a un kil metro de tierra quemada todo estaba destruido se ve a la cola separada del resto

6221875 essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus
6221876 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
6221877 that was not the bill that was presented at the state level
6221878 what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade
6221879 the words person human being child and individual shall include every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development
6221880 occurs as a result of natural or induced labor cesarean section or induced abortion
6221881 would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported
6221882 i dont know whether he is lying or whether he forgot but with his words he is condemning himself
6221883 he voted one way and then covered it up and he has to explain that not just to me but to the american people
6221884 on the childs behalf for damages including costs of care to preserve and protect the life health and safety of the child punitive damages and costs and attorneys fees against a hospital health care facility or health care provider who harms or neglects the child or fails to provide medical care to the child after the childs birth
6221885 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law

6221914 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of skin cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
6221915 so we think that this kind of biomarker could be used in a rapid and noninvasive way to detect skin cancer
6221916 and this would be novel because now the only way to do so is with a visual exam and a biopsy which is of course invasive
6221917 i tell my kid sister that she should act like a lady and not give her pussy away

6221919 its cool to say you live on south beach because everybody knows where it is and that its one of the hottest places in the country
6221920 if you have had preeclampsia you should be aware that you are at increased risk for renal and cardiovascular disease and you should try to reduce that risk
6221921 historically the thought was that after delivery everything was fine but preeclampsia isnt benign and it may initiate a cascade of damage that takes years to develop into clinically relevant renal disease
6221922 the take home message from this study is that any young woman who has had any variant of preeclampsia and eclampsia needs to be monitored for ongoing or recurrent kidney disease high blood pressure and diabetes
6221923 i usually dont get off when men are pounding hard on my breasts or squeezing or pinching them really hard just do it kindly and nicely to my nipples massage them im kind of sensitive underneath my boobs as well so just moving your hands back and forth under my boobs feels really good lick them but dont bite them and one of the other things is i have a hard time getting off when im on top unless the guy holds my breasts i like to grind when im riding a guys cock i like to move back and forth but the only way i can get off is if he has at least one hand on my boobs its always been like that for me unless im on the bottom in which case i can cum any way i want but when im on top i need to have that kind of sensitivity and stimulation but if he squeezes too hard i lose interest if a guy is nice to me while im riding him then i definitely cum
6221924 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6221925 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad alcohol dependence in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
6221926 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous miscarriage teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
6221927 professional sports stadiums are another place where theres a great likelihood of illegal alcohol sales
6221928 we know that we have problems with fans drinking too much and contributing to problems in and around stadiums we need to make sure we prevent these illegal sales from occurring
6221929 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6221930 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6221931 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6221932 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6221933 preterists claim many of the predicted visions were meant for people who first heard them preached 1
6221934 if john the baptist preached chapters 4 through 11 then these visions were meant for first century judeans not for gentiles living twenty centuries later 3
6221935 the judeans were supposed to recognize and accept the messiah but many did not it seems logical that those who did not accept the messiah would experience the disasters the baptist predicted 49
6221936 we have the guilt for all our sins because we willed to disobey but jesus in his divine nature is involved because we draw upon his power when we carry out our disobedience 15
6221937 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6221938 for this generation of teenagers were not going to have data for the next 15 or 20 years on how effective it a cervical cancer vaccine is what it changes about the dynamics of cervical cancer how long the vaccine lasts whether you can then extrapolate this to decreasing screening guidelines
6221939 we need more long term data from this generation of girls getting vaccinates now to make decisions on a population basis

6221942 we are thrilled to be collaborating with jewishgen an elite and well respected resource in the jewish genealogy community
6221943 both organizations are committed to the preservation of important historical records we look forward to working with jewishgen and to making these wonderful collections even more accessible for free on ancestry
6221944 this important partnership between jewishgen and ancestry com demonstrates a commitment both to preserving jewish heritage and providing the public with unprecedented access to these records
6221945 the impact on the genealogy community will be significant not only will genealogists now have the use of powerful search tools to make research easier they will be able to find everything for their jewish heritage research needs at one location
6221946 the continuity of jewish heritage is central to the museums mission we are pleased that this partnership will make it easier for users to discover their jewish roots and connect or re connect to their familys history

6221954 this compromise budget proposal puts our state on the road to fiscal sanity and will give california a budget that works
6221955 substituting one tax increase for another is not a bipartisan compromise nor will it solve our long term budget problems
6221956 increasing taxes on hard working californians whether temporary or permanent is not only unnecessary it is irresponsible
6221957 i have made it very clear that we cannot tax our way out of this problem i do not believe in tax increases
6221958 i think it is key for us that we finish this year with victories and not another year where nothing gets done just because everyone is stuck in their ideology

6222089 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
6222090 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
6222091 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
6222092 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
6222093 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
6222094 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
6222095 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6222096 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6222097 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
6222098 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
6222099 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
6222100 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means

6222108 i have not been able to enjoy life except in bilad al sham from mountain to mountain i used to escape with my religion oh shaqiq he is not noble in our eyes who is ennobled by hajj or jihad he is noble in our eyes who knows exactly what he puts into his mouth
6222109 bring me to him so that i may see him
6222110 i am so frigid and he is sleepless and unresting the whole night through come let us investigate his case
6222111 now you come and be my guest for forty days
6222112 shaytan was all the time going and coming in you as soon as you swallowed lawful food the manifestations he had been contriving in you became revealed for what they were the devils work
6222113 make sure your food is tayyib and you dont have to fast your days and stay up in your nights

6222122 the problem is that we do not create productive contexts for learning in which the needs of each child are met as their talent interest curiosity and passion are amplified the last thing we need is another sweeping top down reform
6222123 its hard to argue against raising educational standards but imposing uniform curricula and teaching practices leads to a paradoxical lowering of standards
6222124 perhaps the singular accomplishment of nclb is the erosion of community support for public education
6222125 as barack obama continues to remind voters in those equivocal yet reassuring tones of his why he is completely unqualified to be president john mccain shows why he should win this election by a landslide
6222126 the contrast between the two men during the forum at pastor rick warrens saddleback church was stunning as usual obama was tentative vague stammered through his answers and was simply wrong on every issue mccain was surprisingly quick sure of himself and knew exactly what he believed and why
6222127 on march 13 2003 illinois state legislator barack obama voted against the illinois born alive act which provides that infants who survive an abortion and are born alive should receive necessary medical care and treatment barack obama voted to let babies die who were born alive barack obama took a more extreme pro abortion stand than even pro abortion champions naral who stayed neutral on the counterpart federal legislation which barred abortions on babies born alive
6222128 in deep with convicted felon and lobbyist jack abramoff but when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify that senator john mccain and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed

6222132 this facility like those used by other central banks has been designed in case the global credit markets deteriorate further and make cash difficult to access but the likelihood of this being needed remains extremely low
6222133 i can assure you we are well aware of the cost for people who have been unfortunately caught up in the fallout
6222134 but it is important to keep a sense of perspective
6222135 the majority of institutions accounting for over 90 per cent of household financial assets are not directly affected by these current events these institutions are well capitalised businesses and give no apparent reason for concern
6222136 our banks are navigating their way through the current turmoil well
6222137 and you saw how well that goes over with the rick warren people
6222138 this ban on a legitimate medical procedure is clearly unconstitutional
6222139 because historically because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution

6222144 quantum of solace represents a new era for james bond video games allowing players to step into the role of daniel craigs 007 agent as embodied in casino royale and the upcoming bond film
6222145 with the tremendous support weve received from the film studio and unprecedented access to the key talent from the movie we are thrilled to be able to deliver a true more exciting bond universe to gamers and fans who have waited years for this game
6222146 bearing in mind that 2007 was a record year for emigration the fact that even more people are looking to move abroad this year shows that there is now a very real desire to escape some of the problems of the uk economy
6222147 he is a consummate professional both on the court and off who will provide us with additional depth in the frontcourt while also serving as a mentor to some of our younger players
6222148 i see here your team the scorpion deathcocks took the league championship in 2007 very impressive
6222149 i owe it all to the whitest man in the nfl kurt warner

6222152 there arent enough police to make enforcement work in a significant proportion of the city even in pasadena we had this same debate last year when we reviewed speed limits here
6222153 the ladot is following a manual put together by the california transportation department called the
6222154 its not that the bru considers sales taxes regressive its that everyone does economists
6222155 there arent enough police to make enforcement work in a significant proportion of the city
6222156 isnt the federal government talking about lowering speed limits to help fuel economy
6222157 reneau the only person inside the store and who carried a weapon alone made the decision to take keerans life mr wood was outside the store in his brothers truck
6222158 the state argued that he was responsible for keerans murder and portrayed wood as little more than a sap steamrolled by the villainous reneau
6222159 asked on death row last week to identify the shooter reneau had a one word reply me
6222160 prosecutors reversed their strategy arguing that wood deserved to die because hed gotten reneau to do his dirty work
6222161 bowing to mr woods emotional and irrational insistence mr woods appointed lawyers declined to cross examine any witnesses or present any evidence on mr woods behalf
6222162 not only did woods defense withhold from the jury evidence of his troubled youth but they also failed to cross examine any state witnesses including the wildly speculative testimony of dr james grigson derisively known by many including colleagues in the psychiatric community as dr death for predictably offering testimony in capital cases that a defendant would pose a danger to society one of the questions a jury must decide in order to impose a death sentence
6222163 this can mean sentencing someone to death even if he or she had no proven role in a murder
6222164 if in the attempt to carry out a conspiracy to commit one felony another felony is committed by one of the conspirators all conspirators are guilty of the felony actually committed though having no intent to commit it
6222165 conspiracy in fosters case the robberies for which he was the getaway driver would lead to a murder
6222166 they hate on my dad because they say he should have known better are they following the law to the letter or the letter to the law
6222167 it was not until just this morning that the mbta admitted what the students were doing isnt a prank if theres ever been a shoot the messenger case i guess this is it
6222168 weve always maintained that there are certain details that we didnt want to disclose because we dont want people defrauding the mbta
6222169 were definitely going to stay true to that weve always wanted to settle this amicably my god we never wanted any of this
6222170 and thus a nation of loud and proud rednecks was born

6222178 childrens grief is in many ways similar to grief experienced by adults
6222179 reactions are individual and may be experienced on many different levels
6222180 like adults children may experience physical aches and pains behavioral changes and inability to concentrate and a range of feelings including sadness anger guilt anxiety jealousy loneliness or even relief
6222181 they may struggle spiritually to understand and find some sense of meaning in the loss
6222182 as adults strive to help children through these challenging situations we would like to be a source of support
6222183 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6222184 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6222185 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6222186 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
6222187 devoted many hours to analyzing and improving the body structure safety belts and air bags of escape and mariner for better performance in front and side impact crashes
6222188 no single crash test provides a full picture of a vehicles crashworthiness

6222203 there were times in my past where i had experimented drugs and alcohol which leads me to ask the question is that flower realy there
6222204 look at that that would like really nice at john mccains memorial
6222205 hey send that on to senator mccain it would be a nice decoration at the memorial service for his political career
6222206 i remember my first prom but how in the world am i supposed to pin that thing on michelles gown

6222216 we continue to increase and broaden our portfolio of customer care solutions
6222217 ricks ability to provide quality service and support makes him an excellent selection for dinerware
6222218 the company has a great product and a loyal following of customers and partners part of my job here is to ensure the service and support offerings are very customer centered and continue to reflect a very positive experience in doing business with dinerware
6222219 one of our main challenges is locating the right person in our organisation to answer a customer query in a timely manner and then being able to contact them directly
6222220 this was underlined by a recent report that showed 20 percent of our contact centre agents time was spent looking for the right person in our organization to handle specific customer queries what we needed was a technology solution that would leverage our prior investment in a company wide videoconferencing system with new capability to unify voice video and customer information and provide personalised customer contact with improved customer service
6222221 nortel impressed us with the direct software integration between its communication network and microsofts office communications server software providing specific information about each of our expert resources available in real time to all of our branches
6222222 this gives us an incredibly powerful platform for connecting our people with our customers in a variety of different ways through audio video text and im and ensures that regardless of where our customers are located we have the resources available to serve them
6222223 were already looking past the initial implementation to the next phase of the project which will extend the reach of our video enabled unified communications services to our customers through the web
6222224 this will give customers direct access to our consultants through the video conferencing system presenting them with a new way of communicating directly with our staff without having to leave their homes
6222225 nortel and microsofts alliance gives them a clear time to market advantage thats well ahead of what any of their competitors could muster
6222226 it was also obvious that we were speaking the same language when it comes to reducing our carbon footprint through energy efficient technology and cutting back on unnecessary travel and it was also an easy sell to my cfo the operational savings weve calculated as a result of implementing this technology are substantial delivering significant customer service enhancement more efficiently will have lasting benefits on both our top and bottom line
6222227 nortels solution is helping necu overcome the challenges of one to one communication in an organisation that is spread across multiple branches some in remote rural areas
6222228 this unified communications approach will help necu stand out from the crowd as people look for different ways of collaborating with each other and their service organisations using multiple web enabled devices in todays era of hyperconnectivity when anything that can be connected to the network is being connected
6222229 we are extremely pleased with our third consecutive quarter over quarter growth
6222230 this further demonstrates the growing demand of the clearant process
6222231 this motion for contempt is without merit providing this notice is clearly a tactic employed by nuance in light of its failed proposal to acquire zi last week at a low valuation the timing of this motion is highly suspicious and is an unnecessary legal tactic by nuance we are disappointed that nuance is resorting to these kinds of tactics to acquire zi without recognizing its full value we will vigorously defend ourselves in this litigation proceeding we are examining all legal remedies available to us with respect to nuances tactics

6222233 others including the international olympic committee arrange their rankings by gold medals won
6222234 nobody in his right mind would claim that a country winning 15 silver medals should be ranked lower than a country winning a single gold medal
6222235 would rather live in the united states as a loser than in china as a winner
6222236 while many of taiwan s people are chinese migr s from the mainland or descendants of migr s the people native to the island are taiwanese
6222237 im better than you because the country i happen to be born in had other people born in who ive never met interacted with or seen other than in the newspaper or on the internet once or twice happen to have done a little better in an international sporting event than someone in your country
6222238 see the games as between athletes not countries nonetheless placed list countries in a order based on gold number too the ranking system used by most us media outlets to me is an unnecesary show of lack of confidence
6222239 the times is doing a much better job than 99 of the american media
6222240 taiwan an island which china regards as a breakaway province
6222241 the national media of all the countries who compete at these games display the medal table accordingly with the exception of the us
6222242 i do not know why non americans are so concerned about how the american media report the olympics to their own people
6222243 the us is probably the only country that refuses to get rid of english units of measurement
6222244 if the status quo of aboriginal economic and educational initiatives continues street gangs and violent activity will increase and already marginalized aboriginal populations will experience a diminishing quality of life
6222245 the fallout from aboriginal poverty is all too obvious and will only get worse
6222246 their spread from urban centres to reserves is not a sign of organizational growth but rather the continuing unhealthy social state of these communities
6222247 the rcmp has engaged in past initiatives directed at aboriginal people and we should play yet still a greater role if we want to make a difference in their communities as well as strengthen our understaffed ranks
6222248 such an initiative would be akin to the marshall plan that rebuilt europe in the 1950s
6222249 at the same time if these aboriginal candidates decided not to join the rcmp but go on to other careers this would still benefit their communities
6222250 its a partnership that has to develop with the communities
6222251 it is an incredible opportunity for me to get back to california and be closer to the farmers
6222252 each year the espys seem to grow in stature and prominence it is a great opportunity for our company to get the zirh brand into the hands of high profile professional athletes and to further build the brand and relationships within that community

6222279 paul is excited about going on tour initially he wanted to go it alone with just his band and road crew with family flying out every now and again but now he wants nancy to be with him all the way
6222280 he says he had the time of his life on the road trip with nancy i think it really sealed things for him he enjoys nancys company so much
6222281 we should like to take this opportunity to correct the historic omission which to our great regret occurred in 1965 when you were invited to israel
6222282 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6222283 we want to be on location there are many questions
6222284 watching television can slow the development of children under three even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them
6222285 television viewing hurts the development of children under three years old and poses a certain number of risks encouraging passivity slow language acquisition over excitedness troubles with sleep and concentration as well as dependence on screens
6222286 the obvious risk that we always think about is pregnancy but thats only one small risk of unprotected intercourse they bear the burden of the risk if they have a sexually transmitted disease
6222287 in a man its treatable in a woman although we say its treatable it can leave consequences such as infertility
6222288 we do know from other studies that individuals who are in shorter term relationships are more likely to use a condom than individuals in longer term relationships
6222289 its possible that youth between the ages of 18 and 19 are in longer term relationships and therefore they perceive their risk for sexually transmitted disease infection to be lower and so unfortunately theyre not using a condom

6222292 it was a difficult night playing against a good team early on in the season and most of us played on sunday
6222293 it was a tough game but we got a good draw against a good side but we are disappointed not to have won
6222294 but we havent been beaten we are building our confidence and getting stronger
6222295 im a winger but the manager wanted me to play off the frontman
6222296 new manager and new ideas weve got to try things
6222297 we played very well in the first half we had a lot of chances to score
6222298 im happy because we played for a long time for an hour good i liked it
6222299 but the czech counter attack was very dangerous and we need to work on that
6222300 i learned things that when the other team counter attack we have problems
6222301 we are just starting the season and some players are not at the top physically and im sure in the next game we will be better but im happy that we played better we took another step forward
6222302 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6222303 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6222304 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6222305 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show
6222306 it is important to do that when the business of the qualifying campaign begins and we are keen to make up for what happened last time
6222307 it has been a problem for the past four or five years and its something we need to address as quickly as possible
6222308 i dont know what it is and as a group we are trying to put our fingers on it
6222309 we have some players who are playing brilliantly for their clubs and if we can address that we will be going in the right direction but its not something we can change overnight
6222310 was flawed and didnt serve consumers so it is not surprising that he took actions to block its enactment or impede its implementation
6222311 the most fundamental information technological revolution in the history of mankind
6222312 to let competition grow on the basis of fair access to the monopoly market
6222313 its no wonder that the phone companies and their lobbyists have raised and contributed millions to senator mccain
6222314 he has gotten too close to the lobbyists for industries over which he has had regulatory power trust buster teddy roosevelt whom mccain calls a hero would be rolling in his grave
6222315 has never taken legislative action on behalf of any special interest
6222316 i think the fcc would have had a good chance of getting the d c circuit reversed
6222317 porque deben ustedes recordar que en aquellos tiempos de burda reproducci n viv para los ni os eran criados siempre con sus padres y no en los centros de condicionamiento del estado

6222320 obviously they are our public safety personnel weve entrusted them with the highest authority as city of austin protectors and defenders and with that authority comes responsibility
6222321 i didnt see or hear anything that led me to believe they were against this proposal
6222322 its all about accountability when youre representing people and taking care of people
6222323 were out there everyday arresting drug dealers and people that are using drugs
6222324 i have been a dolly fan all of my life shes a wonderful woman i really connect with her music i cant think of a better role model for my children
6222325 she has this great sweet personality but shes also strong and wise
6222326 it legitimizes the game for a lot of viewers who now realize you can walk out with the top prize
6222327 you can hear our crew screaming in the background we are rooting for everyone who gets on that show and theres nothing more thrilling than to see someone walk away with a life changing amount of money
6222328 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
6222329 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
6222330 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
6222331 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6222332 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6222333 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6222334 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6222335 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6222336 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6222337 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6222338 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6222339 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6222340 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6222341 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6222342 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6222343 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6222344 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6222345 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6222346 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6222347 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6222348 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6222349 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6222350 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6222351 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6222352 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6222353 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6222354 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6222355 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6222356 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6222357 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6222358 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6222359 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6222360 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
6222361 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
6222362 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6222363 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6222364 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
6222365 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
6222366 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years
6222367 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
6222368 we want all our personnel to know that health and security are the companys highest priorities
6222369 we are working with the algerian authorities to ensure the safety of our staff
6222370 the terrorists should know that the only way for them is to give themselves up
6222371 as the president of the republic has said many times the state will unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6222372 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation chosen by the nation and which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the national territory
6222373 sincere condolences to the families who lost loved ones and to the people of algeria
6222374 these criminals and thugs must be stopped and the united states will continue working with algeria in close cooperation on counterterrorism measures
6222375 the uk united kingdom government fully supports the government of algeria in its fight against terrorism and condemns the attacks that have taken place in algeria in the last two days
6222376 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
6222377 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh

6222411 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6222412 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6222413 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6222414 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6222415 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia
6222416 if you can picture the console that a communicator is in front of to the side there is literally a flip chart which the operators go through so its literally these national protocol of questions sitting right at their console and the operator walks through them one by one
6222417 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6222418 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6222419 i have never suggested that picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6222420 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6222421 i mean have you been in terre haute watching practice you can write what you see thats the best way i can tell you
6222422 you all seem to know more about it you all write what you see that way i wont have a comment
6222423 then sometimes you walk out with that knife in your back sometimes editors note or as the case may be a bullet in your hand ill just say nothing there will be better days down the line but i have nothing right now

6222426 the social and portable inbox optimizing e mail marketing in the new era of communication tools
6222427 we wanted to win the match and worked a lot to clinch the win
6222428 of course a draw with one of the worlds best football teams is a positive result but theres no reason for euphoria its only a draw we still need to work hard to achieve something serious
6222429 this is a huge milestone in dtscs efforts to protect public health and the environment in east palo alto
6222430 our scientists and engineers scrutinized the plans for closure to verify that every task involved was appropriately protective and would lead to successful dismantling of the facility
6222431 the 200 metres record has been my dream since i was 15 when i was the youngest ever person to win the world junior title it is my first love
6222432 i have been saying all season to everyone that the 200 metres means a lot more to me than the 100
6222433 a lot of people compare me to michael johnson i dont compare myself to anyone else i am just me he is a great athlete but i am just happy with what i am doing here
6222434 i have no regrets about the 100 metres i just wanted to win the race and i had done the work
6222435 but i knew i could break the 200m record so i left everything out on the track
6222436 i knew i could go that fast i have shown the potential all season but to do that after seven rounds of sprinting is a surprise
6222437 i knew if i was going to get it it would be here because the track is so fast i just gave it everything i had
6222438 i just want to go to bed and let it start to sink in that i am a world record holder
6222439 maybe tomorrow i will be able to explain how i feel but right now i am just lost for words
6222440 i just want to chill out and sleep i wish it was the weekend so i could chill out in some sandals
6222441 drogba will not be back before a month a month and a half
6222442 he has started to run but he will not be available for the match against mozambique a 2010 world cup qualifier september 5
6222443 i know john mccain i know his love of country he will choose the best person and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6222444 im satisfied with the result and felt my players did not perform badly i have been with the team only one week and still experimenting with different formations
6222445 poland did very well to come back and played very well defensively bt we did well not to lose concentration
6222446 its brazil or china next on paper it would be better to have china but thats unlikely it will probably be brazil
6222447 i cant say that we managed to fully cope with the bulgarians especially kaziyski
6222448 in the first set we were just waking up but after that we managed to play collectively
6222449 as for bulgaria they can play one very good game in any tournament and i was praying before the game that it wouldnt be against us
6222450 no more dithering no more delaying no more excuses this is the report that they called for they said their decision would hinge on the reports recommendations so with its release the opposition have got to come forward and state their position

6222456 the guy who got me to open face stockholm was a kiwi
6222457 more than 25 years ago we met in new york and he began talking about medicines and chemicals and all that stuff
6222458 and it was fun i was fed up with selling all these jeans i was 40 years old i wasnt planning to make it big i just wanted to visit new york to go back and forth on tax deductible business trips

6222461 thats not true people usually just go in and see the colours they dont see the skincare they see the lipsticks and the nail polish we have a big range of products more than 1000 units

6222466 women here tend to wear a lot more makeup christchurch women wear more colour than aucklanders do they arent afraid of colour thats why were not big on naked naked doesnt sell
6222467 the must buys this summer are a dress and colour
6222468 at a time like this when everyone is predicting economic gloom we need to be more on our game and give women a reason to buy we need to enthuse and excite them
6222469 were a ready to wear designer that uses great fabrics and interesting shapes to make women look and feel good
6222470 ours have more colour and shape than the shift dresses weve seen the past few summers the look is chic and has more impact
6222471 dresses are a great buy because they are feminine good for different body shapes and you dont have to think too much about your outfit just slip it on and youre ready you can dress it up with makeup and heels
6222472 i was at a fashion show in sydney recently and there were all these very short dresses on the catwalk the woman next to me had a fabulous figure but she was not impressed at the showing and wondered where anyone could wear such short dresses
6222473 women say they want jackets they can wear on the weekend as well as to work so we change our designs to suit
6222474 david jones has revamped its designer floor and only three new zealand designers made the cut trelise cooper sabatini and ashley fogel they are pleased with our consistent performance so have doubled the size of our area and given us a prime position in the new zealand designer label department
6222475 its the kind of thing thats easier to see when its the mote in someone elses eye but
6222476 can you imagine what 300 billion brought into our economy to be used here create jobs jobs pay taxes and the economy rolls forward
6222477 if you were to lower it from 70 to 66 you would lower your consumption by 13 percent that would offset some of the price
6222478 the government has conveyed to me that the issuance of an arrest warrant against president bashir could have serious consequences for u n staff and infrastructure in sudan
6222479 we are taking all necessary precautionary measures including strengthening our cooperation with sudanese security institutions
6222480 the fact of the matter is that there was a breakdown of local instructions of high officials were simply ignored by local commanders
6222481 when two regular armies fight each other with tanks multi barrel rocket launchers artillery and heavy machine guns then irrespective of the specific number of peacekeepers assigned to abyei there is no way they can actively intervene to suppress the fighting
6222482 how long did it take you to think up that question
6222483 one of the major planks of the republican attack on obama is going to be his lack of foreign policy experience
6222484 and so i think he needs somebody who can be very strong in defending the obama ticket in appearing in that vice presidential debate and putting the strongest voice forward for the democratic ticket
6222485 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats what i can tell you
6222486 i must say thats a good question i will tell you that during this campaign ive learned some things about him about the kind of environment from which he came ideologically and i wouldnt id hesitate to say hes a marxist but hes got some positions that are far to the left of me and i think mainstream america
6222487 a totalitarian system of government in which a single authoritarian party controls state owned means of production with the professed aim of establishing a stateless society
6222488 were going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good
6222489 from each according to his ability to each according to his need
6222490 but under the name of liberalism they will adopt every fragment of the socialist program until one day america will be a socialist nation without knowing how it happened
6222491 fox news how much discretion u n s anti poverty program wants unlimited spending power
6222492 payments which are made where there is no legal liability to undp but the moral obligation justifies making such payments which are in the interest of undp
6222493 your daddy is down there supporting the danish government and the danish government is supporting bush
6222494 i was nearly knocked down there once so when the police van went the wrong way i sort of said hey mate no entry but he just shouted out of the window expletive off this is police business
6222495 it was very frightening all i had done was photograph these police officers doing something illegal but i was the one who ended up being arrested
6222496 theres not too much you can do to be honest with you
6222497 he has to do it himself thats how i see it ive talked to him he knows what he needs to do and hopefully hell do it
6222498 its their team theyre going to make decisions that they think are best and marvin and the players and all the coaches do the best with what weve got
6222499 his goal is to be ready to play when we go to baltimore so well see but right now hes surprisingly doing better than expected
6222500 i hope he can stay out of trouble and not anything about his football career just can make it and get through and not have any problems
6222501 its nice to give somebody a second chance a third chance i just hope he makes it
6222502 to have him back is no surprise as far as the things hes capable of doing
6222503 its just whether hes willing to go out and do the things he needs to do to be on this team thats take care of his business off the field and on the field talking to him on tuesday thats where he seems to be at hes in high spirits and he seems to have learned his lesson
6222504 mr brown can do what he wants to do im happy for chris that he has this opportunity hopefully he makes the most of it
6222505 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl
6222506 this compromise budget proposal puts our state on the road to fiscal sanity and will give california a budget that works
6222507 substituting one tax increase for another is not a bipartisan compromise nor will it solve our long term budget problems
6222508 increasing taxes on hard working californians whether temporary or permanent is not only unnecessary it is irresponsible
6222509 i have made it very clear that we cannot tax our way out of this problem i do not believe in tax increases
6222510 i think it is key for us that we finish this year with victories and not another year where nothing gets done just because everyone is stuck in their ideology
6222511 i keep hammering away at them every time i talk to them let us get together let us work this out dont come to the table with the same stubborn position
6222512 the republicans came in with the mantra no taxes no taxes no taxes and then the democrats came in and said no cuts no cuts you cant continue this way
6222513 better to eat well and eat alone than eat dull food with strangers
6222514 cant be bothered to cook the stuff that goes with meat
6222515 het heeft mijn kijk op het leven veranderd ook al zijn we eerder door een diep dal gegaan
6222516 liberal activists have treated american energy like a four letter word for decades even though its the key to our prosperity and our high standards of living in the united states
6222517 these individuals and organizations would have american citizens believe that their country is running out of oil and natural gas that what does remain cannot be produced safely and that development would only have a negligible effect on price these assertions are patently false

6222541 with apple shapes where people tend to have large waists with skinny legs and hips the risk of high cholesterol and heart disease is higher what weve found is that the fat tissue that lines the abdomen the adipose fat is high in the inflammatory markers that lead to heart and cholesterol problems
6222542 as women age their cholesterol profile changes because as estrogen levels go down the hdl or good cholesterol also goes down and the ldl or the bad cholesterol goes up
6222543 in men the low testosterone levels that sometimes occur in 50s and 60s can increase the risk for heart disease pre diabetes and insulin resistance
6222544 during this time we also see an increase in abdominal fat so its actually the opposite of women where we see a decrease in estrogen causing an increase in adipose fat

6222848 has sort of been the anti sports sport for quite a while
6222849 our search to date has been concentrated in the dallington area however we are now interested in sightings of a woman of this description anywhere over christchurch including the inner city
6222850 we ask anyone in the vicinity of gayhurst road to check their properties in case she has taken shelter in an outside shed or garage
6222851 over the years weve had hundreds of people work on the game and we thank everyone who helped us bring our warhammer passion to life but only current employees that have continued until the end will be credited in the final game
6222852 accreditation in warhammer online recognizes the incredible team that has poured their heart and soul into making war an amazing mmorpg experience
6222853 this has been an ongoing problem in this industry for many years i spent three years on war and i including many other people who spent just as much if not close to the same amount of time will not be credited in the game
6222854 any person who has contributed to the production of the game for at least 30 days of a 12 month or greater project or any person who has contributed during 10 of the projects total time in development for projects shorter than 12 months
6222855 we have demonstrated that in a cohort of patients with complex coronary lesion morphology the implantation of both novel pf and bp des platforms is feasible and that the 1 year safety data are similar to that of the cypher stent
6222856 biodegradable coatings for controlled cytostatic drug release may well be the next step towards more sophisticated des platforms providing more optimal dosage and duration of the pharmacologic drug effect
6222857 how important this step will be in our challenge for an even better future for coronary patients undergoing pci remains to be seen
6222858 its the first of its kind search engine for our community its not a website a search engine it is a place where we can come and find anything that we currently get from google yahoo and msn you can now find it at a place thats made for us by us its a hot new product we have all the jobs in the world we crawl the world wide web for jobs and cutting edge news not just black news but the latest news
6222859 were on a promotional tour we started in chicago went to nashville atlanta cincinnati l a things are good god is good
6222860 we can spread a rumor in a second its time to spread some good news
6222861 and the good news is we finally have our own search engine im pleased to say at the end of our second full operating month we had 800 000 unique visitors so business is good but we need more of em
6222862 the notion came upon me that anybody can search but i was having great difficulty finding things that matter to us
6222863 youd like to think things like cancer are race neutral but cancer is black or white how we get it the things that impact how black people deal with the treatment regimen all that is different i looked for it but there is really nothing that spoke to how black men deal with it so i said gosh it would be great if we could merge all the stuff from the national cancer society the national institute of health all the right places the authorities but also get that information that is specifically relevant to black people because then we are making a difference knowledge is power i really believe that
6222864 google has much of the information that we have but its on page 50 its on page 100 its on page 1 000 what we do is elevate the black results to the first three pages which differentiates us
6222865 everyone thought what we would simply do is take a term like comedy and prefix black or african american but you find out very quickly that black comedy on a search engine does not give you martin lawrence and eddie murphy it gives you dark humor so its not as simple as prefixing black and african american to your search terms there is a real algorithm
6222866 it is the first time the african american community has a legitimate technology play a search engine
6222867 i liked it because it was easy to spell and the action words rush for more information and you drive the web instead of searching the web

6222898 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
6222899 so the next president cant do a damn thing about unraveling this disaster which is appropriately enough an embryonic police state

6222954 president kim pointed outside and said that just as the long korean winter was about to give way to the warmth of spring so he hoped that the relations between our two countries would soon move away from the coldness of winter and into the warmth of spring
6222955 in the years following the late president kims statement to my father many people in my own country doubted if it would ever happen but because of recent events we can truly say that a new springtime has arrived in the relationship between my country and the democratic peoples republic of korea

6222988 our nettlesome task is to discover how to organize our
6222989 we are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today we are confronted with the fierce urgency of now in this unfolding conundrum of life and history there is such a thing as being too late we still have a choice today nonviolent coexistence or violent co annihilation
6222990 non cooperation with evil is as much a duty as is cooperation with good
6222991 if you have more than you need you are stealing from someone else
6222992 this involves a disconnection from the resources being used from the needs of those in the future from ones fellow humans who are in need and disconnection from oneself and what happiness really means
6222993 it is no longer the choice between violence and nonviolence

6223012 oh no i feel so terrible that we were the cause of this young ladys untimely death the only way that we can offer repentance to her poor soul is to subject ourselves to a life free from the conveniences and articulation of modern man let us depart from this horrid scene which shall be branded into our sinful souls for all eternity

6223024 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god
6223025 your mission to the world is founded on the fact that i lived a god revealing life among you on the truth that you and all other men are the sons of god and it shall consist in the life which you will live among men the actual and living experience of loving men and serving them even as i have loved and served you

6223237 justice as an interpersonal relationship involving a claim and a responsibility a right and a duty applies to both god and man in its fundamental meaning mishpat refers to all actions which contribute to maintaining the covenant namely the true relation between man and man and between god and man
6223238 yhwh is portrayed as a creator god who orders and maintains a visible coherent fabric of life that produces well being in which that order is honoured
6223239 justice is not an ancient custom a human convention a value but a transcendent demand freighted with divine concern it is not only a relationship between man and man it is an act involving god a divine need it is not one of his ways but in all his ways its validity is not only universal but also eternal independent of will and experience
6223240 the prophet issues a series of requirements that are conditions for remaining in the land of promise
6223241 a just god demands justice among his covenant people 5 15 obedience rather than sacrifice 5 18 24
6223242 the text with its emphasis on justice mishpat and kindness hesed thus lies in two lines of tradition the cultic represented by psalms 15 and 24 and the prophetic in which righteousness is exalted above sacrifice

6223246 the conflicting responses to suffering in jeremiah generally fall under one of two categories the first maintains that the universe is orderly and congruent moral and stable and exacts punishment on wrongdoers the second raises questions regarding the character of god and the morality of the universe
6223247 the prophets do not speak of a divine relationship to an absolute principle or idea called justice they are intoxicated with the awareness of gods relationship to his people and to all men

6223250 the responsibilities and privileges of the king are summarised in jeremiah 22 15 16 focusing on his faithfulness to the covenant which entailed living justly and righteously and caring for the vulnerable members of the kingdom
6223251 the prophets were shocked not only by acts of injustice on the part of scoundrels but also by the perversion of justice on the part of the notables
6223252 a form of living a crossing point of god and man god is raging in the prophets words
6223253 he articulated what the community had to deny in order to continue the self deception of achievable satiation he affirmed that all the satiation was a quick eating of itself to death jeremiah knew long before the others that the end was coming and that god had had enough of indifferent affluence cynical oppression and presumptive religion
6223254 he just has to swallow hard and do what jfk did

6223277 we expected a bit more but this was a friendly game in the build up to the campaign
6223278 there are some plusses and some negatives to take from the game so we have to sit down and study the game
6223279 we went with a strong side and should have won the game with the team we had out there
6223280 it will take time its going to be a slow process
6223281 the crowd were frustrated of course we understand that but hopefully when it matters we can play
6223282 its been a problem for the last four or five years on the international stage we dont seem to click together
6223283 were trying to put our finger on it but we cant
6223284 it was a difficult night we were playing against a good team early on in the season and most boys played on sunday
6223285 it was a tough game tonight but we got a good draw against a good side but were still disappointed we didnt win it
6223286 wed liked to have played better tonight but well get stronger
6223287 im happy because we played a long time for an hour that i liked but the counter attack the czechs used was very dangerous
6223288 i learned that when the other team uses the counter attack we have some problems
6223289 we are at the start of the season and some of the players are not at the top physically

6223309 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6223310 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6223311 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist

6223324 family planning is really about deciding when it is right for you to have a child
6223325 its very unnerving for women to be told theyre having an abortion when theyre taking contraception
6223326 three hundred twenty five thousand americans is an extraordinary number of people to weigh in on a proposed regulation it shows that individual americans are concerned about womens health and that an important part of that is contraception clearly people are opposed to the new barriers for access to birth control
6223327 this shows that there is a ton of energy around this issue americans do not think that contraception is abortion mccain has been silent on this issue and he should explain to the american people if he thinks birth control is abortion
6223328 as a retired nurse who spent many years working with at risk families and children and as a mother of three children i am appalled at the notion that the president would even hint at further moves toward an abortion ban by including birth control pharmaceuticals in a rule change not needing congressional approval
6223329 i happen to be on birth control pills to treat an ovarian condition that is causing me to be infertile with hopes that i will ultimately be able to get pregnant so i find this attempt to redefine birth control incredibly offensive
6223330 as a mother of one completely planned and wanted child i feel strongly that the lifelong goal of parenting is not one that should be encouraged without ample forethought i do not consider birth control to be abortion i do consider intelligent and thoughtful family planning important to the future of the planet

6223341 its clear to us that the olympics have been a watershed moment for mobile media
6223342 the time sensitive nature of the olympics and the around the clock schedule of events have led many mobile consumers to view their phones as the place to stay connected
6223343 we argue that weve already hit a critical mass of audience and with the olympics that audience is only going to get bigger i think we will see impressive numbers for mobile consumption with the olympics
6223344 consumers are really just looking for that olympic snack on their phone
6223345 we know that people are using the phone to look at the tv schedule to look at the medal counts to look at highlights photos of the day and consumers are even looking at athlete info on their phones and are just reading up a little bit on the athletes and really surrounding themselves with contextual data from the olympics that get them pumped up for watching the events live in the evening
6223346 sip entertainment where you are just sipping little bit here and there
6223347 you want to check in and see how many medals your country is getting or see highlights of the latest michael phelps swim and i think that it makes sense
6223348 youre not going to watch it for three hours in your living room with your significant other with a bowl of popcorn
6223349 we shouldnt have to pay for it if we have to sit through commercials but if the commercials are taken out and its reasonable i think canadians are willing to pay for it if its not going to go over their cellphone data plan
6223350 maybe in the future when you buy a digital package you will pay a little more a month for mobile access

6223354 we are talking about people who were offered a mortgage a few months ago when the lenders were offering 95 per cent mortages but are unable to do so now that deposits of 15 per cent are required
6223355 in 1980 600 000 mortgages with homeowners were held by local authorities
6223356 since then the banking industry has almost universally taken on this role
6223357 the government should recognise that local authorities are well placed to judiciously take a share of mortgage business
6223358 it would be good news for customers if it got off the ground but it would not be done in a couple of months
6223359 with up to 5 billion in benefits still failing to reach some of the poorest pensioners the government must work much harder to get benefits cash to those who are entitled to it as soon as they become eligible
6223360 with these changes the government is giving with one hand and taking away with the other
6223361 i cannot see any justification for the change in the backdating rules other than to save money for the exchequer
6223362 consumers really could have done without this its not a serious supply issue right now because demand in august is low but it does raise the likelihood of problems this winter
6223363 gas available to export from norway to countries including the uk will be cut significantly and without adequate storage the uk will be left to negotiate with russia and the far east for supplies or risk running low on energy
6223364 the governments inability to make long term energy security decisions over the last decade is coming home to roost since the dash for gas in the 1990s the lack of political will to make tough decisions has left britain short of power our dependence on international supplies leaves the uk extremely vulnerable
6223365 good place to hide if you want an easy life
6223366 we have technical and procedural mechanisms that all postings go through more than 10 per cent of postings are not allowed
6223367 this is not a rant site we err on the side of caution and we do not allow libellous statements or company secrets to be revealed

6223369 there is an initial level of discomfort for chief executives but most see this as inevitable

6223371 there is a very strong feeling that improvements are needed in our airports and that is something we have to be realistic about but i dont see how the commissions findings will make much difference to passengers in the short term and may even delay improvements

6223373 a bunch of things have happened in our favour a great athlete the right time zone and interest in china and the event itself people are concerned about the economy and this is a nice relief people like thinking about something other than the credit crunch
6223374 but housing prices are still going down until they stabilise i dont think consumers are going to be the same engine of growth that they have been they just dont feel as rich businesses have to be ready for that
6223375 business is booming here and the job for ge is to go where its growing
6223376 most people see china only through beijing and shanghai but now all these other cities like xinjiang and chengdu are developing these are all chicagos or londons and their infrastructure needs are huge
6223377 clean energy and clean water is a big priority for the government
6223378 im never presumptuous about cultural changes in china or anywhere else but i think there is an awareness of the environment that has been growing inside china that i think the olympics amplify we see it in business in dialogue with steel customers or airlines we want to capitalise on that
6223379 being an olympic sponsor means we can show how we would replicate customer support and services across the country in other venues
6223380 the firms we cover lehman in particular continue to have significant exposures to the troubled asset classes with the exception of leveraged loans these exposures have proven difficult to remove or to hedge effectively as the market for these positions remains relatively illiquid as long as these firms have these troubled assets their earnings results will be affected by the fluctuations in the fixed income market
6223381 why would a business want to be based in london a city at the end of a branch line
6223382 i am for businesses and projects that are good for the country and against those that are bad

6223386 the biblical adage that we reap what we sow is very true in

6223422 its important now to find compounds that can be used in imaging because the earlier clinicians can detect the disease the better the chances are that a drug will halt disease progression while patients still have strong cognitive abilities
6223423 when we added these compounds to the reaction their interaction with the tau protein inhibited filaments from forming which could be valuable for therapeutics because it would prevent the formation of tau tangles some people think if we clear away the pathology seen in diseased brains that might alleviate symptoms of alzheimers disease
6223424 right there by police headquarters somebody had a lot of nerve to do that

6223474 the fact of the matter is his judgment which is clearly documented on the record about what to do in iraq was wrong and it was wrong when he said that we would have a fairly easy victory in iraq and linked to that he was wrong about afghanistan

6223636 theres always going to be a spore on the grassy knoll

6223648 we are confident that ivins was the only person responsible for the attacks
6223649 the sole custodian of rmr 1029 since it was first grown in 1997
6223650 an adequate explanation for his late laboratory work hours around the time of the attacks and sought to frame unnamed co workers
6223651 repeatedly named other researchers as possible mailers and claimed that the anthrax used in the attacks resembled that of another researcher
6223652 you can trace the anthrax to a lab but you cannot trace it to a person
6223653 totally responsive to every single question and never refused to answer
6223654 so concentrated and so consistent and so clean that i would assert that bruce could not have done that part
6223655 make something that no one else in the world can make with the kind of equipment that is available
6223656 we do not have that capability here nor do we have the scientists who know how to do that
6223657 ivins could not have produced anthrax of that type and potency at his army research lab without many other people being aware of it
6223658 we believe that the white house knew or had reason to know that an anthrax attack was imminent or underway
6223659 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a us government lab sent by a top us army scientist at fort detrick
6223660 from the beginning there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both islamic radicals and the 9 11 attacks
6223661 much more important than the general attempt to link the anthrax to islamic terrorists there was a specific intent indispensably aided by abc news to link the anthrax attacks to iraq
6223662 the same government lab where the anthrax attacks themselves came from was the same place where the false reports originated that blamed those attacks on iraq surely the question of who generated those false iraq anthrax reports is one of the most significant and explosive stories of the last decade

6223777 ive never done that if i am a follower of christ i should know what he says about prayer
6223778 prayer is not monologue but dialogue gods voice is its most essential part listening to gods voice is the secret of the assurance that he will listen to mine
6223779 it is only when we know that we are powerless that we are prepared to listen to jesus christ and to do what he says
6223780 a child is never shy before his mother and a child of god is conscious of his worthiness namely his entire dependence
6223781 dear god please give us a good day tomorrow so grandpa and i dont have to fish in the rain
6223782 we can be tired weary and emotionally distraught but after spending time alone with god we find that he injects into our bodies energy power and strength
6223783 learn to worship god as the god who does wonders who wishes to prove in you that he can do something supernatural and divine
6223784 the greatest thing anyone can do for god and man is pray it is not the only thing but it is the chief thing the great people of earth today are the people who pray i do not mean those who talk about prayer nor those who say they believe in prayer nor yet those who can explain about prayer but i mean those people who take time to pray
6223785 god will never tell us to do something that gratifies the flesh
6223786 pursuing prayer is prayer on a mission it is diligent fervent constant persevering determined and convinced
6223787 if bible christianity is to survive the present world upheaval we shall need to have a fresh revelation of the greatness and the beauty of jesus he alone can raise our cold hearts to rapture and restore again the art of true worship
6223788 the point to remember is that all our circumstances are in the hands of god the purpose of prayer is to reveal the presence of god equally present at all times and in every condition
6223789 it matters little what form of prayer we adopt or how many words we use what matters is the faith which lays hold on god knowing that he knows our needs before we even ask him that is what gives christian prayer its boundless confidence and its joyous certainty
6223790 prayer for jesus christ formed the brackets in which he accomplished his earthly work

6223792 i was wrong once it was when i thought i was wrong but i wasnt
6223793 god made christ who never sinned to be the offering for our sin so that we could be made right with god through christ
6223794 god has purchased our freedom with his blood and has forgiven all our sins
6223795 what does it mean if life can be snuffed out in an instant
6223796 so what the christian faith could just be a psychological trick

6223941 im a dancer and when i perform live i love to dance so i have to make sure it has that nice kicking bass the pop sound is to make it a little bit more now and when it comes to the rock it makes it very live feeling very instrumental i listen to a lot of music like classic rock alternative hip hop classical jazz whatever so im very musical and like to be able to incorporate that into my music as well

6223943 the people running the local governments have decided were not going to do it
6223944 these minimal standards for shelter laws are about as low on the totem pole as you can get these are just the minimum where we make sure that the government is not in effect torturing the animals it picks up

6223951 this facility like those used by other central banks has been designed in case the global credit markets deteriorate further and make cash difficult to access but the likelihood of this being needed remains extremely low
6223952 i can assure you we are well aware of the cost for people who have been unfortunately caught up in the fallout
6223953 but it is important to keep a sense of perspective
6223954 the majority of institutions accounting for over 90 per cent of household financial assets are not directly affected by these current events these institutions are well capitalised businesses and give no apparent reason for concern
6223955 our banks are navigating their way through the current turmoil well
6223956 this was shocking to all of us to the medical community
6223957 this was the first time in history that a baby was reported dying from breast milk
6223958 if that duplication of the gene may be five per cent which we believe it is for the canadian public in general this is 5 000 babies a year just in canada that may be exposed to that risk of mom being an ultra metabolizer
6223959 there was another severe poisoning that might have been fatal but mom also was very groggy so she stopped breastfeeding
6223960 so probably the baby was saved by not being breastfed
6223961 babies are much more sensitive to morphine than we thought in the past
6223962 we believe that should be a red flag from now on
6223963 so theres a lot of reason to rethink how we practise we need people to rethink it and especially if some babies may die from it thats totally unacceptable
6223964 it shouldnt provoke alarm among individual patients but it should provoke concern among professionals
6223965 however if the dose needed to treat your pain seems to be associated with drowsiness in your baby then you need to talk to somebody about that

6223973 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain
6223974 sen mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6223975 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6223976 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything

6223981 a veces preferir a estar muerto para que todo esto termine creo que lo mejor que pudo ocurrirle a los excomandantes es que los hayan extraditado porque a ellos no los va a juzgar la cpi pero a los que nos quedamos ac no sabemos qu va a pasar hicimos un mal arreglo esto es una trampa
6223982 estoy preocupado me siento acorralado y prefiero no extenderme en mis respuestas yo voy a seguir aclarando todo lo que tenga que decir pero la justicia debe reconocer que el estado no exist a se hab a ido nosotros ramos los que combat amos a la guerrilla pero los frentes se fueron retirando y en la zona quedaron milicianos

6223990 a person owing allegiance to a political party must refrain from making such defamatory and jingoistic statements it is highly irresponsible on naiks part to dub us beggars
6223991 though the ministers unwarranted remark has not lowered our respect for the state or its people it merits to be denounced and an apology from naik would be in place biharis are not beggars but have earned respect and status and done our state proud through sheer merit and hardwork
6223992 the government does not subscribe to singhs statement it might be his own opinion
6223993 as a constitutional safeguard we have favoured reservations from gram panchayat level to the parliament level and in education and employment for these tribes like it is available for scs and sts
6223994 since most of the people falling under these tribes have no addresses they can never get access to voter cards and ration cards a housing scheme is a must to give hundreds of these people addresses
6223995 the government should be facilitating the settlement of such tribes as villages by acquiring land for the purpose
6223996 this facility like those used by other central banks has been designed in case the global credit markets deteriorate further and make cash difficult to access but the likelihood of this being needed remains extremely low

6224082 i always look forward to getting back here with my football family
6224083 i have been looking forward to this day since dec 1
6224084 the main thing we wanted to do today was to get to know the 50 or 60 freshmen that are out there for the first time
6224085 we just try to get to know each of them and really emphasize family
6224086 the older kids remember going through their first day of practice as freshmen and they did a good job of taking the younger players under their wings
6224087 they were similar in that we had the maxing out sessions and we had team meetings
6224088 but if there was a difference this practice might have been a little less grueling and we worked more on the mental side of the game that is a good thing because when you are trying to get 130 players 50 of those you have never seen before on the same page you have to retain a lot of information so it went well
6224089 we had some mental errors but when you are running a new system things are not going to be as perfect as you would like them to be for the first game but i was super happy with the energy and effort
6224090 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6224091 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this
6224092 until the fannie and freddie issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere
6224093 i think students are going to be irresponsible either way if its age eighteen or twenty one

6224095 i mean there are younger kids drinking at younger ages
6224096 just because they cant buy it doesnt mean someone else isnt going to buy it for them
6224097 i think its time we look at making a change

6224099 only the tail was recognisable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6224100 i saw how the plane broke in two and a huge explosion
6224101 also you feel powerless because the airline doesnt provide any information at all
6224102 this morning it did re kindle up in the attic space so weve been here for about an hour and a half putting out hot spots
6224103 only the tail was recognizable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6224104 i saw how the plane broke in two and a huge explosion
6224105 also you feel powerless because the airline doesnt provide any information at all
6224106 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6224107 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6224108 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6224109 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6224110 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6224111 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6224112 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6224113 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6224114 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6224115 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6224116 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6224117 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6224118 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6224119 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6224120 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6224121 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6224122 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6224123 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6224124 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6224125 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6224126 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6224127 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6224128 my boyfriend really wanted to see this comedian at a comedy club on his last night in town but i forgot to reserve our seats and we got turned away
6224129 exactly what the hell are those people going on about all the time
6224130 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6224131 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this
6224132 until the fannie and freddie issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere
6224133 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6224134 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this
6224135 until the fannie and freddie issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere
6224136 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6224137 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6224138 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6224139 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6224140 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6224141 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6224142 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6224143 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6224144 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6224145 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6224146 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6224147 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6224148 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6224149 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6224150 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6224151 i am happy with the draw because the reaction of the team in the last minute was good that is important capello said
6224152 in the first half we played good football with good style and created a lot of chances to score the team played together
6224153 the only thing i didnt like in the first half was when the czechs counter attacked we suffered a lot
6224154 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6224155 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this
6224156 until the fannie and freddie issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere
6224157 u s efforts to change the strategic balance of power in its favor
6224158 lawton man to go on trial for 2007 double murder
6224159 a year ago my daughter was murdered and ive got to continue the fight for justice for her
6224160 he gave no there was no emotion for killing anyone
6224161 im a little relieved now that theyve bound him over to the next step
6224162 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6224163 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6224164 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6224165 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6224166 the main thing were doing is the paint is all recycled paint
6224167 wherever were replacing carpet theyre taking the old carpet out and thats being recycled
6224168 were just very mindful and conscious of what we can do to save all that waste
6224169 the problem in the past for staff or for members even if you were here for an hour or eight hours the fumes were really causing trouble
6224170 people were having headaches and feeling lightheaded it just wasnt a good situation
6224171 we use whey which is a byproduct of cheese to replace many of the toxic binders typically found which create the off gassing
6224172 our product has very little off gassing and a neutral smell so when youre indoors putting it down theres not that noxious fume
6224173 for example with this project with the paint weve been able to paint the entire facility for what it would have cost for just one floor last year
6224174 i really feel we can be ambassadors for what can be done right here in burlington
6224175 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6224176 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6224177 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6224178 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6224179 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6224180 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6224181 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6224182 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6224183 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6224184 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6224185 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6224186 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6224187 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6224188 one always overcompensates for disabilities im thinking of having my entire body surgically removed
6224189 mrs gordon this is dr es office do you want to pick up the form for your handicap placard or do you want it mailed
6224190 what would you do if you only had 37 days left to live do my a favor go and read her magnificent journal and leave her your thoughts about what the last 37 days of your life would be like if you knew you only had 37 days left
6224191 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6224192 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6224193 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6224194 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6224195 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6224196 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6224197 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6224198 who are open to doing something on the production side
6224199 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6224200 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6224201 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6224202 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6224203 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6224204 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6224205 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6224206 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6224207 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6224208 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6224209 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6224210 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6224211 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6224212 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6224213 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6224214 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6224215 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6224216 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6224217 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6224218 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6224219 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6224220 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6224221 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6224222 when i use a word it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less

6224227 on the day i was all set to go pose outdoors for the magazine it rained like crazy
6224228 i wanted to wait till another day but my boyfriend was all jazzed up to do it and he got real disappointed then i had the idea of posing in my bathroom and putting on the skin cream i remembered one time before he had walked in while i was doing it and he got all sexed up for some reason he got all excited when i suggested it so i figured it must be something that guys like to see so i stripped and rubbed the cream all over me and he about orgasmed i dont have a favorite way to have sex yet i like doing it in all sorts of ways and in all sorts of places
6224229 bring together some of the best and brightest minds from two leading institutions who are working together to advance medical imaging and bioengineering
6224230 that interception we got last year happened to get us to where we wanted to be the super bowl whether he came back or didnt it didnt make much difference
6224231 we are going to go out there the same way and do what we do on defense keep them from scoring and eliminate the big plays
6224232 i know he has a big gun and tries to make big plays and we are going to try to put pressure on the quarterback and try to eliminate big plays
6224233 i just happened to read the route downfield and was able to undercut it and make them turn the ball over
6224234 i didnt know what he was doing at that time
6224235 im trying to watch the receiver i was able to get my head back around and played the ball in the air secured it and went down and helped us get to the super bowl
6224236 i never changed last year from the beginning of the season
6224237 i am still working hard doing the things that i normally do i go out and try to get better
6224238 hopefully i get to play a long time and make a lot more interceptions
6224239 hopefully i can forget about that one and make some bigger ones thats my goal
6224240 we know vermont is one of the safest states in the country and in my 25 years experience there have been periods of time spikes of crimes and were in one of those spikes right now and were dealing with it the best way we can
6224241 there were difficult moments but the players were able to dig deep as they did at the end of the match
6224242 that was a positive we scored three goals but conceded two
6224243 this was a more open team a new team a new generation with a new way of playing
6224244 but between winning 3 2 and 1 0 i would choose 3 2
6224245 i think we are ready for the world cup qualifiers
6224246 i think we did well in the first half and put petr cech under a lot of pressure he was their best player and made three good saves
6224247 the czechs are a very good team which is why i wanted to play them they are not easy to beat
6224248 but we created chances especially in the first half and played well but we suffered when they counter attacked and this is a problem we must work on
6224249 i can see progression i think we are moving forward
6224250 we started the match with the idea of surviving which we managed we were attacking well from the breaks
6224251 maybe if we had started the second half 1 0 up it would have been better for us but although it shook us marek jankulovsvky scored a beautiful goal from his free kick
6224252 we controlled the game for most of the second half and they did not have too many scoring chances but england are a very strong team who played right to the end and it was a shame we conceded such a late goal
6224253 we were very lucky this guy was stopped and nobody was killed yesterday
6224254 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6224255 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6224256 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6224257 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6224258 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6224259 as long as i assume that the world is something i discover by turning my punny son
6224260 i was writing an administrative outline for a forum and referred to it as an adminifesto someone wrote back that he was a fan of portmanteaus so i asked him if that made him a portfanteau i dont know if he appreciated that
6224261 when you look at fuel oil being 4 50 a gallon it cuts our heating costs by well over half
6224262 this costs a little bit less than a new oil furnace and its more efficient and it doesnt produce as much greenhouse gas emissions
6224263 i didnt come here to start a pellet mill or a stove manufacturing facility i got hit with my first heating bill and i started searching for solutions
6224264 we have an exact number 568 just out of the manufacturing aspect wed like to do that in the next 3 4 years
6224265 everyone has hope now that vermont wood energy is for real and we are going to do what we say we are going to do which is provide one pellets at an inexpensive costs two stoves and three jobs so all thats happening
6224266 they have to now earn it so its not an up front incentive its something they have to earn and then they receive cash from the state
6224267 do you feel a lot of responsibility to make this happen and make this work
6224268 yeah there is it seems now that the faces that were skeptical are now hopeful and you dont want to let them down
6224269 boy you know we should change these things so that theyre more understandable by a consumer and we should talk to the search providers and see what they think see if a firefox start page is of interest to them and see whether theres any revenue to be had in this setting
6224270 it was beautiful to be back a bit less to be 2 0 down
6224271 there was a little lack of attention in part because while they might not be a great team they have great physical and athletic qualities and they showed them
6224272 then we started to speed things up especially in the second half we fixed the result which is always important
6224273 we went after the win until the end passing the ball around quickly
6224274 it wasnt easy against such a physical side they were very tall they only conceded us the flanks
6224275 we wanted to win but it wasnt to be it was a good work out and i was able to blood a number of players and they all did well which was great
6224276 overall i think we passed it quite well at times northern ireland as we knew were going to make it difficult for us i think we were lacking a little cutting edge which could have won us the game
6224277 i think the tackle in the first half was enthusiasm from a youngster and the second one was innocuous really
6224278 sporting 6 heat pipes and the award winning psycho acoustically optimized nf p12 120mm fan the nh c12p achieves excellent performance and outstanding quietness the down facing c type design doesnt only allow for optimal motherboard and case compatibility but also provides additional cooling for motherboard components through two airflow gaps outfitted with the professional secufirm mounting system and noctuas much acclaimed nt h1 thermal compound the nh c12p is a premium class silent cooler through and through
6224279 if a good rain doesnt come soon corn yield will go down and some of bean pods will fail to produce any beans so the situation bears watching
6224280 after more than a month of use extensively testing the ts 409 we were left very favorably impressed especially with the seemingly endless array of features and available configurations the ts 409 pro offered good performance data protection and differentiated themselves from their competition
6224281 the added value comes from the extra disks and raid levels supported and when i say raid im not talking about a simple onboard controller the qnap ts 409 pro surprised me with raid 6 although slightly pointless with only 4 disks and features like online expansion and migration such functionality is usually only found on advanced controllers youd find in high end servers

6224285 utah as we know is a program that is to be respected and not overlooked by michigan and with what michigan experienced last year and what they went through losing to appalachian state that alone is going to have them excited they have a new head coach in his first game and in the big house utah will not slip in off the radar they have michigans full attention its going to be a challenge for brian johnson and utah dealing with that defense until michigan gathers themselves on offense with so many new people they have to win games with the defense
6224286 i usually dont get off when men are pounding hard on my breasts or squeezing or pinching them really hard just do it kindly and nicely to my nipples massage them im kind of sensitive underneath my boobs as well so just moving your hands back and forth under my boobs feels really good lick them but dont bite them and one of the other things is i have a hard time getting off when im on top unless the guy holds my breasts i like to grind when im riding a guys cock i like to move back and forth but the only way i can get off is if he has at least one hand on my boobs its always been like that for me unless im on the bottom in which case i can cum any way i want but when im on top i need to have that kind of sensitivity and stimulation but if he squeezes too hard i lose interest if a guy is nice to me while im riding him then i definitely cum
6224287 diversity of power sources is a real important concept just as diversity in your investments

6224289 just when we thought we would no longer receive any more 9600 gts because we figured wed reviewed just about every single one on the market asus has decided to run around and release a new one the particular card were looking at today is part of the republic of gamers collection which is something we tend to see more in the motherboard department it makes a lot of sense though that asus are going to expand this popular naming scheme out to more than just motherboards this new card comes to us as the en9600gt matrix matrix is also something we havent heard of from asus before so it will be interesting to see if theyre going to start creating some new lines

6224310 we have an educational system in illinois that discriminates against minority children and those who should be held responsible for overseeing it are doing nothing and very little about it
6224311 we should all be on the same side when the issue is properly funding the education of 2 million children throughout our state
6224312 experience is the best and simplest way to learn anything that is why it is so valued in the business world
6224313 it defines the corporations character and culture formal and informal networks all the elements that compose the dynamics of an organisation
6224314 in china for example etiquette and attitudes are very different so a successful strategy in europe might fail in china changemasters can reflect these cultural differences
6224315 some people have enormous influence in a corporation or department through their reputation or their informal networks of co workers
6224316 and we recommend that it is run as a seminar with a large number of staff forming teams to run through the change scenario but some companies like ikea run the game in small workshops

6224434 expert surgeons tend to focus on the operative field they look at a certain area
6224435 their pupils get quiet and dont oscillate as much and they dont blink as much whereas a novice is not quite sure where theyre looking they look all over the operative field they tend to blink more and the pupils tend to dilate or shrink a lot more rapidly
6224436 you cant claim to be an expert if youre blinking too much or your eye movement is too fast

6224521 qui n puede reivindicar un derecho a recibir el cuerpo de cristo todo es un acto sin medida del amor de dios nuestro se or se hace l mismo disponible en su cuerpo y en su sangre pero no podemos decir jam s que tenemos el derecho de recibirlo en la santa comuni n cada vez que nos acercamos a l debemos hacerlo con una profunda conciencia de nuestra indignidad
6224522 recibir indignamente el cuerpo y la sangre de cristo es un sacrilegio si lo hace deliberadamente en pecado mortal es un sacrilegio
6224523 si tenemos un pecado mortal en la conciencia debemos primero confesarnos de ese pecado y recibir la absoluci n y s lo despu s acercarnos al sacramento eucar stico
6224524 funcionario p blico que con conocimiento y consentimiento sostiene acciones que est n contra la ley moral divina y eterna por ejemplo si apoya p blicamente el aborto procurado que comporta la supresi n de vidas humanas inocentes e indefensas una persona que comete pecado de esta manera debe ser amonestada p blicamente de modo que no reciba la comuni n hasta que no haya reformado la propia vida
6224525 si una persona que ha sido amonestada persiste en un pecado mortal p blico y se acerca a recibir la comuni n el ministro de la eucarist a tiene la obligaci n de neg rsela por qu sobre todo por la salvaci n de la persona misma impidi ndole realizar un sacrilegio
6224526 en primer lugar un esc ndalo referente a nuestra disposici n para recibir la santa comuni n
6224527 se debe evitar que la gente sea inducida a pensar que se puede estar en estado de pecado mortal y acercarse a la eucarist a en segundo lugar podr a existir otra forma de esc ndalo consistente en llevar a la gente a pensar que el acto p blico que esta persona est haciendo que hasta ahora todos cre an que era un pecado serio no lo es tanto si la iglesia le permite recibir la comuni n
6224528 si tenemos una figura p blica que abierta y deliberadamente sostiene los derechos abortistas y que recibe la eucarist a qu terminar pensando la gente com n puede llegar a creer que es correcto hasta cierto punto suprimir una vida inocente en el seno materno
6224529 no tiene ninguna intenci n de interferir en la vida p blica sino en el estado espiritual del pol tico o del funcionario p blico que si es cat lico debe seguir la ley divina tambi n en la esfera p blica
6224530 por tanto es simplemente rid culo y equivocado tratar de silenciar a un pastor acus ndolo de interferir en pol tica para que no pueda hacer el bien al alma de un miembro de su grey

6224587 michael has confirmed that he is not suffering with a terminal illness and is seeking professional help in adelaide with the support of his family we are asking our church to pray for the guglielmucci family during this difficult time
6224588 the national executive is taking this matter very seriously and is awaiting the results of medical tests before determining the full extent of the discipline that will be imposed upon him

6224594 this study is encouraging because the fmri technique allowed us to see and compare the activity levels in specific regions of the brain before and during vision restoration therapy after examining the images the increased activity levels demonstrate progress associated with the treatment

6224602 but what is most striking about the report is what it doesnt say almost no mention is made of the big risk that unless we effectively tackle obesity the number of people suffering with diabetes will almost certainly increase
6224603 a diabetes strategy will not be worth the paper its written on if a greater focus is not put on obesity
6224604 todays report shows that the nhs is getting better and better at identifying people with diabetes and at supporting them to manage their condition
6224605 the next stage review made prevention a priority for the nhs and this is especially relevant to diabetes as a disease whose global increase in prevalence is partly a consequence of rising obesity
6224606 our vascular risk assessment programme putting prevention first is expected to prevent thousands of people developing diabetes each year and our strategy to tackle the rise in obesity will help many more reduce their risk of the disease

6224665 patches that can be freely downloaded on the internet are not insignificant they are far better than not putting anything on your network but if india goes for signing in root files with a particular digital signature then they cant be hijacked

6224671 hope is a road in the country there was never a road but when many people walk on it the road comes into existence
6224672 hope is faith holding out its hand in the dark
6224673 hope has two beautiful daughters their names are anger and courage anger at the way things are and courage to see that they do not remain the way they are
6224674 i still believe in hope mostly because theres no such place as fingers crossed arkansas

6224692 probably every colonial spanish shipwreck that has ever been discovered has had coins that originated in peru
6224693 so it will be interesting to see how successful they are in getting other governments and shipwreck explorers to recognize their interest
6224694 theres a surprising dearth of law on high seas salvage
6224695 while weve of course taken the right amount of inspiration from the hotd series and fans will notice where we have referenced the other games were not sharing assets or technology as a game story and visual experience its entirely brand new
6224696 i think what happened yesterday represents a struggle between sunni and shiite politicians and some are trying to settle old scores
6224697 it seems to me that some leaders of the security forces are trying to ignite sectarian strife again
6224698 we anticipate the review will propose a range of options including a break up of baas monopoly

6224700 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6224701 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6224702 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6224703 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6224704 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much

6224709 the end result is going to be a better product for the consumer
6224710 we get a lot of questions about how to program it
6224711 why did no one run over to help him in an emergency maybe his life could have been saved
6224712 peoples lives are being lost but sometimes i wonder if anyone cares if another mexican immigrant dies
6224713 you see people crouching underneath tractors when you go out in the fields we think workers should be able to rest with dignity
6224714 if somebody doesnt have shade up and available for workers this summer theyre going to get a whooping
6224715 collections has been a problem historically and we need to fix it i cant sugar coat it
6224716 people have been dying all along every year for decades and now that were finally focusing on it were finding all these heat fatalities were doing all we can with the very limited resources we have
6224717 unscrupulous employers can game the system by filing frivolous appeals
6224718 we cannot expect our workers to endure a lengthy series of appeals especially when people have actually died from these conditions
6224719 is the purpose of cal osha to induce compliance and protect workers or is the purpose to collect fine money from employers
6224720 encouraging employers to settle gets the hazards abated more quickly and gets employees protected more quickly
6224721 i completely understand that cal osha is overworked and understaffed but whats offensive is that the agency is reducing fines with no justification
6224722 in some cases companies are paying pennies on the dollar from the original fine imposed
6224723 im sitting here at shutters listening to the new ac dc album on steve barnetts macbook air
6224724 losing the game to argentina in this way is really shameful
6224725 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometer of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction
6224726 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometer of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction
6224727 i was deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life in todays aircraft crash at barajas airport in madrid the news of which has shocked us all
6224728 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6224729 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6224730 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6224731 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6224732 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6224733 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6224734 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6224735 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6224736 but it is more important to have friends who share your values and your aspirations and your dreams and poland and the united states are those kind of friends
6224737 hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6224738 he said it wouldnt work he announced his policy toward iraq the day before he left for the first time in over 900 days to visit iraq and then he refuses to acknowledge the surge has succeeded remarkable remarkable
6224739 no rational observer can go to iraq and see what we are doing for the last years and say the surge hasnt succeeded
6224740 are you going to pick a vice president that conservatives can rally around in the future or are you going to give us someone that is going to make us want to stay home
6224741 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities
6224742 you can die for your country but you can have a beer
6224743 under most scenarios extending the catch up to 26 wasnt cost effective
6224744 with so many essential questions still unanswered there is good reason to be cautious about introducing large scale vaccination programs
6224745 in the current environment it is hard to find any specific triggers for these moves
6224746 i think were seeing consolidation but personally i think that theres scope for a rebound in the aussie dollar
6224747 the us dollar is consolidating after what we saw in the last couple of weeks which were fairly dramatic moves
6224748 we think this pullback is going to happen eventually in the short term however the overall sentiment remains us dollar positive

6224761 i use that term in a scientific or engineering sense is a big black box
6224762 hey lets measure the realized value of this initiative and see how it matches the business case
6224763 what would you like to come out of the box if you had your wishes
6224764 by how much by when and how will you measure it
6224765 by 25 by the end of next year and wed measure it by looking at the increase in sales volume per quarter per salesperson
6224766 ok fred now let me explain the black box is not really a black box its a system with people processes policies information and so on what will the black box system need to do to increase sales productivity by 25
6224767 it will need to save the sales people time increase their efficiency so more of their time is spent on selling rather than looking for information and other activities that get in the way and it will need to improve their close ratio make them more effective at selling
6224768 ok fred lets talk about exactly how the black box might achieve those goals lets drill down on how it might improve the sales close ratio to better understand the best possible ways we might be able to do this and how we will measure and track the ability for the system to improve the close ratio
6224769 when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers you know something about it but when you cannot measure it when you cannot express it in numbers your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind

6224841 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6224842 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much

6224863 someone in my office loud of voice and dim of wit asked rhetorically on friday last what russian wanted by its invasion of georgia like most of the morons working here they never read the reports that abound so i took the trouble to tell them what the russians want they want primarily to destroy georgia as a military force albeit a force that had been entirely controlled and armed by the united states they want to locate and destroy the huge stocks of weaponry to include small arms light infantry weapons armored vehicles and trucks supplied to georgia by the united states they have done this in short they want to so destroy georgia as a military power that it will take ten years to even think about rebuilding they want to establish a powerful military presence in south ossetia and abkhazia so that a us and isreal backed georgia will never dare to attack across their borders again another goal of russia it is said is to so ruin the international and internal reputation of the unstable georgian president mikheil saakashvili that the georgian people will either depose or kill him and most of all the redoubtable vladimir putin who is indeed running the show wants to show bush and all the weak but willing east bloc peoples what can happen to them when they lick the anus of a helpless washington nato a force to reckon with not likely the belgian army is better equipped than the american one and neither of them could make a dent on russia in a land war the once mighty and tererrible american military is today a soggy mess its ground troops basicially ruined by the five year marathon guerrilla combat in iraq and afhanistan and their vaunted armored vehicles and helicopters all in maintainence warehouses in texas destroyed by the desert sands of iraq if russia were to attack poland or the ukraine tonight all bush could do would be to run into his white house bunker and soil his pants whille cheney hid in his own command bunker and shouted threats into the chemical toilet parenthetically in england one of rupert murdochs sleazy tabloids said that putin threatened to nuke poland of course putin never said this and anyone who would believe something written in a murdoch paper or presented on his rabidly right wing fox news should have a lobotomy nato trust it not sir it shall prove a snare and a delusion as patrick henry said in his brilliant speech to the virginia houe of burgesses the balance of the world has shifted in six days moved by hubris the stupidity of washington and tel aviv and the manic president of georgia i told all of this to my airheaded fellow worker and when i was done they said i was crazy tell people that a huge hurricaine is bearinig down on some part of florida or the gulf coast where they are living and this type immediately sets out to have a picnic on the beach god save us all because bush surely cannot
6224864 we are now in a fight against the great russia
6224865 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
6224866 georgian prime minister vladimer lado gurgenidze jewish made a special call to israel tuesday morning to receive a blessing from one of the haredi communitys most important rabbis and spiritual leaders rabbi aharon leib steinman
6224867 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
6224868 the btc pipeline considerably changes the status of the regions countries and cements a new pro west alliance
6224869 i saw a georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children
6224870 to be part of resolving the problem and not contributing to it
6224871 these bases have only recently been upgraded to nato standard
6224872 they have been operationally targeted to seriously degrade the georgian military
6224873 there is a presence of our armed forces near gori and senaki we make no secret of it
6224874 they are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of gori and senaki without any guard whatsoever
6224875 there are a few countries that will say told you so
6224876 but many more will want to walk away from the problem and for the next few years georgia will be far too busy trying to pick itself up
6224877 what is a unipolar world it refers to one type of situation one centre of authority one centre of force one centre of decision making it is world in which there is one master one sovereign this is pernicious unacceptable impossible
6224878 the war in georgia has put the european order in question
6224879 we shouldnt make any moral judgments on this war stopping the war thats what were interested in
6224880 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister putin is interested in reasserting russias not only russias great power or superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
6224881 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
6224882 an invasion of ukraine by peacekeeping tanks is just a question of time
6224883 weimar russia is completing its transformation into something else if russia wins this war a new order will take shape in europe which will have no place for ukraine as a sovereign state
6224884 there is a lack of a clear and unified european policy towards russia
6224885 the russian strategy of keeping control of exports and supply is outpacing any european response
6224886 in politics it is very important to know ones measure
6224887 if russia continues to inflict strikes on georgian territory on facilities on population centres we may lose the moral supremacy we have today
6224888 this may not be a culmination but only step one
6224889 if you dont stop this kind of behaviour it escalates

6224934 i feel good at the plate it wasnt easy missing games but im ready to go now im glad to be back i want to be there for the team
6224935 last term the school hosted a big kids little kids night which was for fathers and children to come along and solve some science questions together
6224936 having fathers grandfathers uncles and older brothers is extremely important for childrens social and emotional development
6224937 i think they like me being in the canteen and it shows them that father figures play a role just as much as the women here do
6224938 i love volunteering at the canteen on wednesdays and fridays because i get to spend a bit of time with bumpy but also get to know his mates and keep up with his life
6224939 children love having a father figure around in the canteen
6224940 he visits his pop every second weekend to go fishing and help him with renovations he gets to hold the hammer every now and then
6224941 people were talking about tunnels and putting railway lines here and railway lines there
6224942 there was talk of bringing the link road down to single carriageway to save money and doing it in piecemeal fashion
6224943 but the link road is the only option i dont care if it is single or dual carriageway but the rta has told me that if it is intended to be dual carriageway in the future they should do it now to save a lot of money
6224944 the brief for discussion was transport solutions not just f3 solutions
6224945 we discussed urban growth areas the difficulty people here have in getting to newcastle university the fact we have no real link to the airport and the problems for employees in the mining sector
6224946 we need a free flowing efficient traffic route the urban growth we have is all along the new england highway and there needs to be an alternative so the only people coming in to maitland are the people who need to
6224947 tafe campuses colleges and universities are what we should be looking to build
6224948 we should have a university campus and we need to be pro active to get them
6224949 they said it the grammar school couldnt be done but these days its got almost 1000 kids
6224950 local business people stepped up and put money on the ground and made it happen
6224951 having it there is part of the richness we maitland have to offer
6224952 background research needs to be done so that weve got a really case to put forward with the reasons and the benefits for maitland as a community
6224953 i suppose a university campus at maitland would be positive for the whole community
6224954 i think maitland is coming to the age that it certainly wouldnt be unfeasible for a campus to be here
6224955 first aid skills are important for any frontline emergency service workers
6224956 so we make sure they are trained to an advanced level which means they can provide emergency on the spot care and manage injuries until an ambulance arrives
6224957 not only does this improve safety for our firefighters it means that our community can rest assured that firefighters have the training they need to provide appropriate care in an emergency
6224958 put all these rumours to rest once and for all
6224959 its not dangerous and its not particularly noisy either its only a little bit above background noise
6224960 part of what we had to do is get concerns from people and work out ways to address those concerns
6224961 were already looking at ways we could drop noise levels even further
6224962 they are concerns that people raise but theyre not really risks
6224963 its not a risk here and we need to work with the community to make sure they understand that the more information we can get them the more comfortable they will be
6224964 what we want to do is talk to the community and work out things to do that they think are appropriate
6224965 we have been retaining profits locally and investing in india we have also moved capital to india where necessary
6224966 hdfc is an outstanding institution and we have no plan whatsoever to divest our stake it has been a great investment for our shareholders
6224967 those prospects fit our product and franchise capability we have faith in indias growth
6224968 its a good time for indian companies who want to acquire u s business process outsourcing groups as valuations have corrected significantly
6224969 we recognize that more and more people are turning to new media and as a result new media has become a powerful driving force
6224970 were providing access to resources and platforms to discuss politics and sustainability we made it a non partisan event and bloggers that have access to our tent represent this for example we have people from daily kos and we also have bloggers from the heritage foundation completely different sides of the spectrum
6224971 first were trying to develop partnerships and momentum to lure convention participants over to our tent being half a block outside the security line we think itll be simpler than maybe otherwise the other incentive is that we simply provide a gathering place with access to resources including food and wifi these are the kinds of resources that the new media hasnt experienced at any other major national event
6224972 theres a small part of the space sponsored by google that is accessible by people
6224973 but the majority of the tent will be for credentialed bloggers only the second floor of the tent will be the media lounge and nobody but the credentialed people will be allowed up there the ground floor will have a bit more multi use so it will have a little more accessibility but nonetheless there will only be a limited number of spots for those who dont have reservations
6224974 basically i just wanted to be there at this historic event
6224975 i wanted to be part of it both as a podcaster and also to shoot video ive got the gear i know how to use it and im pretty good at interviewing i thought why not just place myself in the middle of it and see what stories develop
6224976 i think the more voices that are in the conversation the richer the dialog is going to be
6224977 the big thing with bloggers is there is no gatekeeper youre not hearing the message of the day youre hearing it as it happens depending on the level of expertise and the talent its like having an eyewitness for you what i love about the big tent is that they were so open to diversity
6224978 i really want to focus on some of our local or state stories
6224979 for instance not only is nevada a swing state my county is considered the swing county in the state also we have the possibility of electing our first all female congressional delegation which is really exciting
6224980 im sure theres going to be plenty of opportunities to focus on the west since its in colorado
6224981 democratic candidates from new mexico are going to be over there and im going to try to talk to them actually something weve been doing on our blog a lot lately is podcasts through blog talk radio its basically just an online radio show that people can listen to live and can call into
6224982 any learned critical thinking reasoned human being would realize that this is a charade to sugar up and pacify the progressive community
6224983 its going to be a different group of people that are there there wont be as much bumping into the congressmen in the hallway itll be more of networking with other bloggers that does have a lot of value too its just going to be different i think
6224984 do you think itll be less value at all because the bloggers are not going to be on the ground in the convention
6224985 i think that having worked for a number of candidates and elected officials i think they have their own sort of agendas and mostly theyll want to network with each other while theyre there
6224986 but i would not be surprised if some of them reserved some time to come talk to the media i just dont honestly believe that everyone is going to come out to the big tent i dont think they will also a lot of people dont understand the power of the blogosphere so they may or may not be that tapped into it quite yet
6224987 they have been very good about explaining their whole process of applying
6224988 and theyve been very good about getting back to us like we had one person in our group who applied under a different blog name and due to a family emergency she wont be able to be there we wanted to see if we could still use the pass for the group and theyre working with us to figure out a way to do that theyve been very responsive and very helpful i think

6224993 it was really important to all levels of government here to really set the tone for the work well do behind the scenes over the next couple of months and give our officials directions
6224994 there is a fairly high burnout rate in first nations
6224995 a lot of them actually go to work for the territorial government or federal government and burnout is part of it
6224996 that is why the mandate is such a key here
6224997 i think when you talk about the relationship that we are able to build and develop upon it is a relationship that is going to be beneficial to all yukon not just to first nation people but to all yukoners
6224998 i am pleased with the fact there is back up plan in place
6224999 i dont feel it will be finished by march it is slow going at times
6225000 its mostly the wheels of government and how they work but our officials are ready to get the work done
6225001 we have never done this before and this has not been done in the past
6225002 youd assume the controversy is part of the price so there must be some other reason lilly wants this asset

6225012 in december i dont think there was anybody in this state that didnt have a smile on their face with us going to the sugar bowl and then by january 5 or 10 everybody was moping around but its ended up positive
6225013 i liken the athletic program to the front porch to a house
6225014 its something that can invite people in and if its really well kept and if its a nice place you can have parties and barbeques
6225015 were not the most important thing to the university by a long stretch but we are the vehicle of visibility in so many ways
6225016 up there you know theyre curing cancer and theyre doing things with engineering astrophysics and volcanology
6225017 any team receiving apr penalties this year needs to improve academically and bring its apr above the 925 benchmark
6225018 penalties only get worse if a team consistently falls below 925 but the goal is improvement not punishment
6225019 hardly any ncaa student athletes earn a paycheck as a professional athlete
6225020 just 1 8 percent of ncaa football student athletes go on to play professionally but graduating with a degree is important even for those who go pro because they wont compete as a professional athlete the rest of their working lives
6225021 you always do your work first thats what my parents taught me
6225022 take care of business because you never know football may not always be there for you
6225023 the apr has changed how schools recruit students approach academics and manage academic programs
6225024 more coaches athletic directors university presidents and chancellors are realizing the importance of maintaining a good apr and are relaying that importance to their student athletes
6225025 we dont have the money that the bcs schools have to solve their problems you know hire class checkers and that type of thing they have the same problems that we do but they can cover it up they throw money at it one school spent 150 000 toward just class checking which we cant do arizona has 54 class checkers we dont have that kind of money so weve got to be more creative
6225026 not that there was a complete lack of accountability before but we feel like we are a special faculty and this way just brings a different sensibility
6225027 now theres no question of priorities we totally support our student athletes on the field but our first goal is to get them graduated
6225028 our number one goal is to graduate 100 percent of the players
6225029 everybody has to work together and we all have to support one another and know that were serious from top to bottom education is number one its that important
6225030 i think that the players are realizing now that coach mack is very serious when he tells them that they need to get their degrees and they need to be responsible for the decisions that they make
6225031 he wasnt even officially the coach yet and he was pushing us guys to get into summer school
6225032 in years before only like 20 guys would go to summer school this year it was something like 80
6225033 you ask what are we going to do about the apr you give them more education you get more tutors you give them more school
6225034 i know were above a 3 0 gpa as a football team from over the summer and i am really proud of that because in some places guys just take advantage of it and jerk around but these guys for them to go to school and be humble about it you know weve got great guys
6225035 coach macks push for summer school included bringing in our new players before they ever even started here
6225036 so the freshmen got a head start they get familiar with the campus and they completed six credits so if you think about it over the course of four years thats 24 credits thats an entire academic year
6225037 we now have a goal with our players that they graduate the december of their senior year
6225038 in the spring we know that this happens historically they want to go off and take their shot in the nfl so we want to make sure theyve graduated first its fairly ambitious but we have the commitment of a dedicated coaching staff
6225039 all i can say is coach mcmackin is an educator first
6225040 ive seen some coaches whove come in with the philosophy of win at all cost they really dont care if a kid comes in and stays eligible for a couple of years then goes and does whatever plays for the nfl or just gets an hourly paying job they do not care as long as that player can help them win but with coach mack if a kid isnt getting his academics done he isnt going to play it doesnt matter if youre a starter or if youre third string if you dont get the job done in school then youre gonna have to sit it out
6225041 he is so supportive of what we do its been a hopeful time for us
6225042 inbev has asked us to fire the directors as a shareholder and investor id like to
6225043 i said it before and ill say it again inbev can bite me
6225044 of course he wants to decrease production numnuts switched to the euro at exactly the wrong
6225045 im feeling really different not only in my career but in my family and just me growing up period
6225046 its definitely a big change its a fun change though a good one
6225047 im getting ready to drive and boys are coming into my life theres a lot of good stuff going on
6225048 i hadnt heard anything about her until i found out about the script and then i researched her
6225049 it wasnt a situation where he had to really convince her
6225050 it was something that she and her uncle did just toss the football around and he thought she was good and he asked if she wanted to do it and she was like cool why not she always was like athletic and stuff
6225051 i still dont watch em but i love playing football
6225052 i would love to be a model or meet tyra banks or do modeling shoots and stuff
6225053 thats one of the reasons why i want to do these kinds of films is because theyre so inspirational to young kids and when i see how the kids react to me or the movies that i make it makes me feel so happy inside
6225054 i want to be a role model to them some girls or boys dont have role models that they can look up to in their own home or around them and i want to be that person if they dont
6225055 theyre able to do all these things and it just puts that idea in my mind where if they can do it then i definitely can do it
6225056 before i was not into it and i didnt really care
6225057 but now im very much into writing and its a lot easier for me to do i guess maybe just because being a teen ager i have a lot on my mind
6225058 i was every kind of geek and one of the geeks that i was was a band geek
6225059 a modern classic about a little girl who wants to join the high school football team
6225060 i gotta move with the acting thing because thats panning out
6225061 ive always been in supporting roles kind of reacting to other people and my character fish the heavy metal drummer hes got to drive the film its his energy and his wants and needs and desires that are the motor that push through the film and that definitely took some getting used to
6225062 fun things to do behind the kit to pump up the crowd and put on a show
6225063 theres so many disconnects in hollywood movies even in almost famous as great a movie as that is the music kind of sucks i mean who remembers fever dog as a song
6225064 you got to believe that this kid is writing these songs and can sing and play them he just looks so natural with a guitar slung over him and its such a great voice and you can tell that its his voice singing not some studio musicians voice
6225065 i got to hang out with him he was a great guy he has a really great sense of humor and a great sense of peace about the whole thing he is the original booted drummer and i guess the spark for the idea of the movie
6225066 ive waited on about a billion tables in my lifetime catered about a million catered events but i also had office jobs
6225067 what it gives you especially shakespeare and other classic texts is the importance of language and how to use it the importance of making strong choices about the character and about where they begin and where they end and the use of physicality to support the character and the language
6225068 people are really digging this movie i dont know about reviewers its not like the most original movie in the world i guess but its such a feel good fun old fashioned romp and audiences go crazy for it i think also movies nowadays are very r rated and dark the rocker kind of feels like a john hughes movie a fun for the whole family kind of rock comedy
6225069 inbev has asked us to fire the directors as a shareholder and investor id like to
6225070 i said it before and ill say it again inbev can bite me
6225071 of course he wants to decrease production numnuts switched to the euro at exactly the wrong
6225072 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6225073 today i will attune myself to god mind body and soul
6225074 this compromise budget proposal puts our state on the road to fiscal sanity and will give california a budget that works
6225075 i have made it very clear that we cannot tax our way out of this problem i do not believe in tax increases
6225076 i think the people of california are sending to sacramento plenty of dollars 130 some billions of dollars they are sending every year for us to function if we cannot function with that money then there is something wrong with the system rather than with the people i dont want to go back and ask them for any tax increases they deserve better than that
6225077 i think it is key for us that we finish this year with victories and not a another year where nothing gets done just because everyone is stuck in their ideology
6225078 i could see us playing more than one quarterback very easily
6225079 any abnormality that would not be lethal before a baby is born
6225080 the hope is that if you have a baby diagnosed prenatally with a defect then you can take cells from the amniotic fluid and then expand those cells in large quantities and create the tissue or organ that is needed
6225081 you could turn the cells for example into liver cells and have them ready for when the baby is born
6225082 its all still experimental but it shows we have the capacity to create these organs for transplant
6225083 will naturally migrate to the site of injury where tissue repair and regeneration can occur all without rejection
6225084 one could even have preventive cell tune ups to slow the natural process of ageing with periodic cell injections using a needle less system of course

6225091 we face so many shared global problems right now you need some kind of global communications medium through which citizens around the world can communicate and share ideas
6225092 we need to find ways to protect these commons as something essential for what you might call planetary democracy to thrive
6225093 that can be quite a time consuming laborious process and we created this really simple program that anyone should be able to operate
6225094 it really depends on the access you have to systems located outside of china
6225095 we know how to do it but its getting the message across the pages might be blocked maybe the people dont have the knowledge or the ability to install the software
6225096 what amazed me is the sophistication in how the filtering is being done
6225097 its really pervasive and from a technical point of view its very well done
6225098 it is hard to describe the pride i had in the company and the overwhelming thanks of the soldiers
6225099 were very proud of our employees and their involvement in the support of the troops
6225100 the people and the management are outstanding and truly make working here enjoyable
6225101 i have been provided the opportunity to make a difference in the operation direction and success of the company
6225102 i think its pretty simple certainly its a tremendous sacrifice for the national guard and the disruption that they have in their life to go and fight for our freedom
6225103 theyre sacrificing so much we can sacrifice just a little to support them

6225109 being on liberty with john mccain was like being in a train wreck
6225110 learned to fly at though his performance was below par at best good enough to get by he liked flying but didnt love it
6225111 flying too low over the he took out some power lines which led to a spate of newspaper stories in which he was predictably identified as the son of an admiral
6225112 in the fall of 1974 mccain was transferred to as the executive officer of replacement air group 174 the long sought flying billet at last a reality a few months later he assumed command of the rag which trained pilots and crews for carrier deployments the assignment was controversial some calling it favoritism a sop to the famous son of a famous father and grandfather since he had not first commanded a squadron the usual career path
6225113 off duty usually on routine cross country flights to john started carousing and running around with women to make matters worse some of the women with whom he was linked by rumor were subordinates at the time the rumors were so widespread that true or not they became part of mccains persona impossible not to take note of

6225118 and when i was on the website i noticed there was this thing called backstage with barack
6225119 and you had to fill in your name and your email address and you had to write a little blurb about why you were supporting him
6225120 i saw mccain at the dinner table a few times you know hello
6225121 that would be the extent of it he was a very quiet fellow and then one day he never came back and that was very very sad

6225133 it really was only a small number of kids involved but regardless drugs are a scourge in the community
6225134 in the process of weeding it out it got a lot of attention and people may have come to the wrong conclusion that its rampant here
6225135 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
6225136 very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp

6225140 i show my understanding towards liu xiang and we will continue to support liu xiang just as in the past after all the competition never belongs to any specific individual its about a kind of spirit instead i think we will continue to cooperate in 2009 and i believe he will be even better in the future
6225141 its clear to us that the olympics have been a watershed moment for mobile media
6225142 the time sensitive nature of the olympics and the around the clock schedule of events have led many mobile consumers to view their phones as the place to stay connected
6225143 we argue that weve already hit a critical mass of audience and with the olympics that audience is only going to get bigger i think we will see impressive numbers for mobile consumption with the olympics
6225144 consumers are really just looking for that olympic snack on their phone
6225145 we know that people are using the phone to look at the tv schedule to look at the medal counts to look at highlights photos of the day and consumers are even looking at athlete info on their phones and are just reading up a little bit on the athletes and really surrounding themselves with contextual data from the olympics that get them pumped up for watching the events live in the evening
6225146 sip entertainment where you are just sipping little bit here and there
6225147 you want to check in and see how many medals your country is getting or see highlights of the latest michael phelps swim and i think that it makes sense
6225148 youre not going to watch it for three hours in your living room with your significant other with a bowl of popcorn
6225149 we shouldnt have to pay for it if we have to sit through commercials but if the commercials are taken out and its reasonable i think canadians are willing to pay for it if its not going to go over their cellphone data plan
6225150 maybe in the future when you buy a digital package you will pay a little more a month for mobile access

6225178 i think we are ready for the world cup qualifiers i think we did well in the first half and put petr cech under a lot of pressure he was their best player and made three good saves
6225179 the czechs are a very good team which is why i wanted to play them they are not easy to beat but we created chances especially in the first half and played well but we suffered when they counter attacked and this is a problem we must work on
6225180 i can see progression i think we are moving forward
6225181 we started the match with the idea of surviving which we managed we were attacking well from the break
6225182 maybe if we had started the second half 1 0 up it would have been better for us but although it shook us marek jankulovsvki scored a beautiful goal from his free kick
6225183 we controlled the game for most of the second half and they did not have too many scoring chances but england are a very strong team who played right to the end and it was a shame we conceded such a late goal

6225422 a lot of definite language sloganeering and waving the flag
6225423 a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we are trying to confront evil
6225424 i think that we should and ive said this publicly that we should set up a system of performance pay for teachers negotiated with teachers work with the teachers to figure out the assessment so they feel like they are being judged fairly that it is not the whim of the principal that it is not based on a single test but the basic notion that teaching is a profession that teachers are underpaid so we need to pay them all more and create a higher base line but then we should also reward excellence
6225425 you know i remember what my mother used to tell me i was talking to somebody a while back and i said the one time that she would get really angry with me is if she ever thought that i was being mean to somebody or unfair to somebody she said imagine standing in their shoes imagine looking through their eyes that basic idea of empathy and that i think is whats made america special is that notion that everybody has got a shot if we see somebody down and out if we see a kid who cant afford college that we care for them too and i want to be president because thats the america i believe in and i feel like that american dream is slipping away
6225426 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than their self interest i believe that americas best days are ahead of us but i also believe that we face enormous challenges both national security and domestic as we have found out in the last few days in the case of georgia
6225427 the national press is basically giving mccain a pass on the mccain campaigns double talk about obamas patriotism
6225428 for the first time in our country republicans will give a damn about service reform prosperity and peace

6225431 3d was meant to be seen in 3d and its great to see an organization like mtbs plant a flag firmly in the ground and state with determination that they want the real thing and you know what i think they will get it too the game creators are very pleased to have been awarded an mtbs certification for the implementation of s 3d technology in the latest update to dark basic professional we look forward to extending our native support for s 3d to our other brands including darkgdk and fps creator in the near future

6225433 to make this happen we used the popular iz3d s 3d drivers along with real d technology real d is the same technology used in modern movie theaters for successful films like beowulf 3d u23d and journey to the center of the earth 3d special thanks go to rob engle of sony imageworks siggraph tdvision corp iz3d and nvidia and real d for supplying the specialized equipment needed to make this possible

6225447 burkes garden is a geologic marvel gods thumbprint its called the highest valley in virginia the garden as those who live here refer to it is more than 3 000 feet above sea level and looks from above like a blooming volcano but actually its whats left of a collapsed mountain ringed by some of the states loftiest peaks including beartown mountain the garden is 9 miles long and 5 miles wide a lush bowl of fertile pastures and cornfields that is at once welcoming and isolated if your preferred mode of travel is a paved road you have only one option to enter the valley state route 623 a steep twisting affair that snakes over the mountain from the town of tazewell the garden is home to about 200 full time residents whose names including directions to their homes can be found on signposts at the entrance to the valley perhaps 100 more come for weekends and summers in the early 1900s more than 1 000 resided in the valley before the arrival of tractors and other mechanized farm equipment reduced the need for many of the laborers who lived here the garden is discovered on a regular basis by tourists in cars on bicycles and on foot hikers from the nearby appalachian trail stop in to pick up their mail or a cold drink or a ride if theyve had enough of the backwoods a good time to check out the place is the annual burkes garden fall festival sept 29 8 a m 3 p m burkes garden gained its name from a 1748 survey team that included a man named james burke who after a meal left the peelings of potatoes near a campfire a year later he and others returned to find a crop of potatoes waiting for them a hunting and fishing paradise for american indians for centuries the garden was settled by european pioneers in the early 1800s word of its beauty and splendid seclusion circulated in the late 1800s according to local lore agents for the fabulously wealthy vanderbilts chose the valley as the place they wanted to build a family castle but landowners in the garden refused to sell as a result biltmore americas largest home was constructed in asheville n c

6225451 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6225452 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6225453 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment

6225469 we need this money to proceed along to expand our plant and create the jobs we need to keep this area economically viable
6225470 unless we expand that facility we dont have a future frankly the towns of jay and troy wont have the future they want either
6225471 this will change the lives of our staff and these two communities
6225472 jay peak tends to use a lot of local contractors to do their work

6225474 as we look to expand the ea sports brand and captivate sports fans from around the world with rich new interactive experiences it was obvious that the renaissance were seeing in the sport of tennis provides us with a big opportunity
6225475 our new tennis franchise coming first to the wii will put fans right into the action and provide the excitement tension and drama that true champions feel in legendary matches like the classic from wimbledon just last month

6225478 i actually wanted to flip it i thought you shouldnt smoke until youre 21 and drink when you turn 18 i think its a great idea
6225479 purdue supports the dialog initiated by the amethyst initiative particularly its strategy to invite new ideas about the best ways to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol
6225480 as you get older you learn to discern the difference between right and wrong at 18 youre really not old enough to handle something like that
6225481 18 year olds were buying alcohol for their 15 16 17 year old friends when they changed it back to 21 in all those states they found that there was less drinking and driving less drunk driving accidents etcetera
6225482 the situation there as hard as it is it could do with less hype and exaggeration
6225483 at the moment some un agencies appear to be doing damage in respect of parroting totally unfounded reports by some agencies without in any way trying to verify the facts
6225484 our initial plans were designed to curtail the influence of the jihadists there and to try to prevent them from taking the whole of somalia under their control we did that in a number of weeks
6225485 there has not been any indiscriminate firing on our side because it would be completely suicidal for us to engage in such an activity
6225486 our intention is to give space to recreate the somali state you do not create the somali state by firing indiscriminately into civilian areas and civilian targets
6225487 nevertheless it is quite true that when you fight in built up areas there are bound to be civilian causalities and these are extremely regrettable
6225488 i understand why the african union does not have the resources to fulfil its promise
6225489 but i hope that those who have the resources will support the african union so they can deploy the peacekeeping troops
6225490 amnestys allegations are unsubstantiated lies and propaganda that they have received from islamic groups in somalia
6225491 those who are responsible include members of recognised armed forces who should be held accountable for their actions
6225492 try your best to treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself and you will find that this is the shortest way to benevolence
6225493 we caught it this time but who knows if this has happened other times and with other planes that are out there
6225494 if we are not getting additional funding within the coming two weeks we will have to close down a number of life saving feeding activities in the central south by the end of march
6225495 life in somalia for the idps internally displaced people but also the ordinary people is extreme
6225496 if you take all the indicators for children its the most difficult place on the globe
6225497 the sticks and scraps of cloth i need will cost me about 9 4 50
6225498 i dont know if this is the worst humanitarian situation in the world
6225499 it may well be but it is certainly the most difficult one for the un and other aid agencies to address because of the insecurity
6225500 they were trained in afghanistan by the taliban and by osama bin laden they are al qaeda of course
6225501 what the us and everyone else says is true there are terrorists in somalia
6225502 chi ha 2 pollici e se ne frega di quello che dici bob kelso
6225503 it was an attack if we say too much then we give away platforms and things that we use
6225504 it was an attack against a known al qaeda target and militia leader in somalia
6225505 we heard a huge explosion and when we ran out of our house we saw balls of smoke and flames coming out of house
6225506 the house was totally destroyed to the ground also other houses nearby
6225507 the house that was attacked was a small concrete villa and it has been destroyed
6225508 the adjacent houses which were made from traditional mud were also destroyed the sight is quite horrific
6225509 this incident will cause a lot problems to us interests in the region and the governments who support the us by that i mean its allies who are puppets
6225510 i am letting the citizens of the us and the allies know they are not going to be safe in this area
6225511 the problem is twofold the ships themselves can get hijacked and we lose the food my biggest problem is that i cant find enough vessels that are willing to do this work for me unless they get an escort
6225512 about five masked men armed with pistols came to our camp they ordered us to get into our make shift houses and then after a few minutes we heard shots when we came out three of our men were lying there
6225513 we do not know why our colleagues were targeted but we suspect it is because they were active in the recent protests against the killings of the aid workers someone wants to silence us we do not know who
6225514 it is deplorable that amnesty international has lent itself to an obviously disgraceful smear campaign against the armed forces of ethiopia using highly emotive even racist language
6225515 we have said repeatedly that our soldiers are the most disciplined soldiers in the world
6225516 they have never cut anybodys throat never gang raped any women never deliberately shot civilians in somalia
6225517 nothing justifies gang rape slitting the throats of civilians or disproportionate attacks
6225518 a young childs throat was slit by ethiopian soldiers in front of the childs mother
6225519 the cutting of throats of even enemies is not in the tradition of ethiopian troops
6225520 nel mio provvedimento non esistono riferimenti diretti o indiretti allappartenenza del ragazzo ad alcun partito o circolo non ho mai citato il prc n parlato di una sua militanza comunista non capisco come si possa montare una cosa simile
6225521 laddove scrive si segnalano le carenze genitoriali della madre dei due minorenni e la vita sregolata del 16enne
6225522 lirregolare frequenza scolastica i mancati rientri a casa seppure con il beneplacito materno e la frequentazione di luoghi giovanili ove diffuso luso di sostanze alcoliche e psicotrope
6225523 i luoghi a cui si fa riferimento potrebbero essere bar discoteche laffido condiviso del ragazzo in questo caso stato escluso perch la madre aveva difficolt a gestire il figlio
6225524 stiamo ancora cercando di capire i motivi che hanno spinto il tribunale a prendere questa decisione il ragazzo non si droga non ha commesso reati la cosa che ci ha colpiti che viene citato come appartenente ad un gruppo estremista secondo noi stato montato un caso sul nulla
6225525 mio figlio va al mare e studia dice la madre ha avuto tre debiti al penultimo anno del classico in greco latino e filosofia come pu essere sereno con questa guerra in atto
6225526 in questo momento il tribunale per i minorenni di catania sta decidendo se mandare il ragazzo in comunit come richiesto dagli assistenti sociali con laiuto di alcuni consulenti ha aggiunto il legale stiamo cercando di preparare una richiesta al tribunale per un riesame della vicenda
6225527 i comunisti sono unorganizzazione estremista solo perch fuori dal parlamento ci vogliono fuori legge
6225528 appartenere a un partito comunista motivo cos disdicevole per un ragazzo tanto da accusare la madre e non fargli avere laffidamento del figlio
6225529 sou tantas que mal consigo me distinguir sou estrategista batalhadora por m tra da pela como o num piscar de olhos fico terna delicada
6225530 i am sad to be leaving the fa an organisation it has been a privilege to lead but i believe it is in the best interests of all parties
6225531 i have always endeavored to do my job with passion decency and integrity and i believe i am leaving a strong legacy for the future

6225539 the company is optimistic that first production from dolores will take place at the end of the third quarter but notes this may be pushed back to early in the fourth quarter as a result of the most recent illegal blockade
6225540 although we expect that the environment will continue to remain challenging we will continue to conservatively manage the financial aspects of the business while at the same time provide compelling assortments and exciting store experiences to build our brands
6225541 if people think they lehman are heading toward bankruptcy nobody will want to do business with them or make them new loans thats fulds biggest problem
6225542 they are clearly not as keen on investing in the financial sector until the credit crisis plays out
6225543 selling off assets would be at fire sale prices and investors will bark if you try and sell some of the crown jewels of the company
6225544 we anticipate that lehman will reduce its overall mortgage exposure by 20 per cent suggesting about a 15 billion reduction
6225545 buy them some time and allow them to emerge from the crisis and rebuild
6225546 there is simply too much lending capacity in the global economy
6225547 theyre folks who dont typically need the social badge of a premium brand theyre confident in themselves and in their own skin
6225548 how much will the hyundai badge deter buyers who want a premium vehicle
6225549 it was an extremely expensive vehicle with a volkswagen badge on it
6225550 the same sales guy who is going to sell you your luxury car is going to sell you a teeny subcompact
6225551 thats part of the reason why were gaining market share this year
6225552 this is moving the brand in a different direction and youre starting to push up against some heavy hitters out there in terms of brand image
6225553 its difficult to go after that with a product from more of a mainstream brand
6225554 the government now has daggers pointing at it from all directions
6225555 it is facing a multi front war with no prospect of a military victory
6225556 we urged the ethiopian military not to go into somalia
6225557 the cost for the people of mogadishu has been unacceptable
6225558 more than 600 000 people were forced from their homes in mogadishu in 2007 by fighting and the worst cereals harvest in 13 years in middle and lower shabelle traditionally the most agriculturally productive regions of the whole country
6225559 these discussions should preferably be held in a location close to somalia or in one where most observers following the situation in the country are based
6225560 i am preparing the agenda identifying a possible list of participants and the timing for this process
6225561 the somali people must create a situation that would allow the ethiopians to leave
6225562 oh we already hired someone but we wanted to hear what you had to say because we thought he sounded knowledgeable
6225563 al shabab is a violent and brutal extremist group with a number of officials affiliated to al qaeda
6225564 al shabab feels honoured to be included on the list we are good muslims and the americans are infidels we are on the right path
6225565 we are fighting a jihad to rid somalia of the ethiopians and its allies the secular somali stooges

6225579 there is no indication that the israelis were involved in the 9 11 attacks but investigators suspect that the israelis may have gathered intelligence about the attacks in advance and not shared it
6225580 it wasnt some anti semitic conspiracy crank sitting in his parents basement or iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad who first linked israeli nationals to the events of 9 11 it was the u s government specifically its law enforcement arm

6225587 this just shows the true objective of green activism environmentalists dont actually want us to find alternative ways of producing energy they want us to stop using energy altogether
6225588 the basic premise of environmentalism is to leave nature alone capturing and utilizing any source of energy even ones that are supposedly green and renewable will necessarily have some impact on nature and will therefore inevitably be subject to environmentalist attacks and condemnation
6225589 since the use of energy is an indispensable component of everything we do in our lives the greens opposition to even such ridiculous impractical sources of energy as solar and wind reveals their basic animus against human life

6225602 its tough when you see grand theft auto iv out there as the biggest thing going right now when theyre making hundreds of millions of dollars and we dont see any of it i dont blame rockstar i blame our union for not having the agreements in place to protect the creative people who drive the sales of these games
6225603 this facility like those used by other central banks has been designed in case the global credit markets deteriorate further and make cash difficult to access but the likelihood of this being needed remains extremely low
6225604 i can assure you we are well aware of the cost for people who have been unfortunately caught up in the fallout
6225605 but it is important to keep a sense of perspective
6225606 the majority of institutions accounting for over 90 per cent of household financial assets are not directly affected by these current events these institutions are well capitalised businesses and give no apparent reason for concern
6225607 our banks are navigating their way through the current turmoil well

6225616 this year everybody is going to leave with something from our sponsors
6225617 they donated quite a bit of stuff so well have a little something for everyone as they leave
6225618 at all the conventions that ive gone to in the past 12 years ive noticed that during the daytime things are calm and family friendly but once the kids have gone to bed it turns into a big party
6225619 people come to meet people and play whether sexual or otherwise so we wanted to put something together that really catered to just adults
6225620 what most people dont understand about the proverbial modern geek is that we have just as much of an interest in adult products as anyone else
6225621 one only has to spend a couple of hours witnessing the debauchery that occurs during the evening hours at such conventions to understand this

6225626 in the beginning when we were shooting michael had to keep reminding us like you guys dont like each other yet i started to get really protective of angie as the film went on when kate would kind of attack her or anyone else would i would feel a very natural sense of wanting to protect her so it got a little easier when we had to argue as the film went on

6225630 you never picture yourself coming home with a medal due to a dq
6225631 every time i look at it im going to be like this medal was given to me
6225632 i just stood there like man what do i do
6225633 by the time they announced the dq they were already lining up for the 400 hurdles i didnt want to take a victory lap anyway that just didnt seem classy to me
6225634 he did the whole victory lap and had the flag for the whole world to see
6225635 thats heartbreaking if that was me i probably would have broken down and cried right there on worldwide television
6225636 we then went through the rules process we wanted to make sure that the results of the race were fair

6225647 video is the next big thing on the web and more and more organizations are embracing it as the way to provide an equal experience for web surfers who dont necessarily have the time to watch television during the day but for all the video services and there are many hulu easily stands above the rest and provides us with the best programming and experience call me a cynic but watching the junk on youtube or the ridiculous garbage on funny or die just doesnt do it for me instead i prefer to enjoy professional programming in a way that has never been allowed before but the beauty of hulu goes far beyond programming hulu is real proof that the entertainment industry is slowly coming around to the idea of embracing the web and not being afraid of it and proves a point ive been making all along most people are honest and are more than willing to do the right thing to enjoy their favorite shows hulu is the first example of how to overcome the debilitating crossroads that were now standing in and has shown with each passing day that where theres great programming and a free service people will flock
6225648 every night that i work i tend to see families who have never been here before and how we know that is they dont know what to do dont know where to get drink dont know where to get silverware

6225659 our goals havent changed win the conference qualifying for playoffs we want to practice on thanksgiving
6225660 we have something to prove a lot of people are questioning morgantown
6225661 our strength this year is our running back and the quarterback
6225662 were trying to get that target on our back great mentality we want to be top dog

6225664 various stages of negotiations with all u s based carriers
6225665 you are absolutely on point about giving passengers a reason to smile as a number are around me this afternoon
6225666 the purser on this flight just came up to tell me about the happy reactions she has been getting from passengers i get the feeling she doesnt get that too often
6225667 we support most corporate vpns virtual private networks so that passengers can utilize the service in full compliance with their business security requirements in addition we are also working with isps that serve corporations ipass is one that weve announced so that passengers who are required to gain access through that enhanced security service can also use gogo
6225668 we considered a number of different options when we looked at this technology
6225669 the reason we went with aircell is that they offer the most robust option out there the equipment is lightweight equipment so from a fuel perspective were not concerned there
6225670 we think that the satellite based connectivity for us is a more robust experience for our customers
6225671 we believe its more consistent than air to ground we want to test it to see what the customer experience is before we install it on all our aircraft
6225672 the huge issue has been the cost of putting the systems into the planes
6225673 its made it very difficult to have a reasonable expectation to earn money off the system
6225674 i think an awful lot of people will find it attractive twelve dollars for a five hour flight is nothing if it provides sufficiently fast service for people who like to surf the web and arent driven crazy by slow speeds the business traveler doesnt surf the web they want to send and receive e mails its pretty straightforward and you dont need tremendous connectivity to do that
6225675 as we do with other content we provide onboard we trust that our customers will use good judgment and that will prevail
6225676 our flight attendants are pretty well trained to deal with and handle situations where someone is displaying inappropriate content
6225677 fantasy is really where the strongest interest is and where the money is in sports online

6225680 what differentiates us from other web 2 0 companies is that they are too niche oriented and are not going after the bulk of the marketplace
6225681 but theres lots of opinions for people to read before theyre quickly shut down
6225682 we were curious about what they were going to do during the olympics so our testing was tailored for that
6225683 we were interested in whether there was going to be different filtering policies for those in the media center and other places in beijing and other places in china the answer seems to be no and thats interesting

6225688 steve bough is a deeply respected member of the democratic party in living memory hes the first democratic chair to be voted in by acclamation thats very impressive especially for a committee that histoicaly has done very little by acclamation including ordering lunch
6225689 democrats have a lot of challenges weve got a great year ahead of us im glad were unified
6225690 sadly we cannot offer the definitive guide to beijing cuisine in this space charged with the most grueling and time consuming assignment at these summer games covering michael phelps and his quest for eight gold medals weve had little time for culinary adventure much of our dining has come in between assignments and interviews in the first floor cafeteria of the main press center as kevin would attest mcdonalds is one of the more popular options for both american and foreign journalists during the past two weeks here there are a couple of meals however that do stand out we arrived for a phelps related appearance this week about an hour early certain that our cab driver would get lost as every previous one had oddly this one didnt and with an hour to kill we wandered into a restaurant called fat mother for lunch it was a hot pot restaurant and there was a hole in the middle of our table with a burner beneath it once we ordered our soup broth a pot was placed in the hole and it wasnt long before the soup inside started to boil wed innocently ordered a chili soup thinking we could tackle the fiery challenge with tiny red peppers swimming about the soup looked very much like a juicy lava wed soon learn that it tasted this way as well the fat mother staff brought trays of food to our table uncooked mushrooms spinach beef prawns potato noodles ham using chopsticks we dunked our food item in the soup allowing it to cook sufficiently before pulling it out cooling it off with a peanut dipping sauce and enjoying it was relatively easy to eat mostly because after just the tip of any food item touched your mouth your tongue went instantly numb like i said we mistakenly ordered the lava soup the heat never seemed to cool we went through a pair of cokes apiece and i had a pile of about a half dozen crumpled napkins that had tended to my running nose the eyes and antennae scared kevin from even biting into a prawn but he didnt want to offend the staff at fat mother so he dumped half the slimy critters into the bottom of the soup we left with a sense of accomplishment from dipping into the volcano in the middle of our table and bragged to many people throughout the day unfortunately only three or four hours passed before my stomach began to rumble it felt like a troop of 12 year old chinese gymnasts were performing deep inside me needless to say fat mother left a lasting impression weve had a couple of meals here that cost in the 25 50 range but my best meal came from outside of beijing and cost just dollar visiting the szechuan province devastated by an earthquake four months ago we stopped and ordered a bowl of noodles from a storefront restaurant we ate on a picnic table set up on the sidewalk the long flat noodles were in a red spicy broth the heat tolerable but noticeable and was topped with parsley and a fried egg the flavor was thick and soothing hitting your nose long before the chopsticks even reached your mouth the meal was packed with superlatives for this trip it was the cheapest meal the biggest serving and the most flavor a taste ill dream about back home for years to come
6225691 its a scary thought that your parent has been taken and used and you know how hard they have worked their whole life to earn that money
6225692 there were irs agents calling her lawyers calling fbi agents calling
6225693 i called the number and they told me it had been disconnected
6225694 the scammers are changing the numbers to isolate the victim
6225695 she will tell you that she understands and she is not going to do it again but depending on who calls that afternoon they may have her talked into sending more money by that afternoon
6225696 i want to say that human rights matters to us every year not just in the olympic year
6225697 support for the games and engagement with china is not at the expense of human rights
6225698 it is integral to their promotion china has made enormous social and
6225699 i firmly believe that allowing chinas citizens to enjoy freedom of expression and association to worship how and where they wish and to live in confidence that the rule of law will be applied consistently and impartially is not only the right thing to do but will also benefit chinas future stability and prosperity which is in all our interests
6225700 i am just so happy it was such a hard race and i had such a hard week its the best thing in the world i love my mum and dad so much they are so supportive and my boyfriend greg my coach tom is such a legend i am so f happy i just wanted to sail as fast as i could well done to the chinese and italian girls they have raced so well this week i am so happy to be among the medals its unreal i am just so happy

6225717 we do not simply advocate lowering the drinking age as a solution to a very serious problem
6225718 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
6225719 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6225720 it should be obvious to anyone that the current system is broken and isnt doing what it should to protect the health safety and well being of our children
6225721 and if what we are doing now doesnt work then we have an obligation to ourselves and to society to explore what might
6225722 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
6225723 we dont think just giving up and lowering the age is going to be the solution
6225724 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
6225725 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
6225726 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
6225727 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
6225728 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
6225729 has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me

6225734 we realized there was such interest and excitement in these categories to do with height that it was too important a category for us to leave it to a doctor alone
6225735 so we decided to tighten things up completely to make sure there was no doubt
6225736 he has gone on record saying he doesnt want to be bothered basically he doesnt want the fame and publicity that comes with being the worlds tallest man
6225737 whether or not thats the real reason im not sure but thats what hes told us
6225738 need glory i just want a normal life under normal conditions
6225739 he was a bit of a recluse he looked after goats then the fame that he got from being a guinness world record holder meant that he found himself a wife his life improved

6225742 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
6225743 hes got to be very concerned by the neck in neck polls and by what happened at saddleback
6225744 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6225745 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6225746 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain
6225747 speaking to a cuban american audience in miami in august 2007 he said
6225748 we do have to crack down on those employers that are taking advantage of the situation
6225749 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6225750 one of the nicest places in the world to live in
6225751 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
6225752 no i didnt no no sometimes im given to a little hyperbole
6225753 yesterday he obama suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
6225754 we can do that decrease our dependence as a nation we can turned out sic the lights five minutes earlier we dont have to drive the extra block
6225755 im proud of that record from fighting for the recognition of doctor martin luther kings birthday in my state to sponsoring specific legislation that would prevent discrimination
6225756 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6225757 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6225758 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6225759 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6225760 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose any serious threat to us
6225761 if that strategy made sense and would lead ultimately to the pullout of u s troops but in the short term required additional troop strength to protect those who are already on the ground then thats something i would support
6225762 given the situation on the ground i think if we had our troops out in four years that would be an extraordinary accomplishment
6225763 well obviously its going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues and jerusalem will be part of those negotiations
6225764 what the world should interpret is my consistent position which is i believe in trade
6225765 i just want to make sure that the rules of the road apply to everybody and they are fair and that they reflect the interests of workers and not just corporate profits
6225766 i said well i would always reserve the right to go in and strike against al qaeda if they were in iraq so ya know this is how politics works mccain thought that he could make a clever point by saying well let me give you some news barack al qaeda is in iraq like i wasnt reading the papers like i like i didnt know what was going on
6225767 well first of all i do know that al qaeda is in iraq thats why ive said we should continue to strike al qaeda targets but i have some news for john mccain and that is that there was no such thing as al qaeda in iraq until george bush and john mccain decided to invade iraq
6225768 i intend to bring it to an end so that we can actually start going after al qaeda in afghanistan and in the hills of pakistan like we should have been doing in the first place thats the news john mccain
6225769 when we talked back in november of 04 after your election i said theres been enormous speculation about your political future
6225770 i will serve out my full six year term you know tim if you get asked enough sooner or later you get weary and you start looking for new ways of saying things but my thinking has not changed
6225771 so you will not run for president or vice president in 2008
6225772 i happen to be a proponent of single payer universal healthcare coverage thats what id like to see
6225773 i never said that we should try to go ahead and get single payer healthcare
6225774 he gets an asterisk that says he is trying to be different but overall the same wealthy interests are funding his campaign as are funding other candidates whether or not they are lobbyists
6225775 a ccording to the center for responsive politics 14 of obamas top 20 contributors employed lobbyists this year spending a total of 16 2 million to influence the federal government in the first six months of 2007
6225776 contrary to the claims of some i have no interest in sitting down with our adversaries just for the sake of talking but as president of the united states i would be willing to lead tough and principled diplomacy with the appropriate iranian leaders at a time and place of my choosing if and only if it can advance the interests of the united states
6225777 w ould you be willing to meet separately without precondition during the first year of your administration in washington or anywhere else with the leaders of iran syria venezuela cuba and north korea in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries
6225778 i would and the reason is this that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration is ridiculous
6225779 senator youve said before that youd meet with president ahmadinejad
6225780 yeah nothings changed with respect to my belief that strong countries and strong presidents talk to their enemies and talk to their adversaries i find many of president ahmadinejads statements odious and ive said that repeatedly and i think that we have to recognize that there are a lot of rogue nations in the world that dont have american interests at heart but what i also believe is that as john f kennedy said we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate
6225781 sen obamas nod to lowering corporate taxes comes as republicans have been attacking him for proposals that would raise the cost of doing business such as his pledge to raise the tax rate on capital gains and his vow to increase the top income tax rates which are often used by small unincorporated enterprises he didnt say how deeply he would cut the rate but said it could be trimmed in return for reducing corporate tax breaks simplifying the tax system
6225782 one other issue thats of great importance here in the district as well is gun control you said in idaho recently im quoting here i have no intention of taking away folks guns but you support the d c handgun ban
6225783 barack obama aligned himself with welfare reform on monday launching a television ad which touts the way the overhaul slashed the rolls by 80 percent obama leaves out however that he was against the 1996 federal legislation which precipitated the caseload reduction
6225784 i dont think that we can take nuclear power off the table
6225785 sen barack obama msnbc democrat presidential candidate debate hanover nh 9 26 07
6225786 sen barack obama remarks at town hall event newton ia 12 30 07
6225787 under this compromise legislation an important tool in the fight against terrorism will continue it does however grant retroactive immunity and i will work in the senate to remove this provision so that we can seek full accountability for past offenses so i support the compromise but do so with a firm pledge that as president i will carefully monitor the program review the report by the inspectors general and work with the congress to take any additional steps i deem necessary to protect the lives and the liberty of the american people
6225788 senator whats your reaction to the supreme courts decision today striking down the death penalty for a child rapist
6225789 i disagree with the decision i have said repeatedly that i think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes i think that the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision that under narrow limited well defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable that that does not violate our constitution now i think its you know had the supreme court said we want to constrain the ability of the states to do this to make sure that its done in a careful and appropriate way that would have been one thi ng but it basically had a blanket prohibition and i disagreed with that decision
6225790 i am happy to have a debate with john mccain and george bush about foreign policy if john mccain wants to meet me anywhere anytime to have a debate about our respective policies in iraq iran the middle east or around the world that is a conversation i am happy to have because i believe that there is no separation between john mccain and george bush when it comes to our middle east policy and i think their policy has failed
6225791 sen obama has looked at this issue he recognizes that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we need to look at this strategically and
6225792 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
6225793 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
6225794 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
6225795 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6225796 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
6225797 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
6225798 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6225799 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6225800 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6225801 i had no idea it would be such a big deal
6225802 does that have anything to do with the new indiana jones movie
6225803 i wear a bra all the time except when i go to sleep
6225804 when i was in sixth grade i had double d boobs

6225868 a lot of members thought it would be a driveable par 4 for the pros said don mahoney the vice chairman of the barclays and a member at ridgewood for 30 years
6225869 it plays 18 yards up the hill according to the bushnell range finder that my caddy just bought me he said chuckling
6225870 i dont see why i should lay back and let the birdie come to me when i can go chase that thing down
6225871 i hit the surface every time and obviously the pins might be to where i cant hit driver if the pin is in the front and i probably will lay up and probably try to suck something back off the middle of the green and play safe that way he said
6225872 but if the pin is in the back im probably going to hit driver there every day
6225873 theres a massive reward for going for it and hitting a great shot said the 2006 u
6225874 theres a massive penalty for going for it and hitting a bad shot theres still no guarantee if you play ultra conservatively youve still got to hit a great pitch shot
6225875 its so small its like an old little par 3 golf course green said hes never seen a green that small in his life
6225876 i noticed any of the guys that hit full sand wedges no matter where they hit it on the green it came off the green he said
6225877 if you get just enough spin it will come off every time even if you land it on the back of the green
6225878 i think the secret to the hole is to hit it up there as close as you can in the rough to where you cant get any spin it will be an interesting week
6225879 jack was playing a practice round and his caddy made a comment to him about the putt breaking toward 17 meaning route 17 mahoney said
6225880 jack interpreted it as meaning hole 17 which is all the way the hell over on the other side of the course so jack looked at him cockeyed like what the hell kind of read is that when they finally connected it was a riot
6225881 its a 4 iron to a 5 wood thats ball park johnson said
6225882 but then you have to hit a great wedge shot not long but youve got to hit it
6225883 you can hit a great tee shot and still make a bogey you can lay up and make birdie you can lay up and make bogey
6225884 a little out of the norm for what we play now verplank said

6225903 show that while china has now proven it is able to host international events to perfection it still has a long way to go before it respects even minimal international human rights standards
6225904 china is riding roughshod over its promises to allow lawful protests during the games
6225905 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law
6225906 as the coach for the boston breakers of the womens united soccer association in 2003 we talked about changing the point of attack and changing speed and she was average
6225907 i saw her for the first time in december with the u s team and something happened as she decided to get fit and change speed she has been one of the most important players in this team
6225908 its been a few years since ive played forward and i havent been in this position where ive been able to shoot this much and have these kind of scoring opportunities
6225909 being part of the olympics is a huge thing much less being able to play in an olympic final match i love being able to score goals if thats whats asked of me and any way i can contribute im happy to do that
6225910 id like to tell you a time on it but i cant i dont know what that time is on it
6225911 he practiced tuesday and just felt like he couldnt get up and go full speed

6225914 wales are not a small footballing nation and to win is the best day of my life
6225915 its a big result for the country and our new manager hector cuper in his first match because he has now seen the players and will be able to put them in their best positions
6225916 we will expect a similar game with ireland as we got from wales they play with a similar style of play and system to the rest of the british isles
6225917 i dont think in terms of living up to beijing or making direct comparisons
6225918 eighty per cent of the organization is uniform to all olympics the other 20 per cent is adapted to the environment youre working in these games are being done on a grander scale than anything the olympic movement has ever witnessed i dont sit here saying london has to do it that way
6225919 this is the biggest global moment weve had thus far and the biggest global moment well have until our own opening ceremony
6225920 youll get a short and small glimpse of our dna
6225921 there is a clear understanding that we have to deliver as a nation in 2012
6225922 you can describe these games as a stand alone games in their own right but theyre also a stepping stone to london 2012
6225923 the success of the games in london as judged by the man and woman in the street will be determined by how many british athletes are on the podium with a medal around their neck thats why a good level of performance here was critical to inspire the nation on the eve of becoming the next host nation
6225924 we are really going to have to step up to the plate in sports where we traditionally havent medalled with consistency or havent medalled at all
6225925 what weve witnessed here offers us a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on that and get more kids involved in sport
6225926 millions of people back at home and kids have now been exposed to these sports that some never knew before
6225927 to remain relevant you have to deliver a games that leaves benefits long after the games have left town
6225928 we are not going to run the thing down but we are going to deliver value for money and im absolutely determined that we are not going to waste taxpayers money and that means that over the next few months we will be looking at ways of ensuring we maximize bang for our buck
6225929 his arm is alive and ripping i dont know if he couldve done any better im really encouraged by that

6225938 they were good last year and gave us everything we wanted last year with a backup quarterback
6225939 hes doing great wouldnt you 60 million richer hes doing wonderful
6225940 i think weve been on our heels definitely these last two preseason games
6225941 not from the scoreboard but just from the play within the games were behind and we need to pick it up
6225942 it looked like a completely different team out there against tampa bay and how they were ready and we werent they treated it like a game and we went out there treating it as a scrimmage
6225943 so we cant do anything about that we have to get better as a team without him
6225944 im not saying i went out there and every run was the best i ran hard and did the best with the carries i had but i still have room to get better
6225945 i tell my kid sister that she should act like a lady and not give her pussy away

6225967 i got pushed in the back and hit the quarterbacks back of his foot and my fingers kind of slid between them
6225968 i didnt think it was as bad as they said it was

6225979 in the current environment it is hard to find any specific triggers for these moves
6225980 i think were seeing consolidation but personally i think that theres scope for a rebound in the aussie dollar
6225981 the us dollar is consolidating after what we saw in the last couple of weeks which were fairly dramatic moves
6225982 we think this pullback is going to happen eventually in the short term however the overall sentiment remains us dollar positive

6225986 there was an absolute shift in thinking about the border from drug interdiction alien interdiction criminal interdiction at our borders to one of national security
6225987 there is literally no protection there are some border patrol agents but at night i could assure you i could go into mexico and return to the united states carrying a suitcase nuke
6225988 and if we cannot control our borders if we cannot control who comes here were never going to have national security
6225989 we need a steady funding stream as we move into the next few years to make sure were able to sustain the investments weve made in technology and infrastructure along our borders
6225990 we are trying to bring the agreement to a close it is not done yet
6225991 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6225992 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6225993 its time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6225994 everyone says america is the land of opportunity for renewables
6225995 i want to say that human rights matters to us every year not just in the olympic year
6225996 support for the games and engagement with china is not at the expense of human rights
6225997 it is integral to their promotion china has made enormous social and economic progress over the last three decades but much more remains to be done
6225998 i firmly believe that allowing chinas citizens to enjoy freedom of expression and association to worship how and where they wish and to live in confidence that the rule of law will be applied consistently and impartially is not only the right thing to do but will also benefit chinas future stability and prosperity which is in all our interests
6225999 the human rights of all those in tibet should be fully respected our consistent position is that the way to resolve the issues highlighted by the disturbances in march is through dialogue not violence
6226000 you never picture yourself coming home with a medal due to a dq
6226001 every time i look at it im going to be like this medal was given to me
6226002 i just stood there like man what do i do
6226003 by the time they announced the dq they were already lining up for the 400 hurdles i didnt want to take a victory lap anyway that just didnt seem classy to me
6226004 he did the whole victory lap and had the flag for the whole world to see
6226005 thats heartbreaking if that was me i probably would have broken down and cried right there on worldwide television
6226006 we then went through the rules process we wanted to make sure that the results of the race were fair
6226007 in the current environment it is hard to find any specific triggers for these moves
6226008 i think were seeing consolidation but personally i think that theres scope for a rebound in the aussie dollar

6226014 i think we are ready for the world cup qualifiers
6226015 i think we did well in the first half and put petr cech under a lot of pressure he was their best player and made three good saves
6226016 the czechs are a very good team which is why i wanted to play them they are not easy to beat
6226017 but we created chances especially in the first half and played well but we suffered when they counter attacked and this is a problem we must work on
6226018 i can see progression i think we are moving forward
6226019 we started the match with the idea of surviving which we managed we were attacking well from the breaks
6226020 maybe if we had started the second half 1 0 up it would have been better for us but although it shook us marek jankulovsvky scored a beautiful goal from his free kick
6226021 we controlled the game for most of the second half and they did not have too many scoring chances but england are a very strong team who played right to the end and it was a shame we conceded such a late goal
6226022 for the love of money is the root of all evil
6226023 payments which are made where there is no legal liability to undp but the moral obligation justifies making such payments which are in the interest of undp
6226024 undp should be able to show compassion when addressing such cases
6226025 with the proposed amendment to its rules undp seeks to harmonize its approach with those of the other funds and programmes
6226026 undp does not expect the proposed change to result in a significant financial impact for undp over a period of time given the low number of such payments that undp has had to address to date
6226027 president mwanawasa was a true servant of the people who served this country with dignity and honor
6226028 we have lost a great leader who had a real vision for leadership and problems that face the country
6226029 has sunk into such economic difficulties that it may be likened to a sinking titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives
6226030 he was a very outstanding politician who made a great contribution to his countrys development and regional peace and development
6226031 he attached great importance to zambias relations with china and did a lot for the friendly cooperation between the two countries
6226032 the voters generally did not vote for their ideology but for change
6226033 it became a fashion a reaction to the nonperformance of other political parties
6226034 the maoists have a psychological complex that the army and police are not in their favor

6226082 we dont have any office nor do we have any full time staff
6226083 this talk of npt and ctbt being discriminatory in nature is double talk then why did we sign the wto which is also discriminatory
6226084 there is no guarantee that america will give up its nuclear weapons
6226085 there is an element of discrimination but the impact is diluted by the bargain that these nuclear weapon states would reduce their stockpile of weapons
6226086 if we dont sign the ctbt and npt but this nuclear deal goes through this will lead to arms race in the region between india and pakistan china this will lead to diversion of resources which can otherwise be used for alleviating poverty

6226110 republican presidential candidate sen john mccain appeared tuesday to suggest rationing of veterans health care may be needed so combat veterans can receive the care they deserve
6226111 we need to concentrate our efforts to handle those wounds and disabilities that are directly the result of combat
6226112 so heres my idea and its not originated with me but ive consulted with so many others who are here look we need to concentrate our efforts to handle those wounds and those disabilities that are directly the result of combat we need to expand our ability to treat ptsd ptsd is going to be tough in this war you know that and we need to treat the combat wounds we need to increase that ability to do so
6226113 these wars are the first to be waged in large numbers by a new generation of brave women but 15 percent of our women soldiers that served on the front lines who walk into a va facility screen positive for military sexual trauma is senator mccain suggesting that we cant afford to give them benefits senator mccains campaign did not return calls for comment about his statement but these are questions he must answer all veterans respect john mccains service if he too respects ours he should not be suggesting that we shortchange our soldiers with non combat injuries who have served with such honor and dignity
6226114 after touring the manchester va medical center va secretary james peake also said he is against giving veterans cards to let them receive treatment at non va facilities
6226115 the bush administration and sen john mccain for that matter initially opposed passage of the legislation which was supported overwhelmingly by both democrats and republicans mccain campaigning last week used language suggesting he supported the bill in fact mccain did not even cast a vote on the final measure for bush and mccain to try to claim credit now for a bipartisan effort they both opposed is a plain attempt to hoodwink the american voter
6226116 under the webb bill veterans would receive maximum educational benefits after 36 months of service and those benefits would be tied to the full cost of public school tuition and expenses in the veterans home state the graham bill would require 12 years of service to garner a maximum benefit of 2000 per month with increases in that figure tied to the consumer price index critics point out that the cpi has been steadily outpaced by tuition increases
6226117 my proposal and others senator graham senator burn is well place incentives for people to stay in the military
6226118 yes the more you get because we want people to stay in we have to increase the benefits for the men and women who are serving and motivate those to serve

6226239 un ambiente que parec a el de un encuentro a puerta cerrada
6226240 why when he left office he took all the records form his tenure and locked them away in a private storage unit when these records were susposed to become public record fooliani you need to be blown outta a airlock form the space station
6226241 the windows are all open they must be painting or using solvents or something
6226242 what none o you you sure i never heard of that
6226243 those men persians are the most lavish men in the world and the most careless of the morrow they cannot keep money and whatever riches fall to them they waste all in a very little time
6226244 the most commendable property of the manners of the persians is their kindness to strangers the reception and protection they afford them and their universal hospitality and toleration in regard to religion except the clergy of the country who as in all other places hate to a furious degree all those that differ from their opinions the persians are very civil and very honest in matters of religion
6226245 miss you are in the central bank of the islamic republic of iran and you expect us to illegally sign that bill dont you know its illegal to write on money
6226246 but i live abroad im going to keep this bill as a souvenir ill never spend it
6226247 after cavalera conspiracy i wanted to write a stronger uncompromised statement with soulfly what i did on this album is what i was aiming for this is the soulfly album that ive been trying to make for a long time
6226248 its definitely soulflys most battle ready record by far the vibe reminds me of movies like gladiator and 300 it comes from a completely different place
6226249 im excited to open the record with a fast song usually soulfly albums begin mid tempo but this reminds me of beneath the remains this song also has one of the biggest hooks ive ever done i can close my eyes and picture huge festival crowds singing it when the fast part comes in its just war
6226250 its the closest thing ive done to pantera dave put some killer lyrics to the music the fast part at the end is my favorite part on the album
6226251 his screaming on that song was off the wall to work with david was a trip the songs a full assault and it feels really natural its got that uncompromising attitude
6226252 usually album titles are inspired by something else like a movie
6226253 the first sketch the artist sent me was amazing it depicted this crazy guy with six arms holding six weapons each weapon represented one of our records when i got the image the word conquer just came to me
6226254 to me its not about conquering the world my statement on the record is conquering fear if you conquer your fear you conquer life and death youre truly free when you conquer your fear so thats why this name means so much
6226255 i like to mix cultures the other soulfly albums were more eastern european flavored sepultura was more brazilian egypt has a big chunk of influence on conquer we visited the city of the dead while we were in egypt its a cemetery where families still live near their dead that was crazy creepy and wild i didnt know the cairo trip was going to affect the album as much as it did
6226256 by the nile river there was this crazy gypsy band playing killer music
6226257 i happened to have my recorder so i recorded them and made an interlude out of their performance it felt so authentic to have that outro like old sepultura id rather the record sounds live than use a sound library from the internet that outro is subtle ive been making records for so long and i finally found the perfect balance between brutality and experimentation
6226258 honestly its a thank you to black sabbath for being black sabbath its slow doom metal
6226259 fedaya makes dark really heavy dub completely different from commercial dub he did the outro for touching the void and he played a lot of weird instruments those little things definitely make this song special when you listen to it
6226260 we could use the tools of the market to make a commercial record and sell more but i wouldnt be as happy inside i made the choice and we arent going down the easy road were going down the fucked up road but thats the road that we know
6226261 nearly everyone working in film in america has at some point been inspired by or worked with kaufman
6226262 he is the biggest cheerleader for independent cinema ive ever met and is responsible for helping start the careers of many top actors and writers including kevin costner marisa tomei samuel l jackson and trey parker this film is more than just a look into the bizarre life of lloyd kaufman it pays homage to his work hence the term schlock umentary like our subject we tried to not take ourselves too seriously and just have fun with it
6226263 its about time someone made a film about lloyd kaufman hes one of my favorite directors
6226264 jaeger and her team have produced a superbly tromatic edumentary hope she remembers me when she hits the big time hoorah to independent filmmakers
6226265 i do believe youre in need a pair of arms mlady
6226266 this facility like those used by other central banks has been designed in case the global credit markets deteriorate further and make cash difficult to access but the likelihood of this being needed remains extremely low
6226267 i can assure you we are well aware of the cost for people who have been unfortunately caught up in the fallout
6226268 but it is important to keep a sense of perspective
6226269 the majority of institutions accounting for over 90 per cent of household financial assets are not directly affected by these current events these institutions are well capitalised businesses and give no apparent reason for concern
6226270 our banks are navigating their way through the current turmoil well

6226276 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6226277 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6226278 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive
6226279 the businesses around this area could make things difficult for filming but they are being so cooperative
6226280 is that our red post box or is it a real one
6226281 i usually give you all one or two tone words when we have a meeting like this but if i were to give you two words this time they would be euros lyn
6226282 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6226283 my name is chris but i go by drmaniacal or just doc online my interests include gaming and art of course but i also enjoy golfing and bowling as well as going to the movies amusement parks the mall and various other places my friends decide to drag me to my family also owns a boat so fishing tubing swimming and simply riding around are some other things i like to do
6226284 in my opinion traditional art is sort of being eclipsed by the new digital media that has been developed over the past few years you see more and more professional artists producing their work with programs like photoshop and corel painter rather than traditional media such as paint and canvas i believe this is because the artist find that they have a lot more control over what they are creating and that it is easier to put amazing detail into their work with digital media than with traditional media plus certain features of photoshop and painter make painting with a tablet and the like a much quicker process than using traditional media and time is a very important aspect to pro artists everywhere
6226285 ive been drawing since i was around the age four or five when my father brought home my first pack of crayons and a massize poster sized sheet of paper he took from the newspaper company he worked for but ive only gotten serious about my art in the past year since i figured out how to paint and make cool things in photoshop and since i met raimu the guy who is now one of my best friends and who served and still serves as my art sensei so to speak hes played a major role in my developement and improvement as an artist in the past year and id like to thank him for it here
6226286 right now i own an xbox xbox 360 ps2 gamecube wii and n64 and even though i have most of the next gen newer systems right now im playing my n64 the most and revisiting my older games like mario 64 and the legend of zelda ocarina of time though i play super smash bros brawl online quite a bit as well
6226287 hmm well thats kind of tough honestly im having just as much fun with current gen games as i am with ones that date a few years back time splitters 3 future perfect for instance is a couple years old now yet i still find it nearly as entertaining as other newer shooters like halo 3 newer games have massive graphical improvements over older games of course but in my opinion gameplay is still just as fun in the older games and thats what counts
6226288 i really cant answer that for sure i know well be seeing better and better viuals in games as the years pass i have a hunch that there will be more and more mmo games like world of warcraft produced do to their popularity and im sure well be seeing new systems produced by the three major gaming companies microsoft sony and nintendo but otherwise i dont really know
6226289 well id like to improve my skills to the point that i could become a professional illustrator or concept artist and work for gaming companies or anyone else who would need the services of a good artist
6226290 ooh tough question i think im going to have to say super mario 64 though it was the first game i ever played back when i got my n64 12 years ago i believe and im still having fun with it today ive played some amazing games like smash bros brawl the halo series gears of war and the elder scrolls 4 oblivion which is a close close second to mario 64 in terms of awesome but my first game still takes the cake

6226296 ban ki moon se encuentra muy preocupado por los atentados que han sacudido a la sociedad argelina
6226297 we need to respond to the needs of the community
6226298 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
6226299 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
6226300 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
6226301 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled
6226302 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6226303 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6226304 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6226305 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6226306 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6226307 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6226308 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6226309 they want to know what were going to do about it
6226310 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
6226311 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
6226312 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
6226313 want to live a little longer get a second wife a study reported in new scientist suggests that
6226314 most women would rather have one tenth of a first rate man than all of a second rate one
6226315 i decided to find a better way to react to frivolous lawsuits than just being reactive
6226316 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6226317 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6226318 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6226319 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6226320 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6226321 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6226322 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6226323 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6226324 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6226325 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6226326 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6226327 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable
6226328 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6226329 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6226330 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive
6226331 the businesses around this area could make things difficult for filming but they are being so cooperative
6226332 is that our red post box or is it a real one

6226334 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6226335 how are you going to make my own electricity from wind power
6226336 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
6226337 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6226338 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6226339 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6226340 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6226341 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6226342 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6226343 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6226344 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6226345 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6226346 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6226347 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me
6226348 i usually dont get off when men are pounding hard on my breasts or squeezing or pinching them really hard just do it kindly and nicely to my nipples massage them im kind of sensitive underneath my boobs as well so just moving your hands back and forth under my boobs feels really good lick them but dont bite them and one of the other things is i have a hard time getting off when im on top unless the guy holds my breasts i like to grind when im riding a guys cock i like to move back and forth but the only way i can get off is if he has at least one hand on my boobs its always been like that for me unless im on the bottom in which case i can cum any way i want but when im on top i need to have that kind of sensitivity and stimulation but if he squeezes too hard i lose interest if a guy is nice to me while im riding him then i definitely cum
6226349 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6226350 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6226351 no one in salt lake is providing our la office with any information about the issue at this point
6226352 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6226353 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6226354 if anything the presence of a grandfather was associated with decreased survival of grandchildren
6226355 it doesnt surprise me that men in those societies live longer than men in monogamous societies where they become widowed and have nobody to care for them
6226356 its very difficult to date i just got kind of lucky
6226357 hes just a great guy hes awesome and really really talented
6226358 when we play amphitheaters well run up and down the stairs
6226359 and all of us all the bands bought bikes and we go mountain biking and well go to amusements parks and things like that
6226360 i had just gave cuzz the stash so he could get on his feet we all was suppose to be together i dont know what he was thinkin goin over there tho
6226361 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6226362 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6226363 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6226364 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6226365 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6226366 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6226367 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6226368 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6226369 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6226370 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
6226371 do not spare even the god fearing women wearing the hijab the veil on the head or the niqab which exposes only the eyes
6226372 the majority of the victims refuse to report the aggressions i will involve the parliament to understand why this happens
6226373 sarkozy cest le seul qui a t oblig de passer par lelys e pour devenir premier ministre
6226374 prosecutors had the burden to prove their case and they needed their witness to have a chance
6226375 i would have preferred to confront the evidence because they had a right to oppose the iraq war on a public sidewalk
6226376 i feel relieved but we shouldnt have been dragged into this by a vindictive prosecution maybe a public apology would help restore my confidence in the system
6226377 over the past few years weve been strictly conditioned to expect new judd apatow movies like celebrity duis and ryan adams albums to happen once every two or three weeks but what if we told you there were no more apatow produced films being released for the rest of the 2008 its true
6226378 if you do not see what you are looking for darenot will get it for you
6226379 the brilliant employees used an instrument located just below the cockpit window that is critical to the operation of the onboard computers
6226380 they decided this instrument the tat probe would be adequate to use as a ladder
6226381 are now doing things to our aircraft that may put our lives and the lives of our passengers at risk
6226382 anger is like drinking poison and waiting for someone else to die
6226383 university politics are so vicious precisely because the stakes are so small
6226384 the fool doth think he is wise but the wise man knows himself to be a fool
6226385 anger is like drinking poison and waiting for someone else to die
6226386 the fool doth think he is wise but the wise man knows himself to be a fool
6226387 anger is like drinking poison and waiting for someone else to die
6226388 the fool doth think he is wise but the wise man knows himself to be a fool
6226389 anger is like drinking poison and waiting for someone else to die
6226390 the fool doth think he is wise but the wise man knows himself to be a fool
6226391 its important that the elections law focus on elections not on attempting to use this legislation to solve a difficult and much more complicated problem
6226392 i was going to get back w you when i got back

6226399 this is your second warning that the factory warranty on your vehicle is about to expire
6226400 the terrorists should know that the only way for them is to give themselves up
6226401 as the president of the republic has said many times the state will unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6226402 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation chosen by the nation and which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the national territory
6226403 sincere condolences to the families who lost loved ones and to the people of algeria
6226404 these criminals and thugs must be stopped and the united states will continue working with algeria in close cooperation on counterterrorism measures
6226405 the uk united kingdom government fully supports the government of algeria in its fight against terrorism and condemns the attacks that have taken place in algeria in the last two days
6226406 if force com were to become the de facto web platform we would look for an acceleration in total applications offered
6226407 we hope to see foreign professionals being allowed to practice here
6226408 and then we wish to be able to own land
6226409 these restrictions are viewed as a significant factor in the philippines poor record of attracting foreign investment relative to neighboring economies waivers are not available under the negative list
6226410 theres no doubt that those are the factors that are driving parental choices around which schools to attend
6226411 but i think the people of canberra certainly have a right to know where the person who would be the chief minister of the act stands on this and a range of other issues
6226412 we havent had an opportunity to learn or understand what his personal values or philosophies are on issues that are very important to the community
6226413 i think its important for mr seselja to state clearly and unequivocally where he stands
6226414 my position is that i dont see re criminalisation of abortion as something that i would support
6226415 this is one of those deals that we need to listen to the stake holders
6226416 its just one of those things thats been sitting there and we want to get it a little more orderly
6226417 were just in a state of limbo were not in heaven and were not in hell were just stuck
6226418 neither cerritos nor la palma came it was cypress another time long beach police came to our house for an emergency
6226419 when youre in an urgent situation and you need utilities or paramedics or the police people tell you no you dont live in los angeles you live in orange county
6226420 bridgestones participation in 200 formula one races shows the level of commitment we have given to the sport and we are delighted to be working with all of the teams and so many major motor manufacturers in our current position as official tyre supplier participating in a major sport brings us many benefits and in return we hope we have helped the sport grow just as we have grown through being part of formula one
6226421 thats a good proposal but the question is who will pay for it will it really stop the growing incidents of heinous crimes being committed by filipino workers abroad
6226422 the only defense that we put up is to plead insanity whenever these ofws are found guilty of heinous crimes perhaps there is a way to address this problem and one of these is to determine their overall fitness because workers particularly domestic helpers are exposed to abuse so we have to really prepare them
6226423 the problem is do we have enough psychiatrists to conduct the tests considering the big number of departing workers does the department of health have enough psychiatrists it might be an additional burden both to recruiters and the applicants so we have to study this seriously
6226424 eu venho treinando para fazer o melhor aqui acho que com 17 90 m sua melhor marca que atingiu em 2007 d p dio

6226431 we do know of several bugs that were working on for release in a month or two i would imagine these will fix your issues dont worry this will get resolved soon
6226432 one of the men ran towards the third security guard who was positioned across the road adjacent to the getaway car raised his firearm at the guard and the guard in self defence fired one shot
6226433 i heard the first shot then after one second i heard a second shot i went to the front of the shop and saw the security guard with the gun out
6226434 he was good man he was the best guy in the world
6226435 everybody is so upset its a shock to all of us but thats part of life
6226436 i understand the department of defence has some specialist equipment at its disposal namely a fuel bladder which could be used to transport the orphaned whale calf in sydneys pittwater
6226437 i would be grateful for urgent advice as to whether the department of defence could make this equipment available as a priority to the nsw national parks and wildlife service for this purpose
6226438 colins physical health is deteriorating we will have to be guided by the experts as to whether his health is up to a further attempt at getting him out to open water and if not what the best option is
6226439 there wont be a last show or anything silly like that
6226440 but im sure someone will probably convince us to do some kind of reunion thing round about 2030 at which point hopefully some of you will be there to push me out on to the stage at the cantab in my giant rolling throne a la brother solomon burke
6226441 if force com were to become the de facto web platform we would look for an acceleration in total applications offered
6226442 there is no doubt that the decline in oil prices is good news from a margin supporting standpoint as well as helping put at least a tentative floor under consumer confidence levels
6226443 we also know that canadian gdp contracted in the first quarter with little bounce in the second quarter
6226444 this heavy reliance on the global economy in turn leaves the earnings outlook more vulnerable to shifts in economic conditions than ever before
6226445 its a possibility that corporate profits could decline another 25 30 from here
6226446 rimm will not push out this device without resolving such issues via software patch or at amp t resolution
6226447 better fundamentals will continue to face off against macro headwinds tangible challenges from slower housing turns are likely peaking but recurring concerns about the fundamental health of the mortgage market perhaps overdone but still uncertain loom large in investors minds
6226448 offer further evidence of stabilizing trends in the home retail sector

6226484 like a number of countries we do have reservations about aspects of the content of the draft exemption recently circulated
6226485 our experience has been and its drawn principally from iraq that when you are in an area for a while people will eventually come to trust you they rely on your security they will give you intelligence and expect you to continue to provide that security
6226486 what happens when you come back is that theres not a level of trustworthiness that youve had there among the people because you did this once before
6226487 when we leave they will either go back to being farmers or will be killed

6226494 a senior vet from taronga zoo examined the whale last night and while the whale is not distressed his condition has deteriorated as he hasnt fed in days
6226495 the plan today is to use an inflatable sling to try to get the whale further out to sea where he might hook up with another pod of whales
6226496 previously the whale was lured out to sea by following a yacht that it thought was its mother but then it turned around and came back in because i think it was still attached to the yacht
6226497 if we can get it into the sling we can get it further out to the ocean into deeper water and hopefully closer to another pod of whales

6226506 do you know for the past eight years ive been telling myself one thing
6226507 i think im tired of waiting for it to get better
6226508 i cant wait anymore god i dont even know what im waiting for but by this time its pretty obvious it isnt coming dont you think
6226509 why just just tell me why you wont look at me why do you continue to avoid my eyes why
6226510 what is it that you wont tell me why cant you no
6226511 dont say there isnt anything i i know there is just tell me please

6226513 god i wouldnt be able to survive without you i cant i know it
6226514 go on dear sir and open it i assure you it will do you no harm not in this moment at least
6226515 it bears you no harm no ill will not in the first page nor in the second nay not even in the third or fourth in that respect you remain safe and unaffected sure and steady and unharmed but do not sir let yourself be deceived for once you are past the beginning you become food for one and all the sentences will swallow you whole the insinuations will drown you with their sheer overwhelming presence and intricacies which you could not begin to wade safely through the paragraphs would trip you up the punctuation give you an headache and heartache that will not allow themselves to be either dissipated ignored or forgotten the space the empty space would kill you and stop your heart for unending seconds and spaces in time if you can ignore the words within the words i am quite certain sir that you would survive the encounter but if you are possessed of a second sight a deeper probe the knowledge this book would provide you with would be the worst most dizzying of insights imaginable you would be left on dry land after one of the longest deepest farthest darkest swims in the ocean of this book you would be bruised battered weak encrusted with salt and tears and sweat for you would have experienced pain and the fear of having been overwhelmed by a greater power deep and undeniable sadness and you would be exhausted by it all but you would mend in time you would recover and it will be all the easier and swifter because i will not be there to cause you further anguish thus
6226516 your troubles will end once you have embraced them your freedom will come after you have allowed yourself to be chained and strung along and lead into the worst of all places can you accept this will you read
6226517 i will not read it because i would rather read you
6226518 you forget sir that i did not give you options
6226519 you did not work so hard just to throw it away i know that and so do you you may not have allowed yourself to acknowledge the hope you held but hold it you did perhaps you did not wish to recognize the chance for fear of the rejection of being thwarted you wished to protect yourself and you still do though you have seemingly made yourself vulnerable by what you just offered the true hope lay not in fulfillment of your proposal but in the recognition of your efforts to stay strong in the acceptance to the face of what you believe you cannot give the allowance of your affected and indeed imagined inadequacies you may not have wanted this to happen even while you still did but here i am madam i refuse your offer and i accept your request i will jump into that abyss plunge into that blackness but i will not do so alone i refuse to that is my condition and i demand that you accept it
6226520 you are not in the position to make conditions of me
6226521 oh but i am madam and i do come with me let us take this journey together you and i alone
6226522 i am obliged to decline your proposal sir please forgive me
6226523 just read it please read and you will understand it will not hurt so much anymore it will not pain you for long not once you have understood it is all in there keep it close to your heart and then discard it if you expect to mend you must forget me let me go once i am gone
6226524 it is okay now for you have reached the surface and you will heal and live and survive for i am dead now in every sense of the word you will not waste your life loving someone who is incapable of the very institution

6226574 the commander in chief must always listen to the commanders and not the latest opinion polls
6226575 americas future leaders must remember that the war on terror will be won on the offense and thats where our military must stay
6226576 you live by a code and you fight for a cause and im honored to be your commander in chief
6226577 cannot be won however if we treat terrorism primarily as a matter of law enforcement law enforcement is an essential part of our strategy but our strategy cannot be limited to law enforcement alone

6226591 has started a sustained and hard hitting advertising campaign against senator john mccain in states that will be vital this fall painting mr mccain in a series of commercials as disconnected from the economic struggles of the middle class
6226592 begun the drive with little fanfare often eschewing the modern campaign technique of unveiling new spots for the news media before they run in an effort to win added free attention
6226593 if you can go quietly negative thats what hes done
6226594 i think the perception is that hes still running the positive campaign its a pretty smart high low good cop bad cop strategy
6226595 draw s a connection between republican john mccains decision not to call ralph reed before a senate panel and reeds involvement in an atlanta fund raiser this week
6226596 s potlights john mccains role in helping pave the way for foreign owned dhl to take over an american shipping company and put more than 8 200 jobs at risk in wilmington ohio
6226597 ads from the afl cio and the obama campaign claim that mccain is partly to blame for the loss of more than 8 000 jobs in ohio they paint a false picture
6226598 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
6226599 an obama ad uses dated and out of context quotes to portray mccain as clueless on the economy
6226600 return s to the core of mccains weakness the economy and bush the ad also constructs a narrative that in a sense accuses the iraqis of bilking americans with high oil prices
6226601 addresses the numerous ways in which the special interests in washington have embraced john mccain and how mccain has hugged right back employing lobbyists in top positions and giving tax breaks to oil and drug companies instead of working to ease the burden on middle class families
6226602 highlights john mccains continued support for storing nuclear waste at yucca mountain despite scientific evidence that raises serious questions about its safety
6226603 mccain is not proposing new tax breaks specifically targeted to the oil industry hes proposing a general reduction in the corporate income tax rate which democrats figure would benefit the five largest oil and gas companies by 3 8 billion

6226687 its unclear whether weve hit the bottom of the economys downward spiral so the responsible approach is to change our spending now and hold on to our savings as long as we can

6226859 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6226860 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6226861 it could be something like a convertible preferred deal that might end up diluting shareholders but at the same time the rest of the capital structure winds up doing ok
6226862 the market sees that takeover as further illustrating the guarantee of the government
6226863 what mudd didnt say is that the company is too leveraged to a depreciating asset housing and losses are off the charts and there are no signs of stability
6226864 that delay will only be possible if the gses continue to be able to sell discount notes and term debt at relatively stable spreads
6226865 a lot of profits for defense contractors but no real addition to u s security

6226876 i am unapologetic i dont write about things unless theyre true im a grown a woman and ive experienced grown a things
6226877 im impressed with our whole rookie group jacob is a good football player the best thing that happened for us is jacob played mike tolbert played at fullback and both of them had mental errors where they did not block the guy they were supposed to block and we took sacks on back to back plays one of them was a walk in touchdown where we missed a block they other one was going to be a real competitive chance for a touchdown pass and mike tolbert took his eyes off his guy and missed it thats what im talking about the fact that theyre getting the snaps theyre getting right now theyre going to be playing in our games the fact that theyre getting those snaps right now hopefully will eliminate a couple of those errors because when they know what to do and they do the right thing theyre both very good football players
6226878 i am confident that chancellor stafford and ms mcmullen will serve with honor and distinction as they fill these two important posts i appreciate the experience and skill each brings to their respective appointments and i am very pleased they have agreed to serve the state of tennessees appellate courts
6226879 i also want to honor the late judge crawford he left behind a legacy of honesty and integrity after serving on the court of appeals for 26 years and he will be deeply missed by all those who worked with him throughout his distinguished career
6226880 i have continually worked to improve the judicial system and to make myself a better judge
6226881 it is my hope to be able to apply that knowledge and experience as an appellate judge i appreciate governor bredesens confidence in me and look forward to serving in this position
6226882 any time an industry is opened up to allow for more competition it is the consumers who get the greatest benefit this is no exception and it will prove beneficial to people across the state by giving them more options
6226883 absolutely as a songwriter it presented a lot of interesting challenges and as a musician i got to exercise my chops on guitar piano string arrangements bass programming drums producing and putting it out on my own label it was like an all round arts project that came together for me like a composers way of making a rock record
6226884 well i was originally thinking of naming the record that but i thought it might not make it into any retail stores so when it was time to come up with a name for the band i thought serj and the flying cunts of chaos just for fun to be honest we had two or three different names i ran them by the guys in the band and overwhelmingly everyone liked the cunts so
6226885 we set up a website electthedead com to get signatures on electoral reform points that i came up with im working with axis of justice and building coalitions between different democratic organisations like registertovote org moveon org declareyourself com and progressive org to get signatures its building by the thousands all the time once we have a decent number of signatories we want to take it to certain members of congress and see if we can make it into a resolution or a number of resolutions
6226886 most artists make their points from an intuitive emotional point of view rather than a political logical point of view and thats what we should be doing i have much respect for that
6226887 i had an article called understanding oil appear on our website on september 12th 2001 i got death threats radio station program directors were dropping our single chop suey at the time all over the airwaves in the us people were telling me to get the fuck out of the country if i dont like america all sorts of fun stuff a lot of reactionism prevailed in the us at the time and people werent ready to listen to logical explanations of the after effects of our oil policy in the last 100 years in the middle east so yeah ive had my share but hers is nicer i like that better id rather be condemned by a whole government for having emotions i want to join her
6226888 we havent decided if the future contains system or not

6226891 the closest thing to a hero in the struggle to implement
6226892 implement a plan to provide for safe and affordable distribution
6226893 by simply being here you have demonstrated an interest in government and an ability to engage in the political process when you leave here the challenge for you is to continue your adventure into public service
6226894 i encourage you to spend time in the coming months and years thinking about how you might best serve your community state and country
6226895 we can see the youngest one the 11 year old at the gun store taking guns

6226900 the chinese crowd knows a lot about diving and they love diving it is one of their nations biggest sports so they are very interesting and they really love their chinese divers but the great part is they respect the divers from other countries and when they do hard dives or when they do really good dives they will cheer you on as well so it is definitely a good atmosphere
6226901 they will probably have a lot of pressure i am sure some of them might crack a little bit under it but you are going to see a lot of them hold up to it as well so it will be interesting to watch what happens but i think that is also a good opportunity for us to go in there and try to put pressure on them and dive really well and kind of see where they fall
6226902 for me the easiest i think would be shooting it is something that i have done well at and was able to just pick up pretty easily and then the most difficult is fencing because it is a combat sport you are going against somebody i have fenced for five years but if i am going against somebody who has fenced for 15 years they are going to have a little bit more experience so a little bit more of an advantage
6226903 i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics

6226907 too many tennesseans die each year from preventable tobacco related illnesses
6226908 i believe every citizen deserves the right to go to work earn a paycheck eat a meal and provide for their families without risking their health in the process the initiatives we passed last year represented the biggest step any tobacco state has taken to reduce the toll of tobacco on the health and lives of its citizens and it will ultimately mean healthier living for all the people of tennessee

6226975 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

6226978 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6226979 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war

6227026 we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6227027 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6227028 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6227029 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6227030 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable

6227040 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6227041 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6227042 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems

6227051 and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see people enjoying themselves having a good time and he recognized the responsibility of seizing the moment and he did it
6227052 i told myself if im going to get this record its going to be here because the track is really fast
6227053 i told myself im going to go out there and give it my all and i went out there and just left everything on the track

6227069 the dvd is starting to come together and will consist of two separate discs one will be the live show from our last tour and the other one will be a documentary following the band on the 2005 tour which marked the end of that line up the fact that the band has seen such major changes the last two years made it very difficult emotionally to invest time and energy in this product and it wasnt until the documentary draft was proposed by per hillblom that i started to see what this dvd was trying to communicate we still have a few commentary tracks to record but we are starting to see the end of it
6227070 we are starting to get a grasp of the tons of material that i have been working on in my head
6227071 our thanks to the u s small business administration for acting quickly on my request to get riverwalk residents the help they need to recover

6227082 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6227083 this study demonstrates the potential for personalized medicine combining selection of patients with a specific type of genetic mutation and a drug treatment that has been specifically designed to overcome that mutation
6227084 the publication of these ground breaking results in the lancet offers new hope to those patients with cf due to a nonsense mutation in the cftr gene and establishes a path forward for evaluating the efficacy and long term safety of ptc124
6227085 we are very pleased by this positive outcome from our ongoing collaboration with ptc
6227086 the development of ptc124 fits well with our strategic goal of supporting approaches that have the potential to modify the course of cf we are continuing to work together with ptc and the broader cf medical community to support the next steps in the evaluation of ptc124 for the clinical benefit for the treatment of nonsense mutation cf
6227087 the publication of these data provides clinical proof of concept in cf for the ptc124 mechanism of action in overcoming nonsense mutations as the basis for treating genetic disease
6227088 based on these results we intend to initiate a phase 2b study later this year to evaluate the clinical benefit of ptc124 in adults and children with nonsense mutation mediated cf given the potential applicability of ptc124 to multiple genetic disorders we have a pivotal study of ptc124 for nonsense mutation duchenne becker muscular dystrophy ongoing and are planning proof of concept studies in additional genetic disorders
6227089 effectiveness of ptc124 treatment of cystic fibrosis caused by nonsense mutations a prospective phase ii trial

6227092 its clear to us that the olympics have been a watershed moment for mobile media
6227093 the time sensitive nature of the olympics and the around the clock schedule of events have led many mobile consumers to view their phones as the place to stay connected
6227094 we argue that weve already hit a critical mass of audience and with the olympics that audience is only going to get bigger i think we will see impressive numbers for mobile consumption with the olympics
6227095 consumers are really just looking for that olympic snack on their phone
6227096 we know that people are using the phone to look at the tv schedule to look at the medal counts to look at highlights photos of the day and consumers are even looking at athlete info on their phones and are just reading up a little bit on the athletes and really surrounding themselves with contextual data from the olympics that get them pumped up for watching the events live in the evening
6227097 sip entertainment where you are just sipping little bit here and there
6227098 you want to check in and see how many medals your country is getting or see highlights of the latest michael phelps swim and i think that it makes sense
6227099 youre not going to watch it for three hours in your living room with your significant other with a bowl of popcorn
6227100 we shouldnt have to pay for it if we have to sit through commercials but if the commercials are taken out and its reasonable i think canadians are willing to pay for it if its not going to go over their cellphone data plan
6227101 maybe in the future when you buy a digital package you will pay a little more a month for mobile access
6227102 polished well beyond what they were on the 360 and ps3
6227103 ah yes sir thats her there i just need you to sign this and shes all yours
6227104 yes it took me awhile to find out where they had her at but at least she was on a morning flight otherwise we might have not made it out of the airport
6227105 everyone is in the layout room right now ryan and eric are probably at eachothers throats by now

6227123 we ided the db as stephanie taylor but the murder weapon was not found
6227124 mr lawter where is the knife that was used to kill stephanie
6227125 i dont know i came home and found her on the floor dead
6227126 i thought that maybe they had come back i didnt do anything wrong
6227127 you shot one of my officers that is attempted murder my friend
6227128 i think you should do a little backgroung check on your new pet
6227129 yelina i need a favor can you find me information on a rapter named daku okay thank you
6227130 well lawters gun isnt his its registered to a joshua chase

6227133 lets get going we have been here for three hours try at least to get home before dark
6227134 yelina come in she wont hurt you daku let her in please
6227135 we believe this highlights the political risk that exists in macau as the government has indicated it plans to keep growth in macau under control
6227136 i think when you look at the way the stock trades any little change changes the stock 8 percent 10 percent its pretty amazing swings
6227137 theres a lot of people making bets on pieces of news that come out volatile that certainly is the case
6227138 most of these visa restrictions are aimed at quite frankly bringing higher quality visitors to macau from further away
6227139 so youre not clogging up the border gates with folks that are day trip visitors or people that are coming there to hang out
6227140 the idea of slow or negative growth in the first half of 2009 is not new and thus should not be a surprise that causes gaming stocks to plummet
6227141 why dont you go to bridal row in new westminster the entire street is lined with bridal shops on both sides
6227142 wait a second how come i was the one who was trying to please her and not the other way around
6227143 womans right to choose in the case of democrats and in either case without exception
6227144 if they have candy in their hair and were trying to comb it they think its us whos hurting them
6227145 it depends on the kid though some kids ive had really like getting their hair washed
6227146 siblings too they always want to be like their big brother or sister
6227147 it tough with kids they wiggle a lot and we end up cutting ourselves sometimes
6227148 but ive even gone out to the parking lot and sat on the curb to cut a kids hair whatevers going to make them happy
6227149 not quite a museum but more than a surf shop
6227150 i hate it for joe gibbs and j d gibbs that they were put in that situation by their team
6227151 we take everything pretty serious when were trying to do a postrace inspection and evaluate things that have implications long term we really feel like we need to get everybody to give us a fair shot at that
6227152 youve seen our penalties escalate through the last year or more with taking more than one person out in this particular case crew chiefs and car chiefs were suspended and we feel because of the situation relative to engines we felt like the engine tuner probably had something to do with it
6227153 and also the seventh man suspended was a mechanic identified as someone who did it
6227154 it just gives us a flexibility on the time how long it needs to be
6227155 when we do these tests whether it be dyno tests there was a time when we went to the wind tunnel quite a bit and other things that we do to evaluate the competition in the garage area we take that very very serious
6227156 i cant tell you how serious we take it its serious because were trying to give everybody a fair chance
6227157 these are the days of remote controlled state of the art toys
6227158 it is hard to describe the pride i had in the company and the overwhelming thanks of the soldiers
6227159 were very proud of our employees and their involvement in the support of the troops
6227160 the people and the management are outstanding and truly make working here enjoyable
6227161 i have been provided the opportunity to make a difference in the operation direction and success of the company
6227162 i think its pretty simple certainly its a tremendous sacrifice for the national guard and the disruption that they have in their life to go and fight for our freedom
6227163 theyre sacrificing so much we can sacrifice just a little to support them
6227164 were going to have to see whether or not that is the beginning of a true withdrawal
6227165 the behavior of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia from the principles of cooperation among nations of the communities of states
6227166 it is not an act of the united states or the european union or anyone else to isolate russia it is what russia is doing
6227167 i apologize with great remorse for the actions that i took after the michigan race last saturday afternoon
6227168 my apology is extended to nascar the nascar officials joe and j d gibbs our drivers all of jgrs sponsors and especially to all of the jgr family members that i have misrepresented
6227169 joe and j d gibbs trust me to lead this race team with honesty and integrity i have failed them and feel great remorse for doing so i accept the penalties imposed by nascar and joe gibbs racing and make no excuses
6227170 first and foremost i would like to apologize to the employees and partners of joe gibbs racing
6227171 because of poor decision making i have failed you as the leader of this team and i am solely responsible for this situation add comment
6227172 my decision to step down should not come as a surprise to anyone given that im now 85 years old
6227173 my family has been investors in and board members of gray or its predecessors since the founding of kwtx tv in waco texas in 1951 and i look forward to continuing and building on that commitment going forward

6227177 one of the most common situations for young children to experience anxiety comes at the transition period between leaving home and attending childcare or school
6227178 sometimes the excitement that going back to school stirs up is enough to get kids up and at em for the first few days back but eventually the novelty wears off
6227179 re establishing a schools back in session bed time and morning routine a week or two in advance will pay off in the long run
6227180 even kids that love school can feel a bit apprehensive about the first big day back
6227181 to help ease the first day jitters kids can check the class list postings to see which teacher theyll have and if any friends will be joining them in their new homeroom
6227182 both of these scenarios present a great opportunity to teach your child how to deal with disappointment making new friends and facing a challenge
6227183 sharing personal stories about your own experiences especially if they have happy endings will help your child feel supported by you and help them see these dilemmas in a new light
6227184 apprehension and anxiety about school will typically pass after your child develops a comfortable routine
6227185 many schools and teachers send a list home in the first few days of school so it may pay to hold off until youve heard from them
6227186 in the meantime stick to the basics a few fun pencils erasers and highlighters should do it
6227187 after representing my country and competing in the olympics hilton gave me another great reason to get back in the pool
6227188 by being a part of this campaign im able to help support swim education programs across the nation and give young people the chance to experience the power of the sport swimming is much more than a fun activity and great form of exercise it teaches self discipline and dedication two important qualities that one can draw on to succeed both in and out of the pool
6227189 the olympic games provide an unparalleled opportunity to inspire young people across america and throughout the world
6227190 through each of the 6 250 laps swum during this relay hilton shared the olympic spirit with our guests swimming fans and athletes we hope our support of usa swimming and swim education programs will continue to make a positive impact on the communities we serve
6227191 the hilton swim to beijing relay helps our efforts to reach children in communities across the us and provide them the opportunity to learn to swim
6227192 we value the commitment that hilton has made as we continue to use the sport of swimming to keep kids across the nation healthy and safe

6227202 i can bring fitness to them so they dont have to go out of their way and we really try to make it realistic in their lives
6227203 its like mind numbing fatigue and so you couldnt work out as long and you were always sick all the time
6227204 being able to come here and modify make it work with the belly is going to be a big benefit
6227205 being with tatum and having her guide us it teaches us that great middle ground which you can pass on to your family
6227206 this is probably the most physically demanding thing a woman will ever do in her life and so its important to be well trained for it
6227207 we strongly hope that benedict xvi will make a trip to china
6227208 relations with the vatican are constantly improving we can say that there are big developments
6227209 jackson fish market does it again with another beautifully useless app
6227210 sub sector industries that latinvest and inside track operate in
6227211 we made sure that visitors could arrive and depart from sydney without any fuss
6227212 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
6227213 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
6227214 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law
6227215 for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
6227216 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think
6227217 he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
6227218 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
6227219 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
6227220 a very right wing parishioner came and was offended by some of the artwork in the church including some indigenous art and an image of a praying monk which they mistook as a buddha
6227221 that person took photos and sent them to rome and rome wrote to the bishop
6227222 the key question is whether st marys is in communion with the roman catholic church or not
6227223 its feared it may have been picked up with the other blankets
6227224 its an accident that has occurred and i have to say the teachers and principal at the school have all been supportive and have done so much to try and find it
6227225 we are all genuinely upset because she put so much hard work into that design
6227226 must be told what exactly our soldiers are doing in afghanistan and how long they will be doing it for
6227227 we didnt have any more ammunition to defend ourselves except our famas assault rifles
6227228 there were snipers among the taleban who were more numerous than us and were lying in wait we could hear them reloading
6227229 i have seen among you some people crying i understand
6227230 i share your pain and these are not just words the best way of remaining faithful to your comrades is to continue the work i dont have any doubt that we have to be here the worlds freedom is at stake here this is where the fight against terrorism is being waged
6227231 we are with the afghans so as not to leave them alone in the face of barbarity
6227232 stop sending children to be killed in an organsied firing range
6227233 the question is not about whether to fight terrorism and fundamentalism but whether the strategy is right
6227234 the objectives may be just but is the strategy the right one
6227235 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for their survival and integrity
6227236 tell my master esau this a message from your servant jacob ive been staying with laban and couldnt get away until now
6227237 we talked to your brother esau and hes on his way to meet you but he has four hundred men with him
6227238 if esau comes on the first camp and attacks it the other camp has a chance to get away
6227239 god of my father abraham god of my father isaac god who told me go back to your parents homeland and ill treat you well
6227240 go ahead of me and keep a healthy space between each herd
6227241 i will soften him up with the succession of gifts then when he sees me face to face maybe hell be glad to welcome me
6227242 sick of his manipulations jacob fled laban only to encounter his long lost and embittered brother esau the consummate deal maker jacob concocted a bribe and sent a caravan of gifts along with his women and children across the river jabbok perhaps that would pacify his brothers murderous threats physically exhausted and deeply anxious about esau alone in the desert wilderness shorn of all his considerable worldly possessions powerless to control his fate
6227243 but no longer your name is no longer jacob from now on its israel god wrestler youve wrestled with god and youve come through
6227244 come through hardly im helpless before you i am not enough
6227245 i saw god face to face and lived to tell the story
6227246 magnificent defeat of the human soul at the hands of god
6227247 if in the end we too are to become true he confronts in himself the things that are wounding him admits his limitations accepts his situation rejoins the world and moves on
6227248 basically if i cant find an indian woman ill take a black woman which ive had before but what the hey i need to get laid
6227249 you seem smart the kind of intelligent woman who doesnt want to see the yankees lose 15 2 or 2 1 or whatever hey well clearly both be free after the regular season ends see you then
6227250 it seems that steven purcell and michael cook have been impressed by the backing for the strike and the arguments about the levels of inflation but they need to come back to the unions with clear proposals to address the impact of rising prices on our members if there is no movement then we will have to look to further action in the near future
6227251 this is a window of opportunity for the employers the public recognise the dilemma our members are in
6227252 they are dedicated and dont want this disruption but have no choice this could escalate in the next few weeks and its fair to say were gearing up for that
6227253 employers dont seem prepared to talk no matter what they say
6227254 we met on august 11 and things seemed positive but then went cold thats why i think they wanted this to happen to gauge the reaction and strength of feeling we could see more in two to three weeks
6227255 the unions have got to realise that we have no more money from central government we need to get around the table
6227256 one thing the unions are unhappy about is the three year deal which they say is a non runner we understand where theyre coming from and there may now be a way of finding some common ground
6227257 it is for the unions and local authorities to resolve this dispute and avoid further disruption to public services
6227258 this is a window of opportunity for the employers the public recognise the dilemma our members are in quote i dont recognise the members dilemma just wish my pension was going to increase by more than 75p
6227259 this is a window of opportunity for the employers the public recognise the dilemma our members are in
6227260 the rivers of the murray darling basin bring life wherever they flow from outback queensland to the murray mouth from the snowy mountains to flat mallee plains
6227261 bishops of the murray darling basin acknowledge the enormous amount of community work already done in addressing the issues but we believe that many more australians need to become involved
6227262 bishops who live and work in the basin would like to add their voices in support of the rivers and all those working to save them and reflect on the murray darling basin from the perspective of christian faith
6227263 we see its life giving waters as a precious gift of god for the common good we see human beings as responsible before god for the well being of the river system
6227264 we are called to live more sustainably and grow in ecological wisdom and practice so that the generations to follow inherit a healthy and bountiful basin as intended by god
6227265 i dont want to say there is a magic solution here
6227266 sebulan lalu dapat kabar dirawat di rscm itu yang bikin saya menyesal banget
6227267 i feel this is more a class of personal anecdotes than facts the general studies students go on and on with absolutely no gain in conversation
6227268 i just kind of wish that this class wasnt taken over by people who already have so much experience working in various science technology industries and who know an ungodly amount about these topics we are half the time left in a daze somewhere between annoyed and bored out of our minds by their useless rambles and obscure vocabulary
6227269 in the current environment it is hard to find any specific triggers for these moves
6227270 i think were seeing consolidation but personally i think that theres scope for a rebound in the aussie dollar
6227271 the us dollar is consolidating after what we saw in the last couple of weeks which were fairly dramatic moves
6227272 we think this pullback is going to happen eventually in the short term however the overall sentiment remains us dollar positive

6227309 there are very few drugs with strong evidence of effectiveness in treating trigeminal neuralgia
6227310 if people fail to respond to these drugs physicians should not be reluctant to consider referring the patient for surgery often surgery is considered a last resort and patients suffer while the well intentioned physician tries other medications with limited effectiveness
6227311 if patients dont respond well to carbamazepine or one or two other drugs it is reasonable to consider surgery that targets the root of the trigeminal nerve
6227312 people with trigeminal neuralgia should be aware of the availability of surgical treatments and discuss these options with their physicians

6227367 government is at a stand little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago
6227368 our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington d c but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want
6227369 and what we want by and large is this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods we want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be and we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced at the end of the month or the end of the fiscal year
6227370 one of the ways we avoid confronting our refusal to balance the books is to rely increasingly on the projection of american military power around the world to try to maintain this dysfunctional system or set of arrangements that have evolved over the last 30 or 40 years
6227371 i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat compromised our freedom of action how every president from richard nixon down declared were going to fix the problem but none of them did
6227372 the clearest statement of what i value is found in the preamble to the constitution there is nothing in the preamble to the constitution which defines the purpose of the united states of america as remaking the world in our image which i view as a fools errand
6227373 i believe that the framers of the constitution were primarily concerned with focusing on the way we live here the way we order our affairs
6227374 and that future generations would also be able to share in those same opportunities with the current crisis in american foreign policy unless we do change our ways the likelihood that our children our grandchildren the next generation is going to enjoy the opportunities that weve had is very slight because were squandering our power we are squandering our wealth
6227375 the congress especially with regard to matters related to national security policy has thrust power and authority to the executive branch we have created an imperial presidency the congress no longer is able to articulate a vision of what is the common good the congress exists primarily to ensure the reelection of members of congress
6227376 has made our democracy a false one were going through the motions of a democratic political system but the fabric of democracy i think really has worn very thin
6227377 was a fundamental mistake it never should have been undertaken and were never going to do this kind of thing again
6227378 be the moment when we look ourselves in the mirror and see what we have become and perhaps undertake an effort to make those changes in the american way of life that will enable us to preserve for future generations that which we value most about the american way of life

6227398 unfortunately a close inspection of obamas proposals reveals something disquieting he would raise marginal tax rates for many middle income taxpayers a bad move for anyone seeking to promote economic growth
6227399 the key point that brill and viard neglect to note or discuss is that even in their cherry picked example higher marginal tax rates bring along offsetting benefits to families with lower and middle incomes
6227400 virtually the whole government debt story is due to projections of exploding health care costs

6227417 many consumers already have home networks and more than one computer
6227418 dlna makes adding devices to the home network an easy scenario
6227419 if its push button easy thats the way to go
6227420 the problem is when you go to pull information from a new device the firewall prevents it
6227421 were a long way off from commercial success but some of the pieces are falling into place
6227422 were certainly entitled to this information this is an issue of fairness to shareholders management needs to get off its lofty perch
6227423 a couple of years ago it was all hype but now we are starting to see devices that actually work
6227424 most people dont have wires running everywhere in the house
6227425 we are only starting to see this explosion of devices
6227426 i am willing to stretch myself financially to obtain the best opportunity for the future

6227429 i predicted new orleans would come back as a stronger and better city we helped deliver 126 billion in taxpayer money
6227430 who would have thought three years after the storm the president could come and say new orleans la
6227431 why did no one run over to help him in an emergency maybe his life could have been saved
6227432 peoples lives are being lost but sometimes i wonder if anyone cares if another mexican immigrant dies
6227433 you see people crouching underneath tractors when you go out in the fields we think workers should be able to rest with dignity
6227434 if somebody doesnt have shade up and available for workers this summer theyre going to get a whooping
6227435 collections has been a problem historically and we need to fix it i cant sugar coat it
6227436 people have been dying all along every year for decades and now that were finally focusing on it were finding all these heat fatalities were doing all we can with the very limited resources we have
6227437 unscrupulous employers can game the system by filing frivolous appeals
6227438 we cannot expect our workers to endure a lengthy series of appeals especially when people have actually died from these conditions
6227439 is the purpose of cal osha to induce compliance and protect workers or is the purpose to collect fine money from employers
6227440 encouraging employers to settle gets the hazards abated more quickly and gets employees protected more quickly
6227441 i completely understand that cal osha is overworked and understaffed but whats offensive is that the agency is reducing fines with no justification
6227442 in some cases companies are paying pennies on the dollar from the original fine imposed
6227443 in the end not many students got charged so what was the point
6227444 why target san diego state im sure this stuff happens in the ivy league too

6227446 it really was only a small number of kids involved but regardless drugs are a scourge in the community

6227449 that is all i have to report guys i have not another single thing i can tell you
6227450 i think its probably down between evan bayh and senator biden
6227451 and i know john mccain his seriousness his love of country hell select the person who is best and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6227452 if john mccain goes with his gut and picks joe lieberman itll be a gamechanger and in a positive way
6227453 itll send a message that he is the real centrist in this race
6227454 and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms
6227455 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6227456 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6227457 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6227458 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6227459 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6227460 we have been deeply troubled by the lack of responsiveness by some federal and state appraiser regulators in carrying out the law
6227461 we hope this article proves to be a catalyst for modernizing the existing appraisal regulatory structure and making it more effective
6227462 while some state appraisal boards do a good job of enforcement for whatever reason whether it be lack of funding or lack of mandatory licensing requirements more than a few do a poor job
6227463 from the day schumers letter was made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable
6227464 it was one of those days when i had nothing but the bullpen came in and shut them down
6227465 all that matters if i pitch five innings and have nothing is that the bullpen comes in and gets a win
6227466 they were trying their best to give the game to us
6227467 we didnt come up with a big hit when we needed one particularly in the eighth inning
6227468 it sure was a big spot it turned things around a little bit
6227469 all year long weve been saying we are ready for the next step and now we know it
6227470 i think he would do for senator obama what lyndon johnson did for john kennedy hes got serious foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that senator obama has right now who can go toe to toe with any republican on any issue at any time
6227471 not something that lends itself to on the job training

6227732 se come scriveva henri bergson la ragion dessere della democrazia la fraternit occorre altres ammettere con lui che la democrazia per essenza evangelica ne scaturisce che nostro dovere offrire alla democrazia il contributo della nostra filosofia della nostra morale della nostra tradizione un contributo certamente molteplice e vario contraddistinto per dal cristianesimo elemento comune alla vita personale e sociale di tutti noi affermando che allorigine della civilt europea si trova il cristianesimo non si vuole introdurre alcun criterio confessionale esclusivo si vuole invece fare riferimento alle radici comuni delleuropa a quella morale unitaria che esalta la figura e la responsabilit della persona umana col suo fermento di fraternit evangelica
6227733 nel momento in cui gli stati uniti rivendicano con orgoglio la dimensione collettiva della loro esperienza religiosa lassenza di un richiamo al cristianesimo assumerebbe il significato di un imperdonabile atto di rimozione storica
6227734 alleuropa conclude brienza serve infatti reinfondere nella politica la sua cultura la sua tradizione la sua saggezza e anche la sua religione il cristianesimo vivo nelle chiese e nellagor anchesso potrebbe rientrare nella carta portato da uomini nuovi orgogliosi di essere europei con una costituzione comune

6227737 i am really looking forward to my first nationwide race
6227738 ive never raced at bristol so my main goal is to go out and just qualify first and foremost once in the race i plan to be patient race smart and capitalize on my short track racing experience
6227739 arca has been and continues to be a great learning experience for me i have had the opportunity to compete on a lot of different types of tracks and i am looking forward to applying that experience at the next level
6227740 participating in the nascar nationwide series event at bristol will be a great way for john wes to be exposed to racing at the next level
6227741 bristol is a demanding venue and the nationwide series has some of the most competitive racing anywhere were going there with the mind set that we just want to qualify for the race and run all 250 laps that is a tall order for bristol but i believe we can deliver on that expectation
6227742 townleys run in the ncts will give him some racing experience that will translate over and hopefully give him a head start for friday nights race
6227743 it will be cool working with wally brown in a race ive worked with him a lot in the jgr sprint cup testing team but never under race conditions i probably have more time working with wally overall than i have with dave rogers its a really unfortunate situation but i think we can still be really competitive this weekend and beyond we are going to sit down and talk to each other about the car and what we need to do to run well this weekend in bristol he knows what i want in a race car and i know his mindset setting up the car ive really worked with him closely since he came over to jgr in 2006 so it will be nice to still have someone around that im really comfortable with and can communicate well with
6227744 i was running third toward the end of a hooters pro cup race there in 2005 and the leaders wrecked each other and i got in the middle of it which can happen at bristol any time bristol is crazy you are plastered down in the seat and its kind of like a small dover which is also a demanding track the biggest thing about bristol is that everything happens so fast there since you are getting around that place in around 15 seconds a lap
6227745 i look forward to it theres no doubt its the most physically demanding track we run at you push so many gs through the corner that you spend so much time down and to the right in the seat and you really dont have much time to think as soon as you come out of the corner and onto the straightaway you are back in the corner again before you know it you have to be on your a game every lap at bristol but i feel like im prepared for a place like bristol even though i dont look it i work out at the shop every day and its one of those races that the workout regimen will always pay off
6227746 while the circumstances are far from ideal im looking forward to bristol and getting to work with joey logano in this weekends nationwide series race ive had the pleasure of working with joey throughout the past couple of years on the jgr sprint cup test team and ive obviously been impressed with his natural talent and ability to give excellent feedback on the handling of his race car its a really unfortunate situation but we are going to work hard in order to run up front and be in contention to win like this team has all year long
6227747 you never know how quick youre going to click with a crew chief fortunately for me ive been able to do that with a lot of crew chiefs that ive worked with over the years ive had pretty much a different crew chief in every series and every single year of my racing career for the last 10 years really since i was 13 ive had at least 10 different crew chiefs and in certain years its been three or four different crew chiefs ive worked with a lot of different people but ive always been able to adapt since ive run in so many different series with different crew chiefs
6227748 i think the perfect balance would be some good green flag racing with a couple of green flag stops and yet still having some wrecks with the racing that we have there its pretty good racing there now with the three lanes but you dont see as much beating and banging for the one groove that we all had to fight for before because we can go anywhere now its good racing but theres less contact and more room to maneuver around although you might see a little more of the bump and run stuff in the nationwide series cars as opposed to the cup cars i think the fans have their different opinions and youre never going to be able to please everybody
6227749 its different for the nationwide series and the cup series for sure since the race there last august was pretty wild for the nationwide guys and myself last year everybody went all out and it was fun and entertaining for the fans with the track being a three groove race track theres a lot more room for everybody but its still bristol and its going to be exciting
6227750 i would have to say hurricane danny in 1997 after making landfall in the early morning hours around 4 am or so it was suppose to be in montgomery that afternoon four days later it was still in southwest alabama area dumping 43 inches of rain
6227751 betsy actually did two loops in the atlantic before moving across southern florida
6227752 it was just constant rain for several days and when i was younger they cancelled halloween on us the storm also hit the northern gulf coast three times
6227753 in many cases its almost as if you have to forecast the intensity of the storm correctly in order to then forecast the track correctly but then the worst thing we do in hurricane prediction is forecast intensity
6227754 these are what we call nightmare storms simply from a forecasting perspective because they are so fickle with their steering levels

6227825 this is a record that belies anything approaching sound judgment
6227826 he has consistently been quick draw mccain here on every issue his first instinct is to rattle sabres and look for a military solution
6227827 john mccain lets face it hes got a compelling biography
6227828 thats what people think about instead of focusing on the fact that he wants to continue the same economic policies that george bushs been doing for the last eight years
6227829 i honour his service but i dont honour his policies and i dont honour his politics
6227830 yesterday senator obama got a little testy on this issue he said i am questioning his patriotism
6227831 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment senator obama has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6227832 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether american wins or loses
6227833 oh man you just dont know it hurts it really hurts
6227834 he was arrested in pensacola and will be extradited back to baldwin county

6227983 but about two years ago the situation became absolutely unbearable
6227984 i discovered that cadmium and other heavy metals in sludge can cause certain types of kidney cancer
6227985 then i started checking around and found other neighbors bordering the farm all of whom were on well water who also had kidney diseases
6227986 my mom lives right across the road from this place
6227987 my doctors said i have tumors and cysts in my nasal passages and sinus cavities im almost always congested i take over the counter medicines like allegra and nothing ever helps i also have kidney problems
6227988 what concerns me more is that my 17 year old daughters hair has started falling out
6227989 though the county has wisely hired an environmental law firm to help it negotiate a voluntary monitoring agreement with lhr farms and has paid for water testing county officials are not leading the charge for change
6227990 the lawsuit is a last resort but its the only thing left to do
6227991 we met with lhr farms on the violations and we are still working out how it should be resolved
6227992 when we met with them they provided a lot of explanations
6227993 theyd say yes we made a mistake well correct it
6227994 we have a contract with earth products in plains ga which mixes sludge with peanut shells normally sludge from the digesters part of the wastewater treatment plant would go there

6227996 the epd does not have the funds or staff to monitor hulsey as he needs to be monitored
6227997 i havent talked to mr hulsey in a few weeks and i havent heard about this lawsuit so im out of the loop
6227998 we know of no lawsuit against us we have no comment
6227999 theres clearly property devaluation to the residents the goal is to have hulsey and the farm be a good neighbor
6228000 more than 90 percent of our cases are eventually settled out of court
6228001 i understand that waste is a fact of life but if its disposed of properly you shouldnt have the odors and pollution
6228002 when its all said and done i hope he leaves this county
6228003 it is unfortunate that a few isolated individuals have filed a lawsuit against lhr farms

6228021 if you have had preeclampsia you should be aware that you are at increased risk for renal and cardiovascular disease and you should try to reduce that risk
6228022 historically the thought was that after delivery everything was fine but preeclampsia isnt benign and it may initiate a cascade of damage that takes years to develop into clinically relevant renal disease
6228023 the take home message from this study is that any young woman who has had any variant of preeclampsia and eclampsia needs to be monitored for ongoing or recurrent kidney disease high blood pressure and diabetes

6228033 these institutions are like cities and a lot of goods and materials and people have to come in and out all the time
6228034 we bring in boxes truckloads of things all the time so we have to have methods and procedures and policies to search these things and keep them out

6228136 they are clearly not as keen on investing in the financial sector until the credit crisis plays out

6228142 pimstein was able to convince a couple people there to use their computers to control the bank accounts that he laundered the money through
6228143 it was about making money and then it turned into pimstein being the center of attention
6228144 him being important to these people that were friends he played baseball with them he knows their kids in some cases
6228145 i cant believe somebody would go to so much trouble to try to take advantage of you

6228152 in reality pimstein and the bottom line had no business relationship with ripley
6228153 he does not seek a public airing of his loss but does not want his business or reputation damaged by association
6228154 he would have just stopped at nothing to get any cent he could out of anybody
6228155 the minutes were very much a repeat of last month except that near term upside inflation risks had eased with the fall in the oil price but the committee remains very nervous that a cut now would send the wrong signal to wage and price setters
6228156 the mpc vote was as expected a case could be made for either a hike or a cut though a move in either direction might subsequently have to be reversed so why bother all in all rates on hold probably for the rest of the year
6228157 we thought two may have gone for a cut but its broadly in line with what the market was expecting
6228158 we may be seeing the marginalisation here of besleys vote and a shift to blanchflowers view
6228159 given the downside in inflation expectations after the bank of england report last week some in the market were picking more members to have voted for a cut in august so theres a bit of disappointment that it was unchanged from last month
6228160 the minutes of augusts mpc meeting might be seen as a touch more hawkish than expected after last weeks inflation report
6228161 as expected the vote was the same as in july with tim besley and david blanchflower offsetting each others votes
6228162 but the tone of the discussion confirms that the interest rate debate remains finely balanced for now with most members concluding that the outlook for growth had worsened but that the risks to the inflation outlook remain on the upside
6228163 accordingly there is little here to suggest that other members are about to join blanchflower in voting for a cut in the very near future
6228164 nonetheless with inflation close to a peak and the economy heading towards recession we still think rates could be falling by year end and will eventually drop much further than the markets expect
6228165 no surprises in the vote outcome it was probably too early for besley to change his mind with inflation likely to pick up in coming months it implies that the bank is more worried about the precarious growth outlook than inflation but inflation is too high to convince most of the need to lower rates right now
6228166 as already indicated by the boes inflation report the boe is increasingly concerned about the outlook for growth while the near term worries about inflation are offsetting this for now
6228167 nonetheless with commodity prices having fallen substantially and the labour market downturn intensifying we believe that these inflation fears should subside in coming months
6228168 given the lagged effects of utility bill hikes inflation is likely to peak at around 5 percent before falling substantially through 2009 this should allow the opportunity for aggressive rate cuts in 2009 we see the policy rate at 3 5 percent in 3q09

6228186 opera thinks it is acceptable under specific circumstances to release a security update without publishing an advisory for the specific bug
6228187 if we publish without an advisory it is often because other vendors have not issued patches
6228188 publishing a full advisory only because weve patched something could leave users of other products unprotected while giving malicious hackers the information needed to cause damage

6228210 the response from the members is positive and around 150 members of the association comprising all big broking firms have already registered derivatives are good for better price realisation and it is a very good opportunity for brokers to add to their income even jobbers and arbitragers are really seeing this as an opportunity
6228211 it is interesting to note that the high potential office micro markets anticipated to clock increased growth in demand would do so essentially on the back of affordable product values improving infrastructure and enhanced product being delivered it is expected that over the next 8 10 quarters such markets could witness strong pre leasing commitments by occupiers despite robust supply pipelines which are in place

6228282 we lose our most complete running back in my opinion the guy who can do all three phases of the game run the ball catch the ball and pass protect
6228283 a lot of the other guys can do two of the three things but i dont know if any of them have all three facets we just have to be smart about whos in and what were asking them to do

6228290 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it
6228291 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
6228292 i think he would do for senator obama what lyndon johnson did for john kennedy hes got serious foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that senator obama has right now who can go toe to toe with any republican on any issue at any time

6228314 the school did not merely find the confederate flag offensive to some students but rather found that in a context of high racial tensions race related altercations and threats of violence the flag would disrupt the schools educational process
6228315 we have all along felt it was in the best interest of our school environment to not allow any symbols that might be racially divisive in any way
6228316 its very clear this panel doesnt like the confederate flag
6228317 that was their starting point in coming to the decision they did the subject matter of the ban is not supposed to be relevant at all in a first amendment analysis

6228327 in this particular case the rule violation was serious and was attempting to interfere with our ability to conduct an accurate post race competitive analysis

6228329 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis

6228358 looking into it further to see what we can do

6228360 the general market whether its right or wrong has come to the conclusion that the common shares probably dont have much true equity value
6228361 the stock has already collapsed and has been dragging down the market but its got to a point where whether the stock is at 6 or 4 makes no difference its essentially just an option price which indicates that equity investors have given up on the stock
6228362 i usually dont get off when men are pounding hard on my breasts or squeezing or pinching them really hard just do it kindly and nicely to my nipples massage them im kind of sensitive underneath my boobs as well so just moving your hands back and forth under my boobs feels really good lick them but dont bite them and one of the other things is i have a hard time getting off when im on top unless the guy holds my breasts i like to grind when im riding a guys cock i like to move back and forth but the only way i can get off is if he has at least one hand on my boobs its always been like that for me unless im on the bottom in which case i can cum any way i want but when im on top i need to have that kind of sensitivity and stimulation but if he squeezes too hard i lose interest if a guy is nice to me while im riding him then i definitely cum

6228380 as well the proportion who reported becoming sexually active at a very early age decreased
6228381 however among those who were sexually active there was no significant change in the likelihood of having multiple partners or for males using condoms so while some adolescents have adopted measures to reduce their risks of sexually transmitted infection and unwanted pregnancy others report high risk behaviour

6228386 we are confident of our decision to invest in one of the leading indian internet properties
6228387 cafegadgets specialises in online sales of it products and electronic gadgets and the synergy between the two companies will provide us with a huge customer base
6228388 we will also benefit from cafegadgets close association with the vendors in it products and mobile phones categories as it has already been representing many of the major brands as their online distributors for quite some time now

6228397 more recently weve had teenagers having parties in the basement
6228398 this is eye tracking equipment that looks at the movement of your eyes
6228399 it measures 250 variables per second and includes movements of left to right or up and down pupil area diameter and blink rate
6228400 expert surgeons tend to focus on the operative field they look at a certain area
6228401 their pupils get quiet and dont oscillate as much and they dont blink as much whereas a novice is not quite sure where theyre looking they look all over the operative field they tend to blink more and the pupils tend to dilate or shrink a lot more rapidly
6228402 you cant claim to be an expert if youre blinking too much or your eye movement is too fast
6228403 so you start off you probably see some modest numbers and parameters
6228404 as you go along in your training you probably see improvements and benchmarks and goals for yourself
6228405 sometimes when all your dreams may have seen better days

6228413 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6228414 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud in a felonious manner
6228415 at this time the victim of this series of deceptions searching for bigfoot inc is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception due to this event peoples lives have been disrupted and many people so wanting vindication about there prior experiences were hurt let us all try to be mindful of such

6228424 the injury situation itself could sort things out were ready to start work for tennessee and if youre hurt
6228425 as a far as me competing i feel i have done all i can its not just running with the ball you have to get the blocking down and protect and catch passes you have to show youre an all around running back and not a limited one
6228426 hes a small linebacker but hes smart and quick and fast and tough
6228427 how effectively he can play well have to wait and see pain will be issue but more importantly can he grab and use his hand

6228432 seem to be focusing on the gasoline demand number within it and ignoring the very large buildup of crude oil on the week
6228433 that s a very popular trip for all sorts of people to take in the investment community
6228434 people who are interested in the future of oil in north america have trekked up to the oilsands to see what they look like
6228435 everybody thought the oil price was coming down and the oil market is relatively tight

6228441 i saw how the plane broke in two and a huge explosion
6228442 we heard a big crash big big crash so we stopped and we saw a lot of smoke there is a lot of confusion people are trying to call their families
6228443 the whole field went up in flames the emergency services couldnt get to the plane because of the fire going on engulfing the whole fuselage
6228444 the plane was going to return and i just dont know the plane was supposed to have arrived by now

6228446 i would just like to say that we are extremely sorry and our thoughts are with the families and we will do everything we can to support them through this very very difficult period
6228447 i think there was a lot of quick worries that things would get worse theres been helicopters continually heading to the scene dropping water over the area
6228448 of course madrid is quite well known for getting forest fires so they responded very quickly to this
6228449 and were seeing lots of ambulances leaving the area theres been about 50 in the last hour or so which have passed me by on the way out of the airport

6228505 our provider agreement may suggest that we have certain weekly limits but were open to negotiation on that

6228514 the school did not merely find the confederate flag offensive to some students but rather found that in a context of high racial tensions race related altercations and threats of violence the flag would disrupt the schools educational process
6228515 we have all along felt it was in the best interest of our school environment to not allow any symbols that might be racially divisive in any way

6228521 at one point we thought content was the value point of universities wrong mits opencourseware initiative changed that ok then the interaction with faculty is the value point and wrong again open communication and collaboration in online environments with networks of peers and experts gave us control over our interactions fine then the value point is accreditation yes for now our ability to rate review comment and provide feedback has increased with the development of the read write web im not sure how long we can build educations value on the concept of accreditation as ive frequently suggested we can glean much insight from a field that has spent more time journeying down the path of shifting value from content to something else the news journalism media industry
6228522 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability

6228529 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6228530 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6228531 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6228532 as you know attorney general guidelines were first implemented in the wake of the fbi abuses of the 1960s and 1970s and serve as one of the most important bulwarks against future abuses
6228533 given the importance of these guidelines providing a period of time for public comment would be a reasonable and responsible way to move forward and achieve the best possible end result
6228534 the guidelines will require all activities to have a valid purpose
6228535 we are particularly concerned that the draft guidelines might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities

6228570 radomir antic is the new coach of the team he has accepted our offer
6228571 the price we have heard has made us think twice about the move
6228572 the transfer fee that his agent told us was not very inviting usually the price that an agent states is lower than what the club has in mind
6228573 we will therefore keep the transfer offer under consideration and think about it he is a good player but we must be able to pay the fee and thats to be seen
6228574 let it be clear we have a very good group of players and i dont want to see any of them leave we have shown that to be the case earlier too
6228575 we had the chance of replying to the offers of other clubs like manchester city but he as well as me said no
6228576 people were perhaps expecting djibril to move to a prestigious team and sunderland without being among the great english clubs are part of a league where clubs have all the economic power and sporting importance
6228577 with sunderland it isnt an impulsive thing but as he came to the end of this transfer window he wanted to leave and showed a massive desire to play
6228578 it is that more than his divorce from om that is in his mind at the moment
6228579 it is a chance for him to get his life back in order as far as his career and as far as the france team is concerned
6228580 everyone knows that his absence from the euros mortified him and he was fearing he would lose his place for good with les bleus if he stayed on the bench here
6228581 all these elements have played their part in this choice he has made and to which we have responded favourably

6228664 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around

6228748 the ladybird is a beetle its young are very different from the adult in appearance and feed upon plant lice
6228749 these little beetles are very common in autumn and may be brought to the schoolroom and passed around in vials for the children to observe their larvae may be found on almost any plant infested with plant lice plant and all may be brought into the school room and the actions of the larvae noted by the pupils during recess
6228750 from our standpoint the ladybird is of great value for during the larval as well as adult stages all species except one feed upon those insects which we are glad to be rid of
6228751 the ladybird is a clever little creature even if it does look like a pill and if you disturb it it will fold up its legs and drop as if dead playing possum in a most deceptive manner
6228752 i tell my kid sister that she should act like a lady and not give her pussy away
6228753 my little sister was so jealous when i got a soccer scholarship to college not because of school but because of all the hot guys i was gonna get

6228757 without doubt our research shows that information security professionals want to change to become information risk professionals and true business partners to add value and shape business strategy and processes
6228758 this change will involve more than just re labelling job functions activities and responsibilities skill sets will need to change as will the way security professionals communicate with their businesses and measure performance
6228759 it is clear that information security is changing radically and will continue to change
6228760 the pressure for this comes from within the profession and from external forces such as businesses regulators and changes in culture and behaviour
6228761 at a global level key drivers include legislation and technology resulting in changes that include moving from cost to value propositions and from metrics to performance indicators
6228762 at the regional level compliance becomes a bigger driver than technology whilst skill shortages clearly have a greater effect in some regions compared to others
6228763 one of the men ran towards the third security guard who was positioned across the road adjacent to the getaway car raised his firearm at the guard and the guard in self defence fired one shot

6228836 i was trying to figure out how they did the draws last night and its not a good draw
6228837 but i guess its just fun to play your friends and you gotta beat everyone to get to the finals so you might as well start off like that
6228838 you know its gonna be a tough match and its kind of a no win situation
6228839 so ive seen him forever known him since he was this high
6228840 it was not a fun draw then we look behind us and weve got peter uihlein and weve got trent leon
6228841 trents a senior and our leader and im an incoming freshman but i snuck away with one neither of us played too well
6228842 thats what morgans for hes got a good sense of direction
6228843 he hit some real good shots out of the rough
6228844 ive been working out a lot so i guess i can get it out of the rough a little easier than i used to
6228845 his shafts were all too weak and he couldnt hit it straight
6228846 you start hitting better shots with your clubs and stuff and more confidence comes
6228847 that would have been nice since thats the toughest hole on the course
6228848 in the current environment it is hard to find any specific triggers for these moves
6228849 i think were seeing consolidation but personally i think that theres scope for a rebound in the aussie dollar
6228850 the us dollar is consolidating after what we saw in the last couple of weeks which were fairly dramatic moves
6228851 we think this pullback is going to happen eventually in the short term however the overall sentiment remains us dollar positive
6228852 im just trying to make it less dry down there
6228853 and we ask one question that they dare not firmly answer whether they are not now making a tolerable attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the people

6228865 one of our main challenges is locating the right person in our organisation to answer a customer query in a timely manner and then being able to contact them directly
6228866 this was underlined by a recent report that showed 20 percent of our contact centre agents time was spent looking for the right person in our organization to handle specific customer queries what we needed was a technology solution that would leverage our prior investment in a company wide videoconferencing system with new capability to unify voice video and customer information and provide personalised customer contact with improved customer service
6228867 nortel impressed us with the direct software integration between its communication network and microsofts office communications server software providing specific information about each of our expert resources available in real time to all of our branches
6228868 this gives us an incredibly powerful platform for connecting our people with our customers in a variety of different ways through audio video text and im and ensures that regardless of where our customers are located we have the resources available to serve them
6228869 were already looking past the initial implementation to the next phase of the project which will extend the reach of our video enabled unified communications services to our customers through the web
6228870 this will give customers direct access to our consultants through the video conferencing system presenting them with a new way of communicating directly with our staff without having to leave their homes
6228871 nortel and microsofts alliance gives them a clear time to market advantage thats well ahead of what any of their competitors could muster
6228872 it was also obvious that we were speaking the same language when it comes to reducing our carbon footprint through energy efficient technology and cutting back on unnecessary travel and it was also an easy sell to my cfo the operational savings weve calculated as a result of implementing this technology are substantial delivering significant customer service enhancement more efficiently will have lasting benefits on both our top and bottom line
6228873 nortels solution is helping necu overcome the challenges of one to one communication in an organisation that is spread across multiple branches some in remote rural areas
6228874 this unified communications approach will help necu stand out from the crowd as people look for different ways of collaborating with each other and their service organisations using multiple web enabled devices in todays era of hyperconnectivity when anything that can be connected to the network is being connected
6228875 i am delighted to see mark phelps take responsibility for the management of the firm since my return to management early last year mark and a number of other associates have worked unstintingly to get the firm through its recent challenges and i am very happy that mark has now agreed to accept the additional responsibilities of ceo

6228878 i am also very pleased with arrow capital managements association with our firm arrows senior principals alex von furstenberg and mal serure are very serious and successful long term investors and our on going cooperation should significantly benefit our clients in the years ahead

6228893 the government knows there are alternatives to secure the same amount of water with a fraction of those carbon costs

6228895 the government hasnt allowed the planning panel or ees to examine strategic options for augmenting melbournes water supply different technologies from desalination and potential locations outside wonthaggi
6228896 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6228897 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6228898 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6228899 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6228900 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6228901 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6228902 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6228903 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6228904 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6228905 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6228906 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6228907 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6228908 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6228909 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6228910 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6228911 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6228923 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6228924 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6228925 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6228926 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6228927 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6228928 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6228929 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6228930 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6228931 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6228932 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6228933 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6228934 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6228935 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6228936 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6228937 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6228938 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6228939 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6228940 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6228941 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6228942 i have exhausted myself totally i have exhausted each and every ounce of strength i have and wisdom i harbor and this is the best possible experience and match i have had in my whole lifetime
6228943 beach volleyball is such that it is entertaining in nature yet it really advocates a good fighting spirit
6228944 i usually dont get off when men are pounding hard on my breasts or squeezing or pinching them really hard just do it kindly and nicely to my nipples massage them im kind of sensitive underneath my boobs as well so just moving your hands back and forth under my boobs feels really good lick them but dont bite them and one of the other things is i have a hard time getting off when im on top unless the guy holds my breasts i like to grind when im riding a guys cock i like to move back and forth but the only way i can get off is if he has at least one hand on my boobs its always been like that for me unless im on the bottom in which case i can cum any way i want but when im on top i need to have that kind of sensitivity and stimulation but if he squeezes too hard i lose interest if a guy is nice to me while im riding him then i definitely cum

6228948 my little sister was so jealous when i got a soccer scholarship to college not because of school but because of all the hot guys i was gonna get
6228949 its cool to say you live on south beach because everybody knows where it is and that its one of the hottest places in the country
6228950 its a little different than going to the farmers market and picking out a few things i whats going to be in the box mother nature determines that because of the surprise factor every delivery is like a top chef challenge

6228957 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6228958 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6228959 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas

6228965 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6228966 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6228967 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s

6228969 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6228970 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6228971 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6228972 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6228973 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6228974 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6228975 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6228976 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6228977 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6228978 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6228979 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6228980 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

6228982 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto

6228987 taxes and spending in burlington county have risen dramatically in the past five years it is unacceptable that while burlington county residents continue to pay more in taxes these insiders are living off of the public trough
6228988 these same 20 loan guarantors have combined to make over 30 million dollars in government salaries contracts billings and pension credits
6228989 its kind of ironic that after one of the largest tax hikes in eveshams history they come up with this
6228990 weve been pounding them on taxes what better way to distract the public than to trump this stuff up its all forthright and its all above board
6228991 when i first brought up bob stears several years ago the republicans scoffed at my efforts
6228992 it took a us attorney a grand jury and an eventual guilty plea to prove that i was right from the beginning we will pursue these issues with the same vigilance
6228993 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6228994 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6228995 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6228996 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6228997 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6228998 therefore if god gave to them the same gift as he gave to us also after believing in the lord jesus christ who was i that i could stand in gods way
6228999 well then god has granted to the gentiles also the repentance that leads to life
6229000 what have i done to you to make you beat me these three times
6229001 you have made a fool of me if i had a sword in my hand i would kill you right now
6229002 am i not your own donkey which you have always ridden to this day have i been in the habit of doing this to you
6229003 if it were to mean every single person then the spirit would be poured out onto believers and unbelievers alike regardless of whether or not they ever come to belief in him
6229004 now we turn to acts 10 where most of the details of cornelius conversion are recorded cornelius was a very good man verse 2 but he was not saved he needed to know about jesus and his life teachings death burial and resurrection he was told in a vision to send for peter that he might hear what he needed to know verses 3 6 let me pause here for just a moment much is made about the fact that cornelius received the holy spirit before water baptism since the holy spirit is promised only to christians many conclude that cornelius was saved prior to baptism what about the fact that cornelius was given a vision from god does that make him saved because the lord spoke to him in a vision obviously some special and scripturally unique things are at work in the case of cornelius please keep that in mind
6229005 you know the message he sent to the people of israel through jesus christ they already knew about jesus and if you use the kjv you have to consult verse 37 to see they already know now one other minor but interesting point there is this peter says in acts 10 47 can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water they have received the holy spirit just as we have
6229006 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit
6229007 well then god has granted to the gentiles also the repentance that leads to life
6229008 repent and let every one of you be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit 10 47 can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water they have received the holy spirit just as we have
6229009 that word you know which was proclaimed throughout all judea and began from galilee after the baptism which john preached
6229010 you know the message he sent to the people of israel through jesus christ they already knew about jesus and if you use the kjv you have to consult verse 37 to see they already know now one other minor but interesting point there is this peter says in acts 10 47 can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water they have received the holy spirit just as we have
6229011 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit
6229012 repent and let every one of you be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit 10 47 can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water they have received the holy spirit just as we have
6229013 that word you know which was proclaimed throughout all judea and began from galilee after the baptism which john preached they already knew about jesus even in the kjv it clearly says that in verse 37 thus it appears that you are incorrect in part of your study cory preached to whom to the jews that is pretty much the whole point of cornelius conversion the gospel was to be taken to the jews first since they would have a knowledge of the messiah once again we have to consider if peter was speaking for himself or by the power of the spirit when he makes the statement in acts 2 38 it would appear that his time line of what should happen does not happen in acts 10 also there are some who are baptized by water who do not have the holy spirit until later but are not re baptized if memory serves acts 8 16for as yet he had fallen upon none of them they had only been baptized in the name of the lord jesus i guess you need to decide that for yourself i have no reason to believe that peter was uninspired you do if you acknowledge that peter was inspired on pentecost youd have to obey the words of the lord he taught that day and it seems clear you dont want to do that i guess peter was only inspired if his teachings fall in line with your beliefs as jeff pointed out after cornelius no one had the holy spirit fall on them in this manner you cant find a single example of such after that occasion the only way people received the miraculous gifts of the holy spirit was to have the apostles lay their hands on them much of what you wrote was repetitive so ive only addressed those things once ive tried to cover everything that was worth addressing august 11 2008 said i must say im impressed with walkinginlove you remind me of somebodywho use to preach in the church of christ august 11 2008 said as for the holy spirit falling on someone like happened in acts first the bible does not exist so the ability to give the word to others can be done through the translations and since i see speaking in other languages as a tool to reach the unsaved it would not be needed however if in a remote location that was limited to the word i could see god doing so if he needed to do so who am i to stand in the way of god i believe is our proper response i believe that peters message was inspired that lead to them asking the question i do question based on observations of the later events that run counter to acts 2 38 that the question they asked may have caught him off guard and the temptation to be a lose cannon may have brought his response that same lose cannon that allowed him to walk on water and to also be called satan by jesus himself his personality has to be a factor taken into consideration that is one of the reasons i trust pauls focus more because he was a letter of the law personality and he is focused on faith statements and not works he had tried the works road and it had lead him into conflict with the one he was seeking to serve god by his personality he should have been dunking people left and right but he wasnt why i know he was not called to do so but why was he not called to lead others to salvation instead of leading them 4 5s the way it would be like me throwing you a life ring but not pulling you to safety hey grab this and then i let you go over the falls with the ring in hand only to perish except for a few that he baptized acts 11 17so if god gave them the same gift as he gave us who believed in the lord jesus christ who was i to think that i could oppose god
6229014 preached to whom to the jews that is pretty much the whole point of cornelius conversion the gospel was to be taken to the jews first since they would have a knowledge of the messiah
6229015 churchesofchrist on august 11 2008 said i must say im impressed with walkinginlove you remind me of somebodywho use to preach in the church of christ
6229016 you are my brother but you are wrong wrong wrong and a little stupid
6229017 here is what youre saying you accept peters inspiration until he commands baptism for the remission of sins
6229018 why would he allow them to begin preaching an incomplete gospel is the lord not capable of giving them all they need to know
6229019 take your son your only son isaac whom you love and go to the region of moriah sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains i will tell you about
6229020 leave your country your people and your fathers household and go to the land i will show you
6229021 i will make you into a great nation and i will bless you i will make your name great and you will be a blessing 3 i will bless those who bless you and whoever curses you i will curse and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you
6229022 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6229023 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6229024 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6229025 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6229026 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6229027 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6229028 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6229029 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6229030 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6229031 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6229032 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6229033 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6229034 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6229035 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6229036 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6229037 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6229038 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6229039 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6229040 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6229041 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6229042 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6229043 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6229044 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6229045 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6229046 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6229047 if people think they lehman are heading toward bankruptcy nobody will want to do business with them or make them new loans thats fulds biggest problem
6229048 they are clearly not as keen on investing in the financial sector until the credit crisis plays out
6229049 selling off assets would be at fire sale prices and investors will bark if you try and sell some of the crown jewels of the company
6229050 we anticipate that lehman will reduce its overall mortgage exposure by 20 per cent suggesting about a us15 billion a17 22 billion reduction
6229051 buy them some time and allow them to emerge from the crisis and rebuild

6229067 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

6229070 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6229071 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6229072 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6229073 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6229074 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6229075 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6229076 dont read this if you dont need a star employee
6229077 revealed 3 ways to save 57 000 or more for your business
6229078 hi this is steve jones at 612 567 8901 i just spent the morning talking to three of your competitors they told me that
6229079 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6229080 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6229081 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6229082 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6229083 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6229084 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6229085 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6229086 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6229087 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6229088 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6229089 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6229090 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6229091 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6229092 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6229093 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6229094 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6229095 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6229096 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6229097 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6229098 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6229099 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6229100 mahmoud darwish is the essential breath of the palestinian people the eloquent witness of exile and belonging exquisitely tuned singer of images that invoke link and shine a brilliant light into the worlds whole heart what he speaks has been embraced by readers around the world his in an utterly necessary voice unforgettable once discovered
6229101 nothing concerns it other than its cadence a wind rising for itself to rise and a fragility that checks in on the human within his relics
6229102 for what is a poet doing there there in the executive council
6229103 the creative palestinian is prohibited from the luxury of vacated and dedicated time for the sake of creativity because this is bound to a direct cessation from patriotic activity yet prisoners grow flowers in their prison yards and in front of the zinc huts mothers plant basil and mint the creative person must create his flexible margin between the patriotic the political the daily the cultural and the literary but what am i to do what does a poet do in the executive council will i be able to write a book of love when color falls on the ground in autumn
6229104 we came with the wind from babylon and we march to babylon
6229105 and the sonnets a strangers template for anothers vernacular develop the spine that gives the book its sway as man and woman poetry and prose commune with each other

6229108 from two martyrs to eight and fifty olive trees in addition to the structural defect that will afflict the poem and the play and the incomplete painting
6229109 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6229110 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6229111 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6229112 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6229113 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6229114 its a monkey its not like it did anything bad
6229115 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6229116 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6229117 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6229118 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6229119 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6229120 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6229121 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6229122 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6229123 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6229124 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6229125 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6229126 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6229127 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6229128 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6229129 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6229130 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6229131 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6229132 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6229133 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6229134 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6229135 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6229136 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6229137 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6229138 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6229139 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6229140 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6229141 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6229142 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6229143 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6229144 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6229145 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6229146 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6229147 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6229148 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6229149 only a few more yards until we are in range
6229150 our projected value of each point is in excess of 1 900
6229151 it is unprecedented that claims can begin going out in an eight month period
6229152 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6229153 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6229154 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6229155 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6229156 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6229157 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6229158 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6229159 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6229160 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6229161 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6229162 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6229163 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6229164 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6229165 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6229166 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6229167 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6229168 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6229169 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6229170 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6229171 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6229172 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6229173 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6229174 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6229175 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6229176 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6229177 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6229178 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6229179 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6229180 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6229181 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6229182 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
6229183 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
6229184 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
6229185 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6229186 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6229187 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6229188 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6229189 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6229190 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6229191 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6229192 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6229193 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6229194 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6229195 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6229196 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6229197 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6229198 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6229199 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
6229200 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
6229201 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
6229202 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
6229203 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
6229204 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
6229205 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6229206 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6229207 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6229208 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6229209 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6229210 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6229211 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6229212 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6229213 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6229214 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6229215 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6229216 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6229217 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6229218 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6229219 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6229220 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6229221 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6229222 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6229223 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6229224 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6229225 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6229226 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6229227 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6229228 youre not making money until youre making it in your sleep
6229229 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6229230 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6229231 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6229232 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6229233 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6229234 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6229235 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6229236 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6229237 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6229238 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6229239 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6229240 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6229241 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6229242 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6229243 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6229244 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6229245 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6229246 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6229247 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6229248 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6229249 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6229250 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6229251 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6229252 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6229253 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6229254 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6229255 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6229256 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6229257 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6229258 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6229259 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6229260 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6229261 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6229262 this is a planning took where all things are going
6229263 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6229264 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6229265 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6229266 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6229267 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6229268 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6229269 from the day schumers letter was made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable
6229270 el xito de los gobiernos de la concertaci n en el combate a la delincuencia
6229271 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6229272 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6229273 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6229274 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6229275 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6229276 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6229277 im not in a position to confirm or deny that
6229278 obviously its a personal matter and brett is working through that
6229279 the selectors are comfortable this move will maintain the competitive edge for the australian side and provide a wonderful opportunity for brett geeves to join the australian group for the first time
6229280 we look forward to brett lee rejoining the group as soon as possible

6229297 en el congreso la derecha tiene mayor a la candidatura de lugo cont con el respaldo del partido liberal radical aut ntico plra de ideolog a de derecha y representante de terratenientes
6229298 ellos van a defender sus intereses y no van a aceptar ninguna ocupaci n de tierras ni reducci n de los latifundios
6229299 lugo est en una posici n m s de izquierda ya sali a decir que cree que las ocupaciones de tierras son leg timas como ltima instancia en la negociaci n pol tica y respalda la lucha de los campesinos por una reforma agraria integral sin embargo creemos que se va a encontrar con muchas contradicciones va a tener que asumir algunos acuerdos con la burgues a por ello el movimiento social se est preparando para apoyar las posiciones del presidente lugo y llegado el momento presionar para que se concreten los cambios
6229300 ni bien gan lugo los compa eros se organizaron y empezaron a ocupar tierras especialmente en el norte del pa s donde hay una zona muy conflictiva y donde el movimiento campesino est m s organizado e ideologizado
6229301 el an lisis realizado por nuestro movimiento es que este no es un momento estrat gico para presionar no se puede presionar al gobierno saliente que no va ofrecer garant as ni soluciones y tampoco al entrante al que hay que darle un poco de tiempo para ver si efectivamente cumple con lo que ha prometido
6229302 creo si que los compa eros en el interior est n preparados para ocupar como una medida de fuerza que me parece correcto y creo que el movimiento campesino est lo suficientemente maduro pol ticamente para tratar primero de agotar las instancias institucionales para despu s en caso de que no se cumpla con lo prometido comenzar a presionar
6229303 tambi n hay una presi n sobre todo de los medios de comunicaci n para crear en la opini n p blica una opini n desfavorable al gobierno de lugo creando temor y miedo
6229304 cuando el gobierno act e tocando intereses pol ticos fuertes la oposici n e incluso el partido liberal integrante de la coalici n de gobierno va a presionar para defender sus privilegios van a tratar de desestabilizar sectores para defender esos privilegios
6229305 y es b sicamente por eso que creo que mucho del peso pol tico que va a tener lugo depender de si puede llevar a cabo una reforma agraria integral
6229306 hay casi un mill n de empleados p blicos una clase media que vive directa o indirectamente de los recursos del estado
6229307 esas estructuras represivas siguen existiendo y lamentablemente ser dificil romperlas hoy d a los compa eros siguen siendo torturados en las c rceles del interior siguen siendo secuestrados por la polic a est n presos en situaci n ilegal siendo ocurriendo asesinatos pol ticos el a o pasado nos asesinaron a un compa ero y en lo que va de este a o han asesinados otros dos compa eros del movimiento y esto en un marco de democracia de elecciones y de libertad de expresi n
6229308 por sobre todo la acci n del nuevo gobierno estar focalizada en que los ministerios sean eficaces en sus gesti n que la salud la educaci n funcionen hay que recordar que en 61 a os en el poder el partido colorado ha creado una maquinaria impresionante de asistencial smo usando los recursos del estado en su beneficio y distribuyendo empleos p blicos y van a defender sus privilegios
6229309 espero que ojala se cumpla con lograr que los servicios del estado funcionen debidamente eso ser a un buen primer paso
6229310 en los ltimos a os el movimiento social se ha fortalecido ha logrado parar las privatizaciones la ley antiterrorista y fundamentalmente es el movimiento campesino el que m s capacidad de movilizaci n tiene creo que los compa eros del movimiento social est n conscientes de la necesidad de defender la institucionalidad en este momento
6229311 se logr acumular bastante fuerza y constituirse en el movimiento que present y apoy la candidatura de fernando lugo despu s en el trabajo se lograron acordar algunos proyectos program ticos lamentablemente en las discusiones program ticas en la coalici n fueron mimetizadas
6229312 ahora el gran desaf o es hacer un buen trabajo en los ministerios lograr una buena gesti n pero sin negligenciar el movimiento social de base que dio apoyo y crecimiento a todo esto
6229313 tomaron distancia del movimiento social concentr ndose sus cuadros en ocupar los lugares del gobierno y eso no permiti que el propio partido se dinamice
6229314 el gran desaf o seguir creciendo con la base seguir formando y construyendo el poder popular que es lo nico que nos va a garantizar un movimiento social ideologizado que nos va a permitir en el futuro y creo que es v lido para toda am rica latina poner freno a pol ticas neoliberales capitalistas para mi la nica forma concretar un cambio social estructural es constuyendo el poder popular

6229318 esta ha sido una negociaci n entre dos aliados y amigos cercanos y a pesar de que han habido altibajos naturalmente a lo largo de todo el proceso nos gratifica que ambas delegaciones hayan tratado esto en el esp ritu de intentar hacer algo que es importante para la seguridad de ambos pa ses y como aliados y amigos
6229319 lo que suceda en los pr ximos d as y meses determinar el futuro de las relaciones entre estados unidos y rusia pero del mismo modo mi opini n personal es que tienen que haber consecuencias para las acciones que rusia ha tomado contra un estado soberano
6229320 acuso al gobierno ruso de adoptar una pol tica de limpieza tnica y puedo probarlo con organizaciones internacionales que ya est n dando testimonio de lo que digo y recibimos 1 400 denuncias de ataques brutales asesinatos violaciones e internaci n de personas en violaci n de la convenci n de ginebra y del derecho humanitario internacional
6229321 como ya he dicho de acuerdo con el c digo de las naciones unidas estamos intentando imponer la paz a georgia que empez la agresi n consideramos que esta t ctica es muy efectiva y es la nica posible perm tanme recordarles que en la historia hemos visto muchos ejemplos de pacificaci n del agresor de esta manera los pa ses occidentales lo hicieron hace 70 a os y conocen las tr gicas consecuencias de eso quiero decir la lecci n del tratado de munich de 1938
6229322 rusia invadi un estado vecino soberano y amenaza a un gobierno democr tico electo por su pueblo
6229323 entendemos que el actual liderazgo de georgia es un proyecto especial de estados unidos pero un d a estados unidos tendr que elegir entre defender su prestigio por sobre un proyecto o una sociedad real que requiera acciones conjuntas
6229324 quiero dialogar con los rusos quiero que se retiren del territorio georgiano lo m s r pido posible y me interesa mantener buenas relaciones con rusia pero en el siglo xxi las naciones no invaden otras naciones
6229325 estamos sumamente decepcionados este informe aparentemente consiente el uso de la fuerza letal en una situaci n en la que los soldados no pod an y lo admiten estar seguros de lo que ten an frente creemos que hab a fundamentos suficientes para que se dieran cuenta que estaban frente a periodistas esto nos pone en una posici n en la que los periodistas no pueden levantar una c mara en presencia de los soldados israel es sin correr peligro de que les disparen eso es inaceptable y hablaremos con las autoridades israel es sobre c mo podemos mejorar la seguridad de nuestros periodistas en el futuro
6229326 el informe israel sobre el asesinato de fadel ha suscitado temores entre los periodistas palestinos que cubren el conflicto con israel en gaza entre los palestinos y los israel es en la franja de gaza sobre la misi n ustedes saben la misi n de cubrir y filmar y hemos estado escuchando comentarios de todos los otros colegas de que ya no est n seguros de sus vidas tras un informe como este que deja en claro que el simple hecho de levantar una c mara en la calle en un campo de refugiados o cerca de la frontera puede poner la vida de una persona en peligro
6229327 en este incidente del 16 de abril seis civiles fueron asesinados con proyectiles tipo flechette un arma ilegal que no deber a ser utilizada en estas condiciones en la franja de gaza y una de estas seis v ctimas era un periodista por todas estas razones era de esperarse que el ej rcito iniciara y dirigiera una investigaci n minuciosa sobre este caso pero decidi no hacerlo la falta de responsabilidad en este caso se refleja en la falta de responsabilidad en la muerte de miles de palestinos que fueron asesinados en los territorios ocupados
6229328 advertencia en este predio se utilizan dispositivos el ctricos paralizantes
6229329 lo que hoy d a ha expresado el pueblo boliviano con su voto es para consolidar este proceso de cambio estamos ac para seguir avanzando en la recuperaci n de nuestros recursos naturales en la consolidaci n de la nacionalizaci n en la recuperaci n de nuestras empresas del estado
6229330 lo que menos quiero ser yo es un factor disociador o que aprovechen la imagen de manfred para venir a una confrontaci n entre cochabambinos y es por eso que yo en el d a de hoy le estoy dejando al secretario general de la prefectura a johnny ferrel para que l contin e esta labor mientras yo haga las acciones legales pertinentes mientras yo demuestre que el decreto de la magistrada hab a sido nom s por la justicia boliviana
6229331 le pedimos a las naciones unidas y la sociedad internacional que presionen a corea del norte pakist n e israel a desnuclearizarse y tomar medidas dr sticas contra las armas nucleares que se sospecha tiene ir n

6229348 the move to elevate the domestic policy adviser to the post of assistant secretary for policy and international affairs signals the administrations determination to resist new environmental protections environmentalists said
6229349 francesca grifo who directs the scientific integrity program at the union of concerned scientists an advocacy group said that if hutto takes the helm of the energy departments climate policy office the impact could last well beyond bushs term in office because in the coming months hutto could make policy decisions that the next administration would find difficult to reverse quickly

6229392 gaza is largely dependent on israel for its supply of fuel and electricity already there are frequent power outages as a result of israels destruction of the main gaza power plant in 2006 and subsequent damage to electricity transformers for instance on 14 november the idf struck an electricity transformer in beit hanoun which knocked out power for 5 000 people in the area the supply of water is also affected and there is insufficient power for water pumps as a result 210 000 people are able to access drinking water supplies for only 1 2 hours a day sewage is also a problem sewage plants require repairs but materials such as metal pipes and welding machines have been prohibited by israel on the grounds that they may be used for making rockets at present there is a real danger that sewage plants could overflow cutting off fuel and electricity will exacerbate an already dangerous situation it will endanger the functioning of hospitals water services and sewage as well as depriving residents of electricity for refrigerators and household appliances a humanitarian catastrophe is contemplated if israel continues to reduce fuel and carries out its threat to reduce electricity supplies

6229447 estas leyes promulgadas est n apegadas a la constituci n
6229448 el jefe de estado s est facultado para dictar leyes org nicas cumpliendo el requerimiento de enviarlas a la sala constitucional del tribunal supremo de justicia tsj
6229449 en 2007 se publicaron 20 leyes muchas de stas a la espera de la propuesta de reforma constitucional que al no darse se tuvieron que reformular las legislaciones de manera que se mantuvieran dentro del texto constitucional vigente
6229450 estuve tentado a titular este art culo de manera distinta por ejemplo
6229451 en venezuela en mi punto de vista vivimos cambios intensos mas no una revoluci n todav a hay muchas cosas del pasado mucho lastre que no logramos superar la trama heredada opera como controlador del proceso y tardar tiempo para que sus logros se perciban con nitidez y se consoliden pero estamos viviendo tiempos de cambio estos se est n dando y quiz sea ste el rasgo m s significativo en libertad y en democracia con arreglo al estado de derecho consagrado en la constituci n de 1999
6229452 esos cambios tropiezan a cada instante con poderosos obst culos obst culos que colocan en el camino grupos econ micos poderes transnacionales viejos h bitos pol ticos y en general un pasado cargado de negatividad de revanchismo y la voluntad de garantizarse a como d lugar que las cosas sigan siendo como eran
6229453 la facultad del parlamento de habilitar al jefe del estado para dictar decretos con fuerza de ley siempre estuvo consagrada en el ordenamiento constitucional venezolano y la ejercieron los gobiernos en diferentes etapas de nuestra historia no es una novedad y menos a n un golpe de estado o una violaci n de la carta magna como algunos lo plantean
6229454 lo que sucede es que ahora se legisla con otro signo con otra orientaci n pero los 26 decretos leyes aprobados por ch vez en el marco de la habilitaci n que le otorg la asamblea nacional son inobjetables la otorg con la mayor a requerida la representaci n popular y la ejerce un presidente electo por el pueblo
6229455 va en el mismo dise o de los proyectos de 2001 con las leyes habilitantes que estaban destinadas a una mayor injerencia del estado y adem s lesionar la propiedad privada
6229456 aqu el problema no es el control del estado de las instituciones es la confiscaci n la ocupaci n de los espacios sociales y por eso se habla de un neototalitarismo que es distinto a la dictadura pol tica
6229457 que el mandatario venezolano tras decretar la semana pasada leyes que fueron rechazadas en el referendo de 2007 sobre una reforma constitucional inici nuevos pasos para implementar el socialismo en el pa s y lograr la reelecci n continua
6229458 el presidente de la rep blica con la participaci n del tribunal supremo de justicia han desconocido la constituci n vigente han pisoteado el estado de derecho han impedido el derecho a la participaci n han aplicado una sistem tica estrategia de desinformaci n han actuado de manera arbitraria ilegal y contra el inter s y la opini n del pa s
6229459 26 leyes que el gobierno aprob en las ltimas horas aprueban las mismas cosas y peores a las que el pueblo venezolano dijo no el 2 de diciembre

6229564 one of the most common situations for young children to experience anxiety comes at the transition period between leaving home and attending childcare or school
6229565 sometimes the excitement that going back to school stirs up is enough to get kids up and at em for the first few days back but eventually the novelty wears off
6229566 re establishing a schools back in session bed time and morning routine a week or two in advance will pay off in the long run
6229567 even kids that love school can feel a bit apprehensive about the first big day back
6229568 to help ease the first day jitters kids can check the class list postings to see which teacher theyll have and if any friends will be joining them in their new homeroom
6229569 both of these scenarios present a great opportunity to teach your child how to deal with disappointment making new friends and facing a challenge
6229570 sharing personal stories about your own experiences especially if they have happy endings will help your child feel supported by you and help them see these dilemmas in a new light
6229571 apprehension and anxiety about school will typically pass after your child develops a comfortable routine
6229572 many schools and teachers send a list home in the first few days of school so it may pay to hold off until youve heard from them
6229573 in the meantime stick to the basics a few fun pencils erasers and highlighters should do it

6229587 we need to run the football better weve got to get the offensive line guys going its tough when one of your starters goes down the day before and you put a new guy walk on howard barbieri in and youre trying to shuffle around a little bit
6229588 but we need to get better in the running game
6229589 the biggest thing is we need to get a push up front
6229590 we need to get 2 or 3 yards you dont need to get it all on first down if you got first and 10 to second and seven to third and manageable third and five or six is a manageable distance where you usually have a good chance for a first down
6229591 when you get into third and seven plus third and eight or nine it makes it tougher
6229592 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6229593 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6229594 it could be something like a convertible preferred deal that might end up diluting shareholders but at the same time the rest of the capital structure winds up doing ok
6229595 the market sees that takeover as further illustrating the guarantee of the government
6229596 what mudd didnt say is that the company is too leveraged to a depreciating asset housing and losses are off the charts and there are no signs of stability
6229597 that delay will only be possible if the gses continue to be able to sell discount notes and term debt at relatively stable spreads

6229621 the fcc acted to protect the rights of internet users and set the precedent that unreasonable discriminatory behavior like comcasts will not be tolerated
6229622 we commend the commission for stepping in to preserve the public interest and addressing the substantial threat posed by comcasts conduct to the open character of the internet

6229743 we are very pleased by this positive outcome from our ongoing collaboration with ptc
6229744 the development of ptc124 fits well with our strategic goal of supporting approaches that have the potential to modify the course of cf we are continuing to work together with ptc and the broader cf medical community to support the next steps in the evaluation of ptc124 for the clinical benefit for the treatment of nonsense mutation cf
6229745 the publication of these data provides clinical proof of concept in cf for the ptc124 mechanism of action in overcoming nonsense mutations as the basis for treating genetic disease
6229746 based on these results we intend to initiate a phase 2b study later this year to evaluate the clinical benefit of ptc124 in adults and children with nonsense mutation mediated cf given the potential applicability of ptc124 to multiple genetic disorders we have a pivotal study of ptc124 for nonsense mutation duchenne becker muscular dystrophy ongoing and are planning proof of concept studies in additional genetic disorders

6229894 during this time were not conducting arrests were giving people the opportunity to take care of outstanding balance without them fearing theyll be incarcerated
6229895 we didnt really have a sense of what was going on out there we knew there was a potential for a problem

6229897 im praying to become a heavenly comfort wife for you i feel so close to you
6229898 this compromise budget proposal puts our state on the road to fiscal sanity and will give california a budget that works
6229899 i have made it very clear that we cannot tax our way out of this problem i do not believe in tax increases
6229900 i dont want to go back and ask them for any tax increases they deserve better than that
6229901 i think it is key for us that we finish this year with victories and not another year where nothing gets done just because everyone is stuck in their ideology
6229902 i keep hammering away at them every time i talk to them let us get together let us work this out dont come to the table with the same stubborn position
6229903 the republicans came in with the mantra no taxes no taxes no taxes and then the democrats came in and said no cuts no cuts you cant continue this way
6229904 thats two too many we are asking that anyone who may know about this or may have seen anything that will assist in solving this crime to call the pasadena police detective section at 626 744 4522
6229905 the proposal put forward today looks remarkably similar to the plan the governors office has been negotiating with the democrats for weeks substituting one tax increase for another is not a bipartisan compromise nor will it solve our long term budget problems this budget proposal will still leave a 7 billion hole next year despite nearly 10 billion in higher taxes and new revenue increasing taxes on hard working californians whether temporary or permanent is not only unnecessary it is irresponsible assembly republicans continue to oppose tax increases because they will hurt families kill jobs hinder our economic growth and feed the democrats addiction to higher spending

6229909 its easy to overlook all the new ideas that are present in halo 3 and the remarkably robust way theyve been implemented in the light of its incredible success and its legions of fans this award we hope goes some small way to reminding everybody of them
6229910 to prove the point many games are now coming out with these features as standard in short halo 3 just as halo 2 did before it presents a roadmap for the way online will be integrated in videogames in the coming years
6229911 were trying not to provoke them otherwise theyll stay here for five to six months
6229912 both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increase and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6229913 were not going to let this aggression stand the world is behind you
6229914 we cant let a bully do this because if they do it here theyll do it other places and if we dont stop it here well have to stop it in a much more difficult way
6229915 not going to prevent the american people from helping you
6229916 all the infrastructure here is destroyed theres no heating for example and nobody knows what to expect in the coming months
6229917 they are really worried about their family members who are still in the war zone and their homes
6229918 it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died rather we should thank god that such men lived
6229919 contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen and then say what should be the reward of such sacrifices if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude than the animating contest of freedom crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains sit lightly upon you and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen
6229920 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6229921 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6229922 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6229923 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6229924 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6229925 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6229926 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around

6229930 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6229931 it is an event where the words of hillary clinton are probably going to be exceptionally important
6229932 what we have seen is the indiscriminate use of force from both sides but from the georgian side it was very limited to military action on the 7th and 8th of august
6229933 on the russian side the military action started on august 8th and continued certainly for several days and everything we have seen since then both the attacks by militia and the growing humanitarian crisis and the refusal by the russians to allow access of humanitarian aid is a violation of humanitarian law
6229934 naturally when you first hear stories everyone says children were thrown under the wheels of tanks and women were raped and were teenagers shot
6229935 but when you ask the specific question did you see it with your own eyes the answer is no
6229936 i have to acknowledge that the russian military was immensely helpful they have put up roadblocks to stop the militias and have offered some help to people

6229942 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6229943 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6229944 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century

6229948 during the time we have spent in the make up chair we talked about everything but the photo shoot global issues babies human rights
6229949 early in the game they made a lot of tough shots
6229950 we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and they made tough shots but sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6229951 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6229952 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6229953 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems
6229954 in the third quarter we said the first three or four minutes we need to pick it up a little bit defensively and make the extra pass offensively

6229959 more and more young people are participating in olympic sports said dr
6229960 and were seeing people crowd around big screen tvs to watch the events theyre more interested in sports than in cultural programs
6229961 this is the culmination of a 100 year dream to have an olympic games in china the olympics have had a feel good effect on chinese society which they probably will elect to keep up
6229962 with the sports infrastructure the facilities the coaches who are being developed here and the young people who will be inspired by these games we think this will be a formidable system that well have to contend with for a very very long time said jim scherr head of the u
6229963 in shooting we call it the home venue curse said wang yifu coach of chinas shooting team
6229964 mother tongue interference and home venue pressure are the biggest obstacles
6229965 there is so much psychological pressure on them that i thought more athletes might collapse she said

6229973 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6229974 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6229975 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6229976 for this generation of teenagers were not going to have data for the next 15 or 20 years on how effective it a cervical cancer vaccine is what it changes about the dynamics of cervical cancer how long the vaccine lasts whether you can then extrapolate this to decreasing screening guidelines
6229977 we need more long term data from this generation of girls getting vaccinates now to make decisions on a population basis
6229978 our main findings were that preadolescent vaccinating targeting 12 year old girls is fairly attractive
6229979 we found consistently that catch up vaccination up to the age of 18 was cost effective that extending catch up vaccinations in women to the age of 21 was cost effective when we made very generous assumptions about vaccines properties and that generally speaking the catch up up to age 26 was not cost effective
6229980 theres a lot of uncertainty in the data and we had to make a lot of assumptions about the vaccines properties
6229981 we made very optimistic assumptions and we havent looked at the vaccine long enough to know how these assumptions will bear out

6229985 we are unsettled by what appears to the exceedingly high rate of fatal job accidents at the project site

6229989 ive got a little tally thats been locked away in the back of my mind and were kind of starting to get there
6229990 its been a great effort across a broad range of sports and its up there where we expected
6229991 we had 17 athletes in top three in the world coming in to this and we hoped a significant number of those could convert that to medals and were getting to the point where a significant number are doing that
6229992 even those who havent got a medal have delivered courageous performances
6229993 let me clear that i do not advocate renegotiation of the compact
6229994 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
6229995 just because you know youre paranoid that doesnt mean theyre not out to get you

6229997 were not talking about short term here his comments are based on his fundamental understanding of the challenges faced by western states
6229998 the governor of california is advocating more storage but thats a decision that i think the state of colorado has to make and if the state of colorado wants it then i think we should see how best to finance it
6229999 in arizona weve had federal joint financing if its in the best of everybody certainly thats an option that needs to be explored but id like to see the state of colorado say that they need it first
