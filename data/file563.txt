5630001 the council has formerly accepted the date and were pleased the inquiry will be heard so swiftly
5630002 the people of kirkby deserve a final decision on the regeneration of their town and holding the inquiry before the end of the year will bring clarity on the future of this development
5630003 well now be talking to our partners about the next steps in this process
5630004 everywhere i go people have told me oh im getting nervous
5630005 they did it to john kerry they did it to gore they tried to do it to clinton they did it to dukakis thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern but they know how to run a negative campaign but im here to tell you in albuquerque that its not going to work this time
5630006 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5630007 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5630008 300 billion worth of tax breaks for the same folks whove been getting tax breaks under george bush
5630009 is calling you whiners this guy obviously doesnt pump his own gas he obviously doesnt do his own shopping hes obviously not paying his own bills
5630010 during bill clintons era in the 1990s incomes for the average family went up by 6 000
5630011 during george bushs reign in the white house we have seen the average family income go down by 1 000
5630012 at stake is more than the crisis in the caucasus but also whether russia and the west can share a core base of values to combat terrorism stop proliferation and promote energy security
5630013 the u s encouraged him without really understanding the nature of the person
5630014 e u is very uncomfortable with the fact that they have invested quite a lot in bringing georgia into the e u neighborhood
5630015 russias economic relationship with the west is mostly based on oil and gas but they want to diversify
5630016 we tend to put out this picture of hostage europe but it is not a one way street
5630017 if russia does not get these revenues then it is in trouble

5630020 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family

5630022 its an introspective study about srk the human being the actor and film personality hes openly talked about his life his idols and also about how exciting his journey from television to cinema has been he has spoken about his seniors contemporaries and has not made any controversial statements about anyone
5630023 the film is a classic and needed realistic background to support the script when you compare the budget of this film with tamil or telugu film it is still much smaller
5630024 in our industry it is the first time that so much money have been invested on shooting locales and international artists this is also the first south indian film entirely was shot in uk
5630025 com isso fica uma campanha de papelaria os candidatos t m dificuldades para passar suas propostas

5630030 i firmly believe that the kind of immersive interactive 3d environment that this type of virtual world provides has dramatic implications for those of us dedicated to generating interest in classical music at all levels including music education music appreciation and especially for the promotion of new music and living composers imagine being able to talk with a composer or author or music educator in real time from the comfort of your own computer this environment has the potential to reach out to the four corners of the planet and to make the world a better place one friendship at a time
5630031 its a new group of players and its a new start
5630032 there are places up for grabs and this is a good opportunity for players to make their mark we are missing a few players the likes of owen garvan sean scannell james mccarthy and a few others but the squad we have will form the nucleus of the under 21 squad for the next european championship qualifying campaign which starts next september

5630036 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5630037 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

5630041 a lot of people pay a lot of lip service to national integration i want to use music to pass the message across
5630042 people can know jesus through gospel music whether it is sang by a believer musician or a musician of the secular world
5630043 both have their messages but christian music can bring peace of mind while secular music is for pleasure and money
5630044 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5630045 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5630046 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5630047 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5630048 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5630049 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5630050 hay que ser idiota para venir a escuchar a alguien a quien han elegido en privado para que les robe
5630051 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5630052 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5630053 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5630054 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5630055 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5630056 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5630057 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5630058 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5630059 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5630060 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5630061 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5630062 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5630063 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5630064 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5630065 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5630066 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5630067 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5630068 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5630069 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5630070 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5630071 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5630072 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5630073 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5630074 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5630075 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5630076 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5630077 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5630078 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5630079 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5630080 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5630081 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5630082 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5630083 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5630084 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5630085 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5630086 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5630087 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5630088 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5630089 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5630090 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5630091 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5630092 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5630093 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5630094 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5630095 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5630096 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5630097 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5630098 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5630099 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5630100 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5630101 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5630102 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5630103 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5630104 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

5630155 haben die kreisstadt dietzenbach der kreis offenbach und das polizeipr sidium s dosthessen eine vielzahl von sozialen baulichen ordnungsrechtlichen und polizeilichen ma nahmen eingeleitet die das friedliche zusammenleben im wohnquartier stliches spessartviertel f rdern und stabilisieren sollen
5630156 wir m ssen aber auch in der zuk nftigen zusammenarbeit alles in unserer macht stehende unternehmen um dieses wohngebiet durch eine weitere f rderung des sozialen zusammenhalts sowie durch eine noch st rkere identifikation der bewohner mit ihrem lebensumfeld und mit ihrer stadt noch sicherer und attraktiver zu gestalten
5630157 das viertel produziert durch die vorgefundene architektur und bauform der siebziger jahre der architektonische fachbegriff f r diese bauform lautet
5630158 diese anonymit t aufzul sen und vor allem die soziale kontrolle zu st rken war und ist das gebot der stunde
5630159 in der folgezeit haben wir die ermittlungsgruppe dietzenbach den erfordernissen angepasst und neu strukturiert
5630160 wodurch die t terorientierten ermittlungen weiter intensiviert werden konnten dar ber hinaus haben wir mit polizeioberkommissar detlef bittner einen kontaktbeamten f r das spessartviertel installiert und damit den b rgerinnen und b rgern einen wichtigen polizeilichen ansprechpartner zur verf gung gestellt und gleichzeitig
5630161 uns allen war jedoch klar dass die polizeilichen ma nahmen alleine nicht ausreichen w rden die situation dauerhaft zu beruhigen
5630162 die wichtigen impulsgebenden und fachlichen beitr ge der vertreter der hiesigen polizei in diesem gremium sind wertvoll und unverzichtbar
5630163 dass die menschen im spessartviertel an einer verbesserung der lebenssituation interessiert sind und immer mehr auch bereit sind daran aktiv mitzuwirken hat doch die weit berdurchschnittlich hohe beteiligung an der aktion
5630164 es ist uns gemeinsam gelungen in einer kontinuierlichen mter bergreifenden und vertrauensvollen zusammenarbeit die lebensbedingungen der menschen die soziale kontrolle und den sozialen zusammenhalt im spessartviertel zu f rdern
5630165 dies zeigt sich auch deutlich in der entwicklung der kriminalit t im vergleich zu 2006 als wir noch 3 238 delikte registrierten wurden im jahr 2007 in dietzenbach mit 2 509 delikten genau 729 straftaten weniger gez hlt was einem r ckgang um 22 5 prozent entspricht
5630166 der damit niedrigsten fallzahl der letzten 10 jahre steht wiederum die h chste aufkl rungsquote dieses zeitraumes gegen ber sie stieg um beachtliche 10 7 prozent von 37 2 auf 47 9 prozentpunkte an
5630167 unser gemeinsames ziel die kriminalit t in unserer stadt zu reduzieren und die sicherheit f r unsere b rgerinnen und b rger im spessartviertel und auch in der gesamten stadt zu erh hen haben wir eindrucksvoll erreicht wir werden aber auch k nftig intensiv daran arbeiten die lebenssituation der menschen aber auch das ansehen unserer stadt und vor allem des spessartviertels weiter zu verbessern
5630168 das spessartviertel von heute weist bereits ein anderes gesicht auf als jenes der vergangenen jahre
5630169 zusammen mit dem kreis und der polizei gingen wir neue wege der gro teil der b rgerinnen und b rger des spessartviertels begleitete uns da sie erkannten dass ein weniger an anonymit t ein weniger an kriminalit t bewirkt und dies wiederum ein mehr an lebensqualit t bedeutet der aufbruch war notwendig der eingeschlagene weg ist richtig das ziel ist aber noch nicht erreicht

5630224 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5630225 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5630226 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5630227 right now the way were playing we get him out of there in the seventh or eighth inning he has had a couple of key hits for us hes not swinging the bat the way we think he can swing it but i think he has helped everybody out to relax a little bit at the plate and get better
5630228 we knew coming into spring training he would make the rotation
5630229 we slipped him right into the three hole and hes done a great job we watch his pitch counts and try to rest him but his stuff is as good now as it was early in the year it shows how hard hes worked
5630230 its a form of reverse evolution rendering the numbers of the best players with the best karma obsolete
5630231 this is the number of craig biggio for two decades he gave more effort and got more out of his ability than anybody in his generation honor his memory
5630232 im more worried about whats going to happen tonight really all you have to do is win the game and theyll cheer they want a winner we want to win theyll cheer if we win and if they dont oh well
5630233 its like man what was i doing last year ive watched my highlight tape i look at things and im like got it i come in here and try to repeat it sometimes it happens sometimes it doesnt but even last year i was looking at myself going ok got it id go into the game and i was able to repeat it over and over and over and over and over this year i just havent been able to repeat it over and over and over and over and over and over thats the only difference
5630234 defensively hes had some real good games yeah hes been hustling he does early hitting in the cage some days and every now and then he comes out and hits early last year he probably took early hitting hell maybe not at all hes never done that hes probably done more this year than he has in the past
5630235 ive been hitting with my foot in the air a lot if the foot isnt down youre not going to have a good swing youre not going to see the ball anything you can put with a bad swing thats what happens when your foot is in the air your timing is off when your foot is down you recognize pitches earlier you see them better youre able to make a better decision and naturally because you see them earlier you can put a better swing on it you have a better chance of doing something close to what you want to do with the ball
5630236 i think it is hard being prideful when you have a younger brother and a younger sister
5630237 your whole life is trying to lead the way and you have to share nothing is ever yours because you have to bring them in thats part of it

5630239 the surgery went as planned and annie is now recuperating at home
5630240 annie would like to send her thanks and appreciation to all that have sent their well wishes in the past few days
5630241 i should have been attending the final press blitz of the week but my back suddenly went into spasm last night giving me more pain that ive ever experienced in my life and a totally numb left foot
5630242 they are being very very strict about it weve been told that if we show any symbol of any sort we will be sent home
5630243 there are lots of issues about freedom of speech and human rights here and im willing to respect the rules
5630244 even if you have a bracelet supporting a cause you cant wear it
5630245 however they feel the olympics is about sport and not promoting issues and i understand that
5630246 my dad looks a lot more native than i do
5630247 his first language was french he and his brothers were completely bullied and ostracized in the schools they went to in northern alberta
5630248 none of the grandparents or great grandparents wanted to talk about it and when my father tried researching it the church in manitoba with all the family records had burnt down so theres a real battle even just to find out our lineage
5630249 my family is prouder of their heritage now whereas in previous generations m tis status was something they may have been ashamed about
5630250 before that i just thought of myself as a canadian athlete but hopefully now i can have some influence perhaps other aboriginals can look at me and realize how much is possible
5630251 it was the strongest field theyve ever had and i finished 11th but they denied me carding because they dont count world championships in an olympic year
5630252 when you consider she started out quite late as just an absolutely local player living in vancouver and now she is ranked on the international scene that is something
5630253 the first priority is to provide political and practical support to georgia the second is to ensure that russia doesnt learn the wrong lessons from the events of the last two weeks force cannot be the basis for the demarcation of new lines around russia
5630254 im not one who believes that isolating russia is the right answer to its misdemeanours i think that the right response is hard headed engagement
5630255 i dont want to suspend the nrc but at the same time its obvious that we cant have business as usual with the disproportionate use of violence
5630256 if we have the nrc and it doesnt meet after what has happened i ask myself what point it has i hope that after this meeting we will start talking again and the great powers the us and russia will talk again
5630257 moreover the longer the possibility of a change hangs in the balance the worse the situation will become
5630258 if administered effectively this change could allow first time buyers to supplement their deposit rather than pay stamp duty fees immediately

5630260 it was unfortunate laporta had to go down because of things that went on earlier
5630261 if the ball wasnt cut off it would have been a bang bang play and nobody would have said anything
5630262 we do not teach that in china or in the united states
5630263 it was a low blow to throw at his head
5630264 i think it was brutal to throw at his head you can hit guys in other places thats part of the game
5630265 thats baseball but you never hit the guy in the chest thats an illegal slide the umpire should have ejected him thats where the game got out of hand
5630266 the last one laportas beaning really bothered me i hope the fans dont get the wrong impression of the game
5630267 when youre not in first you pay attention a little bit sooner than you would
5630268 weve already started weve got to take care of what were doing but were interested
5630269 when you look at it theres time but at the same time you dont want to get behind
5630270 at this time of the year if you get five or six games behind especially seven its not like you cant do it but odds are youve got to really play good and the team ahead of you kind of has to fold kind of has to go through a bad streak the thing about it right now id say at 38 games a team that can get a winning streak going or can get hot thats a team that can put a good push on claiming our division weve got to stay with them
5630271 you should let it affect you psychologically in a good way like last year
5630272 having to watch the mets last year we responded and played well hopefully at this point two games behind well do the same we watch what they do they keep on winning we know we have to keep on winning its unfortunate that we put ourselves in this position but thats the position we are in so were forced to see what they do
5630273 at this time of the year when you let it slip behind its harder to gain ground so this time of year yeah you pay more attention when you are behind

5630278 about how our lives are often dependent on the perceptions others have of us
5630279 it had a successful production at the national arts centre but i want to add to it
5630280 i believe passionately in the relationship between classical and new work thats been true of the great classic theatres including the royal shakespeare company and the national theatre of britain for a long time
5630281 i made a dispassionate military style analysis of our options weighing pros and cons
5630282 musharraf never was able to fully deliver on his promises
5630283 our dilemma throughout much of the muslim world is that in the interest of security we tend to align ourselves with strongmen who meet our short term needs but not our long term interests
5630284 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5630285 the bottom line is that the top leadership of al qaeda has not only eluded capture they have thrived
5630286 musharraf was careful to give only selective support to the united states
5630287 i think the war against terror will in fact be pursued with a lot more vigour and a lot less political manipulation
5630288 the most vicious short squeeze woolworths takeover rejection highlights significant risk to shareholders from pensions

5630292 you will have to ask the club and the manager what is happening we have spoken but he didnt want to say too much
5630293 i am trying to get into the team but i have been fit for a month and i am just not playing any games
5630294 i suppose when the transfer window closes we will know what is happening and if i do stay i will have to see if i can get into the team because obviously i want to play
5630295 you could say i am in limbo thats about right i have come out here to play international football which is obviously a very good level and that can only help
5630296 we have a big squad at liverpool and there is a lot of competition for places as you would expect at such a club and it is up to me to continue training hard and take my chance when i get it

5630298 falta presupuesto y se han anulado consultas aqu en la capital la administraci n no puede mantener su demagogia y tiene que reconocer que la situaci n de este a o es dif cil y que los sanitarios tenemos m s carga de trabajo
5630299 para organizar los servicios se tiene en cuenta la realidad en esta poca es cierto que se han cerrado las consultas programadas de dentistas y en pediatr a faltan especialistas por lo que hemos suspendido el programa de ni os pero por contra hemos reforzado la atenci n a domicilio con una unidad m vil
5630300 tenemos quince consultas y cada una ve a una media diaria de 40 enfermos en verano la plantilla se reduce y m s este a o que no contamos con personal sustituto y nos organizamos como podemos
5630301 si a priori se ven menos pacientes en los puntos de primaria es porque hemos tenido que suspender servicios por ejemplo se ha anulado el programa de ni os sanos y ahora hay listas de aviso para las visitas a domicilio que se reparten entre las enfermeras de guardia
5630302 yes cnn wants you to spare them what is currently the most arduous part of what they do reporting and not just anywhere apparently they want
5630303 the most vicious short squeeze woolworths takeover rejection highlights significant risk to shareholders from pensions
5630304 me and eni have known each other for years were best mates off the pitch and obviously that helps on the pitch
5630305 it doesnt really matter to me who scores but we need to strike up a good partnership and with eni getting two and me getting a hat trick we have obviously hit it off from minute one
5630306 i was always confident in the partnership and now weve got a chance to show everyone what we can do
5630307 were obviously pleased with the performance of the girls and for me to get a hat trick on my debut is the icing on the cake
5630308 it is dreadfully disappointing for all the horses and their sections who have been looking forward to running and the thousands of race goers looking forward to coming to the city
5630309 the process went smoothly it was mediated by the french ambassador
5630310 we agreed on future exchanges if there are other prisoners

5630394 several times i have been sexually harassed and tortured by street boys
5630395 sometimes we are forced to learn vulgar expressions as a result of our exposure to insecure environments
5630396 i do this even during school periods i return from school at about 2 40 pm and start selling at 3 pm i hardly have time to do my home work thus my teacher beats me every day in school
5630397 my mother asked me to come and sell and said that when somebody wants to buy i should go and beg for wrapping paper

5630405 weve abandoned racing for today following 11mm of overnight rain
5630406 there has also been continuing rain this morning which started up again at around 8am
5630407 we will also hold an inspection at 4pm for racing for the rest of the week
5630408 we are looking at the feasibility with the british horseracing authority and other parties at staging todays group races later this week
5630409 he mesbahi is a boxer who takes his time and plans carefully he would not just rush into taking a decision
5630410 if we had beaten kenya we would have got some points and overtaken tunisia in the irb ranking then we would host ivory coast in kampala we will have to work hard since we are playing away to tunisia
5630411 i worked very hard so that i put up a very good performance and i am very happy
5630412 we are very proud of them they did very well and it has been a tremendous experience for them
5630413 like all sporting events we have a bit of an upsurge in the number of subscribers though it is not as big as one would have expected
5630414 i thought the olympics would trigger overwhelming subscription being the biggest sporting event however it is not as big as the world cup or euro 2008 business wise that is
5630415 we have event driven subscribers those who love soccer will switch on when soccer is there and those who love athletics will switch on for athletics for instance we are looking at different types of subscribers
5630416 we are not here by default and we are ready to face any team in the semi finals we do not plan for individuals but the whole team
5630417 there was no coordination in our defence because of the injuries which has crippled my team our strike force also had a problem and i believe that trx otlaadisa mohambi has not fully recovered from his injury
5630418 we have always said we do not have a problem with the people of zimbabwe we have a problem with robert mugabe since we do not recognise him as the president of zimbabwe so the zebras can go there and play
5630419 we believe that football can bring the people of the two countries together and reduce the tension which is there between the two governments zimbabwe came here early this year and it is important for us to return the favour
5630420 the good thing about this fixture is that we are playing a tougher opposition which will help us assess our weaknesses the other positive is that we will have our foreign based players for the game
5630421 of course and the pilbara electricity system is primarily a private one
5630422 integrating better the power supply in the pilbara is a sensible thing and its something industrys been talking about
5630423 the current situation in the pilbara is that there is no proper grid there is no linked up network available to new entrants wanting to buy power
5630424 up until now theres never been a network available that new customers could buy into
5630425 there are mechanisms available to government but they are long and involved
5630426 by far the best outcome would be to have a cooperative system developed where all of the major players acknowledged that there were major benefits for everybody to be involved
5630427 the current grid system has had a piecemeal approach and the government facilitating an integrated grid together with the main mining players should mean more efficient and reliable energy
5630428 es war eine gro e herausforderung sich in den stoff einzuarbeiten

5630434 no one we have has worked harder or had a better attitude he deserved this opportunity
5630435 i felt that if i got a chance id produce i realize that this might help me with another team if i dont fit into the plan here but ill say right now that here is where i want to play
5630436 including the one at quarterback ill probably just wind up going with my heart

5630497 with each passing day the administration is gaining greater justification to declare martial law especially if the hostilities escalate and reach areas outside mindanao
5630498 it is hard to believe that the administration has not foreseen the widespread opposition to the terms of the ancestral land accord and the corresponding milf retaliation

5630547 seeing such a long outage during the very first few days makes us wonder if a free solution provided by google is actually pro enough for us we cannot correspond with schools in africa or partners in denmark and afford being out of mail for a whole day
5630548 i can give them a lot of credit for providing a free service but they lose some of that when saying your e mail is totally inaccessible and were not going to tell you why or for how long its arrogant im a system administrator so i deserve to know a little more

5630586 we need a recreation area around here where kids can play basketball
5630587 kids drop out of school and dont finish their education
5630588 i think my daughter tried a little too hard to try to fit in she was an impressionable age
5630589 that seems to be like a normal thing on the reservation like drugs and alcohol and she was exposed to it more and i dont know that she knew how to handle it
5630590 we have a long waiting list of people waiting to go to treatment

5630593 getting away with murder 50 years of the armed forces special powers act
5630594 the indian governments responsibility to protect civilians from attacks by militants is no excuse for an abusive law like the afspa
5630595 fifty years of suffering under the afspa is 50 years too long the government should repeal the afspa now
5630596 violations under the afspa have served as a recruiting agent for militant groups
5630597 in both kashmir and the northeast we have heard over and over again that abuses by troops who are never punished for their crimes have only shrunk the space for those supporting peaceful change
5630598 the indian government acted with principle when it repealed the controversial prevention of terrorism act
5630599 it must display the same courage now in repealing afspa
5630600 but what i really want is something really and truly

5630604 but you with your saffron braided dress your flashy purple you live for lazing lost in your dancing your delight blowzy sleeves on your war shirts ribbons on bonnets phrygian what you are not phrygian men go traipsing over the ridge of dindyma catch the songs on the double pipe you dote on so the tambourines theyre calling for you now and the boxwood flutes of your berencynthian mother perched on ida leave the fighting to men lay down your swords
5630605 in latin poetry phrygian often stands derogatorily for oriental and thus for effeminate
5630606 ik ben al 35 jaar dokter maar dit is de eerste keer dat ik zoiets mee maak
5630607 omdat ze zo vroeg geboren is maakt ze niet veel kans aan de andere kant is er al sprake geweest van een goddelijk wonder
5630608 origin has rejected bg groups offer but has comprehensively failed to justify its position
5630609 we remain confident that our offer represents full and fair value for origins shareholders
5630610 forecast or other financial information which could assist shareholders in valuing the company and making a timely and informed decision
5630611 your directors believe bgs offer undervalues origins existing business and outstanding prospects and therefore recommend that you unanimously reject bgs offer
5630612 origin has developed the leading position in coal seam gas csg in australia and the strength of this position will be a key driver for continuing growth

5630627 las grandes estrellas del jazz como dizzy gillespie o miles davis sol an bajar desde manhattan al t rmino de su jornada para cenar en el restaurante de mi padre en brooklyn la cocina estaba abierta 24 horas siete d as a la semana yo le ayudaba y hablaba con todos ellos me encantaba estar en el ajo y poco a poco empec a tocar con algunos de ellos como kenny dorham o cecil payne
5630628 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people
5630629 i think that there should be no mercy for that we will do our best not to let this crime go unpunished
5630630 you just dont move more than 1 200 tanks and 15 000 soldiers into a country within 12 hours without previous planning
5630631 were talking about pulling our troops away to the borders of south ossetia they will not be on georgia territory
5630632 russians have committed to withdrawing and they need to withdraw and so that is what we are looking for
5630633 we were all set and then the georgians came up with a bunch of new requirements with no time for us to act so the time to exchange prisoners was interrupted
5630634 russian forces continue to consolidate their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia
5630635 you know long waits for health care and some services not even available
5630636 whoever the next president is health care should be at the top of his agenda bring everyone to the table and make it happen
5630637 het enige wat we daarmee bereiken is vertraging we zetten liever in op een zo goed mogelijke samenwerking met de gemeente we hebben de toezegging dat ze ons zullen betrekken bij de inrichting van het park
5630638 als je naar de grond kijkt en bedenkt dat daar huizen op moeten komen ruimte voor en achter en nog een waterpartij dan vraag ik me af wat er van het baanderspark overblijft ook zijn we bang dat de hoge bomen verdwijnen
5630639 its only natural to seek an arrest warrant as weve determined that a crime was committed
5630640 regardless of the differences of opinion it is unacceptable that those involved in whaling get injured or have their lives put in danger
5630641 thinking about the future and how the family will cope should the unexpected happen is a worry that can be easily avoided by taking out life insurance
5630642 she is obviously traumatised and very worried and is now focused on getting home
5630643 they now have to carry out tests into other areas to see if the cancer has spread into other areas
5630644 the government troops will continue to pursue and bring them to the folds of the law
5630645 i just finished downloading the new 2 02 software and i do not see a difference
5630646 disappointed so unless the 3g network is down at my so called 100 coverage area then nothing has changed

5630648 thats way out of proportion for even the dramatically unpopular windows vista
5630649 as the number of cores in cpus increases the demand for more and more memory inside microprocessors grows dramatically making sure that we can continue to grow memory on microprocessors is a basic requirement for scaling
5630650 um hello lets not do this lets just hang back and see what this is all about maybe next year i mean do you even know how to play soccer
5630651 near term demand for hot roles in it will be driven by the need for local and cross discipline knowledge changes in technology greater emphasis on managing risk and the enterprise and a limited supply of key roles
5630652 nearly all organisations now see the need to integrate information across the entire organisation
5630653 security roles have increased in importance as security expands to include risk management and requires an approach that considers applications infrastructure facilities and business factors
5630654 these roles deal with processes technology and vendors at the enterprise level and individuals with this experience are rare
5630655 they primarily focus on new projects and future investments in network technology
5630656 network architects also participate in annual budget reviews and oversee the testing of network equipment prior to moving it into production
5630657 capture the business process requirements from stakeholders and translate these into specifications that technical people can use
5630658 because this shifts the computing from client terminals to the data center architects are more involved with back end infrastructure operations elements including servers storage and the network
5630659 the demand for hot roles is tied to the technology aggressiveness of companies and their flexibility with sourcing
5630660 for example the importance of account managers is highly dependent on their knowledge of both their business needs and the capabilities and limitations of it
5630661 many of the hottest it functions place a premium on knowledge that crosses technologies management practices and customer groups

5630683 we chose mastertronic to help us with our sales because they have a great team with a no nonsense approach to getting things done and that suited us perfectly it made total sense to appoint the producers as our uk primary distribution partner as they integrate seamlessly with the mastertronic sales team and that can only be a good thing for us

5630698 this was a great group of kids and a great group of parents
5630699 very good hitting they play incredibly well as a team
5630700 for the last three weeks our offense has come a long way before that we wasted a lot of good pitching its a shame but now were wasting a lot of offense
5630701 but its mostly an issue when we cant stop the other team
5630702 almost all the pitches they hit in the second inning were good they just did the job they had to do better than i did mine
5630703 i came into the 2004 olympics just out of college
5630704 i was very nervous but i told people when you make the final anything can happen i had a far throw and nobody else stepped up
5630705 it is disappointing to know i had a legitimate chance for that podium my last throw i set it up i did everything i wanted to do and the disc just got away from me
5630706 i just came up short its always a learning experience and getting to the second day is an accomplishment for me
5630707 after about 15 minutes of video i started to walk back to the room
5630708 and who did i see walking in my direction gerd kanter that was a good sign for me
5630709 i dont think its a personal thing anymore i think its the team wanting to reclaim what we could have gotten in the world cup it has nothing to do with personal anything right now our teams playing out of their minds
5630710 ive never been that player thats been overly close with my teammates
5630711 we all are so busy im 27 years old we have our lives at home you come in and youre as close as you need to be to get things done
5630712 this new development is a critical achievement in the pursuit to continually drive miniaturisation in microelectronics
5630713 we are working at the ultimate edge of what is possible progressing towards advanced next generation semiconductor technologies
5630714 i misread the wicket in the morning there was something for the bowlers but i thought it will be just for half an hour or so but it went on to assist them for longer
5630715 moreover we were not chasing well for sometime in last few matches but all credit to the lankans they bowled really well
5630716 owais is going to bat at number three for the simple fact that i think he was wasted at number seven
5630717 hes a high scoring quick scoring cricket player who plays cricket shots to get boundaries
5630718 theres definitely a strong case for owais getting a good opportunity to bat and play long innings for england
5630719 i want to give the guys a good run at it and concentrate on a specific role so when something happens and you need to change at least ive identified the roles the players need to play and they can just slot in and slot out
5630720 its not a case of doing one thing on one day and another thing on another day
5630721 sehwags injury is bad and he will miss the remainder of the series
5630722 while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio fuel
5630723 but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic
5630724 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people

5630731 if anything in my life is positive in terms of business simon actually feels a pain in his stomach or his side if were in a restaurant simon will get up and walk outside he doesnt want to hear it he does not want to be around if a good phone call comes in
5630732 i almost think its strange that nothing bothers me whatever the joke may be i encourage it whatever it is im short im fat im tanned i encourage all of it i dont mind at all
5630733 i dont mind hard work youve got to work hard to generate something i dont think theres any secret to success if you show up in the right place at the right time and you put in a lot of time and effort and energy youre going to get something out of it its not brain surgery
5630734 its hard enough when its someone you dont know who is successful
5630735 happy happy birthday baby your just a sweet young thing well there is that dark side but you make the most wonderful goodies so whats your special birthday dinner going to be

5630742 happy birthday cathy i agree with you it is more pleasurable to give and this is a great giveaway have a great day
5630743 happy birthday cathy hope it is a great one a fun giveaway is a great way to celebrate
5630744 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people

5630750 russian forces continue to consolidate their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia
5630751 ringback tones are quickly becoming the golden child of the mobile music market due to a winning combination of consumer popularity and minimal impact from drm or piracy
5630752 the current leading mobile premium content category of realtones is already facing challenges consumers increasingly are able to create their own ringtones the price disparity compared to a full track download is also a growing factor
5630753 we will make arrangements about where to hold the protest once the police notified us that one has been approved
5630754 it has all been calm so far we have not heard anything
5630755 actually someone did come here to apply to protest with a form but i dont know where he got it from
5630756 we dont have any forms here we cant give any to foreigners
5630757 we didnt even consider applying for a second because for us it is clear that the protest zones are just part of chinas cynical public relations tactic
5630758 the protest application process clearly isnt about giving people greater freedom of expression but making it easier for the police to suppress it
5630759 we dont know whether it was a suicide attack but the bomb went off in the compound i have initial reports of 20 dead
5630760 we found absolutely no olympic fakes in the pearl market
5630761 well probably take a few pins home and i think the fuwas are really cute but that will be about it
5630762 its all pretty tacky cheap and cheerful trinkets but nothing youd really want to take home
5630763 freeing up the white spaces would enable innovators to blanket our nation with fast affordable internet access
5630764 it would mean more competition much better prices and a host of cutting edge applications and devices
5630765 its really a challenging time in young students lives because they are on their own for the first time
5630766 some kids who have been sheltered they find it difficult to just transition from having parents providing three meals a day to making their own selections
5630767 freshmen have a schedule packed with classes that makes it difficult to eat regular meals
5630768 i encourage them to look at their class schedule and find times to eat their meals its not a good idea to rush to class and not eat anything until 2 p m
5630769 i know a lot of college students really enjoy sleeping late and then rushing to classes but i think its really important to take time for that meal
5630770 they dont want to miss the social experience but i tell them they can enjoy their friends without eating again if theyve already had dinner
5630771 during finals we had an ice cream night and a doughnut night
5630772 and you can almost always find someone who wants to order pizza
5630773 i recommend that when they go to a dining hall they first start with a salad or soup
5630774 which has been shown to curb appetite and then later eat food that is more calorically dense
5630775 the hardest thing is to just let students know there are resources available
5630776 that there is a dietitian on campus that students can see for free
5630777 ill be 27 years old actually 28 depending on what the process is i am open to 2012 we shall see what the process is
5630778 it is a grind but i dont think that from what im hearing there will be another three year commitment or something like that he said
5630779 so i will have to see that but if its come to play and try out in 11 or 12 then ill be good for that
5630780 i wanted so much to just stay focused on this week there is a whole different set of circumstances if you win or you dont win to talk about a plan is kind of premature either way
5630781 i have thought about it if it happens the right way and we finish the job and how we might do it
5630782 i dont think its right colangelo said when asked if it would be unfair for the players to told after winning gold that there is a training camp next summer
5630783 we want to win and we want to enjoy it well have plenty of time to talk about it i need something to do when this is over so dont rush me it will be into next season before a decision is made the guys need to go home and rest and get ready for nba training camp
5630784 jag och anna hade helt enkelt olika syn p hur man driver en tidning

5630786 i also wish to extend my thoughts of comfort to his brother monsignor hubert coppenrath who succeeded him as head of the papeete archdiocese his nieces armelle and b atrice so involved in the institutional life of our country as well as the large catholic and christian family today in mourning a mourning that we share
5630787 they both were fabulous above all i admire all the work they have done these two promising young men had a wonderful future
5630788 a healthy spirit decided otherwise they decided to serve the country god and their people they took a vow of poverty and chastity thats fabulous
5630789 who have lost a man of great value erudite as much as a man of faith monsignor michel coppenrath will be remembered as a sower of peace with a rich personal career who lived his priesthood on all the worlds paths

5630792 the inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries
5630793 contrary to the vulgar belief that men are motivated primarily by materialistic considerations
5630794 we now see the capitalist system being discredited and destroyed all over the world even though this system has given men the greatest material comforts
5630795 history suggests that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom
5630796 a maior parte das canci ns que se escoitan por a non falan de galiza non falan de nada pr ximo
5630797 this is a credit to the hard work of our members
5630798 increases in assault robbery and theft from a motor vehicle are best combated by a visible and proactive policing presence yet hundreds of police continue to be transferred from the front line to desk jobs and other duties
5630799 decreases in unreported crimes such as drug offences are also a tell tale sign that there are less police on the beat detecting drug related crime and making arrests

5630807 nationalratspr sidentin prammer soll die alten sitze des plenarsaales die nach dem umbau nicht mehr ben tigt werden an die parteiobm nner verkaufen
5630808 da ja die parteien den kandidaten und unterst tzern oft parlamentssitze versprechen k nnten sie damit zumindest teilweise diese versprechungen einhalten
5630809 au erdem w rde das sogar noch geld in die parlamentskasse bringen in zeiten wie diesen sollte man keine m glichkeit zum sparen auslassen
5630810 und auch bei den erkl rten privatisierungsgegnern innerhalb der sp m te dieser vorschlag eigentlich zustimmung finden
5630811 langsam aber sicher r ckt die vp beim gesundheitswesen mit ihren wahren absichten heraus sie will unser solidarisches gesundheitssystem zerschlagen und die krankenversicherung privatisieren
5630812 betrachtet man die politik der vp der letzten jahre dann wird deutlich dass sie seit jahren vor allem die gebietskrankenkassen privatisierungsreif machen will indem sie den kassen immer mehr aufgaben und ausgaben bertragen hat die die versicherungen unweigerlich ins defizit st rzen mussten diese von der vp mit verursachte defizit re entwicklung versucht sie dann propagandistisch auszun tzen und forciert eine systemumstellung indem sie den gkks vorwirft nicht wirtschaften zu k nnen
5630813 der ruf nach einem vollkasko staat heute wieder sehr laut werde dieser vollkasko staat ist die falschest m gliche entwicklung die es geben kann
5630814 hinter diesen harmlos klingenden worten versteckt sich die privatisierungsabsicht der vp werden die krankenversicherungen privatisiert dann ist es vorbei mit dem solidarischen versicherungssystem kranke und alte werden dann wesentlich h here beitr ge zahlen m ssen als heute die leistungen der spitzenmedizin werden nur noch dem zahlungskr ftigen publikum nicht aber einkommensschwachen chronisch kranken menschen zur verf gung stehen mit der sp wird es daher diese verschlechterungen im gesundheitswesen nicht geben
5630815 ich fordere die sofortige aufhebung des unseligen beschlusses der post sonst droht boykott
5630816 menschen die 40 jahre oder mehr gearbeitet haben die ihre ganze kraft und intelligenz dem heimatland sterreich zur verf gung gestellt haben sollen nun durch die unselige entscheidung der post wonach geldlieferungen sofort eingestellt werden zu bittstellern der nation degradiert werden
5630817 mit diesem beschluss wird das kind mit dem bade ausgesch ttet
5630818 bedauerlicherweise wird mit dieser verantwortungslosen vorgangsweise auch vor der explodierenden kriminalit t in unserem lande kapituliert
5630819 dar ber hinaus ist es ist im h chsten ma e verantwortungslos betagte menschen dem risiko eines m glichen berfalles auszusetzen
5630820 sollte dies nicht geschehen wird man im bereich der seniorenverb nde zu einem boykott der post durch die senioren aufrufen m ssen
5630821 der start in die eigene familie und in die eigenen vier w nde kann wenn eltern und gro eltern nicht tatkr ftig mithelfen k nnen teuer werden und manchmal wird hier bereits die hypothek f r eine verschuldung aufgenommen die in den weiteren jahren in finanzielle schwierigkeiten m ndet viele jugendliche und jungfamilien die heute die schuldnerberatungen frequentieren haben sich nicht mit erh hten konsumausgaben verschuldet sondern mit der eigenen wohnung der notwendigen einrichtung mit dem auto welches sie f r ihren job brauchen oder auch nur dem traum vom eigenen haus der allzu leicht in die schuldenfalle f hrt
5630822 die probleme f r jungfamilien und hier besonders alleinerzieherinnen nehmen zu ihnen muss im rahmen der kommenden steuerreform auch ein schwerpunkt gewidmet werden nicht nur die bankomatkarte oder die kreditkarte sind schuld an der zunehmenden verschuldung junger menschen es ist auch das berufliche und gesellschaftliche umfeld welches ihnen vor allem beim start ins selbst ndige leben gro e kosten aufb rdet dann wenn am wenigsten verdient wird sind die ausgaben am h chsten hier muss es zu einer deutlichen steuerlichen entlastung kommen ebenso sollten zus tzliche f rderungen im rahmen der wohnbeihilfen angedacht werden
5630823 das verhalten von sp und vp in der gestrigen aufsichtsratssitzung der kabeg l sst einen handfesten rot schwarzen politskandal im landeskrankenhaus vermuten die dort stattfindende sonderpr fung und die t glich neu ans licht kommenden skandalfakten ber die inzwischen dienstfreigestellte f hrungsmannschaft im lkh klagenfurt l sen bei sp und vp hochgradige nervosit t aus selten zuvor waren sich rot und schwarz so einig dar ber jegliche aufkl rung zu verhindern daher stellt sich nat rlich die frage was haben sp und vp zu verbergen
5630824 und das ist wahrscheinlich nur die spitze des eisbergs wer wei was bei kommenden pr fungen und untersuchungen noch ans licht kommen wird umso verwunderlicher ist es dass sp und vp scheinbar eine aufkl rung der vorg nge im lkh klagenfurt mit aller macht verhindern wollen
5630825 sp und vp versuchen mandl und strutz zu eliminieren um den krankenanstaltenbereich rot und schwarz einf rben zu k nnen
5630826 auch das permanente sch nreden durch die vp ndert nichts daran dass die kriminalit tsrate in sterreich seit 2000 stetig gestiegen ist grund daf r ist die v llig verfehlte sicherheitspolitik der vp die gekennzeichnet war durch eine massive k rzung der zahl der polizistinnen auf der stra e
5630827 ihnen ist unser gro er dank auszusprechen denn sie leisten trotz widrigster umst nde und mangelnder unterst tzung durch die vp innenminister hervorragende arbeit
5630828 innenministerin fekter ist daher gefordert rasch zu handeln und mindestens 1 000 polizistinnen mehr auf der stra e einzusetzen die zeit der besch nigungen muss endlich vorbei sein

5630832 hier k nnte also etwas entstehen das noch zuk nftige synergien bringen kann
5630833 sind nun auf einer augenh he mit den anderen parlamentsparteien
5630834 wir haben in allen bundesl ndern fast doppelt so viele unterst tzungserkl rungen wie n tig erhalten die resonanz auf die kandidatur des liberalen forums bei den nationalratswahlen ist extrem positiv
5630835 die anderen fraktionen h tten auch die m glichkeit gehabt ihre kandidatur direkt vom volk mittels unterst tzungserkl rungen legitimieren zu lassen stattdessen haben sie den rechtlichen umweg genommen und lie en jeweils drei eigene nationalratsabgeordnete unterschreiben um dieses undemokratische hintert rl endlich zuzusperren werden sich die liberalen daf r einsetzen dass ab der n chste wahl alle parteien egal ob sie im parlament vertreten sind oder nicht die erforderlichen 2600 unterst tzungserkl rungen sammeln m ssen

5630859 its a red letter day for russell county but more importantly it is a red letter day for the entire nation
5630860 with the work we are doing today we are proving that coal has a future for many years to come
5630861 this is the largest and most prominent project launched in the central appalachian region to evaluate coal seams as carbon dioxide storage repositories
5630862 right now we are looking at all of the options to understand what will work
5630863 we also anticipate a major economic boost for the region through enhanced methane recovery when carbon dioxide is injected into unmineable coal seams
5630864 it is anticipated that an additional 650 billion cubic feet of natural gas could be recovered in our region through carbon dioxide injection the value of that resource would be approximately 3 9 billion in enhanced methane production
5630865 our region would also enjoy the prestige that accompanies the contribution our region will make to solving one of our nations most pressing energy needs
5630866 it is important research related to clean coal technology for the future and is something cnx gas is glad to be a part of
5630867 majorities in both houses of the congress now support the imposition of mandatory controls through a cap and trade program
5630868 both major party candidates for president also support those mandatory controls and the supreme court has now held that carbon dioxide is a pollutant resulting in a legal mandate for the environmental protection agency to regulate carbon dioxide if congress does not pass mandatory control legislation the epa will control emissions through regulation most interested parties would prefer that congress rather than the epa perform the regulatory function and for these reasons it is now virtually certain that legislation will pass the congress imposing controls during the coming four years
5630869 unmineable coal seams will be a major way that co2 is sequestered since there is a large capacity for coal seams to accommodate co2 across the nation and because coal seams are situated near to major users such as power plants and coke making ovens
5630870 today we begin the process of demonstrating to the nation that coal seams can realize this potential

5630903 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were every difficult dr forster said
5630904 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5630905 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5630906 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said

5630915 kenny is looking very good hes just concentrating on himself and his performance in the ring he knows hes going to have to be clinical but hes a better boxer than silva
5630916 on the law of averages youd have to fancy him
5630917 but were all only human here of course we feel the pressure and anxiety building personally id be happy to be heading home now with medals around their necks but you have to earn an olympic medal and thats what were hoping we will do
5630918 wed be hoping that kennys southpaw right hook will slow him down
5630919 body shots arent really scoring here and silva has a high defence so hes going to have to be very accurate from the off but he has all the skills and talent to beat this guy
5630920 kenny is the man he is at ease with himself and he performs best when he is happy
5630921 paddy is throwing three times as much leather as this guy but hes got to make it count his accuracy has to be good i felt he was very edgy in the first round last saturday after waiting around so long to get in the ring
5630922 bear in mind that three of the other guys had two fights over them before paddy finally got in he was effectively waiting around for two weeks and i think it put him on edge
5630923 maybe i was a bit too eager to get in
5630924 but i definitely feel that i can kick on now i know my fitness is there that guy was running away from me in the end
5630925 id never do that even if i felt i was going to be knocked out id keep on fighting i dont think theres anything in this division to worry me too much
5630926 i couldnt wear jewelry because it hurt when it touched my skin i had to put a pillow at the foot of the bed so the sheets wouldnt touch my feet

5631006 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5631007 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5631008 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5631009 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5631010 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5631011 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5631012 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5631013 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5631014 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5631015 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5631016 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5631017 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5631018 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5631019 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5631020 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5631021 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5631022 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5631023 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5631024 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5631025 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5631026 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5631027 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5631028 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5631029 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5631030 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5631031 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5631032 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5631033 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5631034 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5631035 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5631036 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5631037 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5631038 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5631039 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5631040 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5631041 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5631042 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5631043 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5631044 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5631045 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5631046 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5631047 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5631048 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5631049 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5631050 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5631051 in the film industry linux has won its running on practically all servers and desktops used for feature animation and visual effects
5631052 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5631053 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5631054 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5631055 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5631056 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5631057 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5631058 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5631059 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5631060 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5631061 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5631062 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5631063 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5631064 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5631065 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5631066 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5631067 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5631068 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5631069 who are open to doing something on the production side
5631070 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5631071 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5631072 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5631073 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5631074 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5631075 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5631076 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5631077 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5631078 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5631079 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5631080 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5631081 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5631082 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5631083 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5631084 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5631085 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5631086 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5631087 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5631088 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5631089 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5631090 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5631091 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5631092 graphic novels offer a combination of words and images that speak to us on a very fundamental level
5631093 in a way i think its storytelling at its most primal form
5631094 i believe in both print publishing and bookstores and i always have
5631095 but i also believe that obscurity is one of the hardest things for young artists to avoid by using a variety of online distribution tools as well as more traditional print publishing i m hoping more people will get to know both myself and my work i believe that this helps build a platform for my continued development as an artist and helps grow my audience at the same time im also very pleased to see that the book is already available through a number of channels notably online at both amazon and barnes amp noble
5631096 sometimes having a budget lets you hide the fact you dont have an idea
5631097 i have spoken to everyone in product design this week and told them that our product will have to become so good that it becomes our marketing we have to make it so well so different so insightful bring ideas to the table that have not been thought of that way our customer can tell his and her mates about us
5631098 given the choice of choosing between having a budget or having an idea i would choose having an idea
5631099 die entwicklung eines sequels ist immer schwieriger vor allem wenn man sich das wettr sten in der spieleentwicklung betrachtet
5631100 spiele konkurrieren nicht mit der spa igen erfahrung sie konkurrieren mit der anzahl der waffen
5631101 wenn man sich vorstellt dass filme so miteinander verglichen werden w rden nun nat rlich war schindlers liste gut aber dieser dreieinhalbst ndige film denkt ber den wert nach den ihr f r eure zehn dollar erhaltet es funktioniert so nicht und dennoch vergleichen wir es auf diese art und weise wir m ssen die qualit t betrachten nicht den umfang
5631102 so sehr wir auch nicht dieses spiel call of duty hat so viele waffen und dieser titel hat so viele waffen wie viele habt ihr spielen wollen man kann diesem vergleich nicht entkommen wenn man eine fortsetzung macht jeder erwartet mehr von einem sequel man muss es
5631103 wir f rchten uns nicht davor dass wir kein wirklich besseres spiel als gears of war machen k nnen ich wei dass es sch ner schneller spa iger und wahrscheinlich auch l nger ist aber dennoch mache ich mir sorgen dar ber nicht die gleichen wertungen wie beim ersten teil zu erhalten weil jeder diese erh hten erwartungen hat immerhin entschieden wir uns daf r in sachen umfang nicht mit uns selbst zu konkurrieren sondern mit anderen wirklich neuen erfahrungen
5631104 ungl cklicherweise war dies die sache die wir von den d chern schrien wir h rten also nicht auf uns selbst und sagten dass wir unser letztes spiel nehmen und es gr er sowie besser machen wir haben uns selbst vor eine ziemliche herausforderung gestellt nat rlich haben wir sie bestanden
5631105 unser fokus liegt darauf im laufenden gesch ftsjahr insgesamt profitabel zu werden
5631106 we have a few boys with premier league experience and they will help the guys like myself who have never played in the premier league
5631107 in many ways it is like the northern ireland squad we dont have lots of individuals our success will be built on working as a unit
5631108 we all work hard for each other and that is what got us the results in the euro 2008 qualifiers
5631109 obviously its dave healy who puts the ball in the back of the net but i think he will be the first one to tell you its everyone else working hard in behind him to provide him with the goal scoring opportunities
5631110 with northern ireland we have had to change how we play to make sure we achieve success and i will have to look at it for both my club and country this season if we are going to have success
5631111 the result maybe isnt as important as the performance on wednesday its all about getting the lads together and working on things with an eye on slovakia
5631112 its a tough start for us and our away form has not been great over the last few years
5631113 this wont really feel like a proper away game though and im sure it will give us the opportunity to implement things we will need to do when the qualifiers begin
5631114 its a derby too which is good and there will be a bit of banter and bragging rights up for grabs
5631115 my west brom team mate james morrison is in the scotland squad and im sure there will be a few text messages swapped before wednesday
5631116 hopefully itll not be like that every week everton are next up and the main thing for us will be to get some points on the board as soon as possible
5631117 i think we are capable on finishing in mid table but i will be looking for us to do what the likes wigan and reading did when they were promoted and we can then build from there
5631118 we cant play off the cuff as much as last season but what we do in training will be vital just like what we do with northern ireland
5631119 throughout this week i havent been able to stop watching the news ive never seen it like this before it has never made me feel so naked isolated and angry
5631120 while the conflict was going on in georgia i couldnt believe that the world around me was functioning normally or that i was functioning normally
5631121 especially doing these last two gigs they have felt very weird ive been removed from them yet have never felt so grateful and happy to be anywhere but on the stage
5631122 its also the road that i travel on every year to get from the capital to the sea towns
5631123 so for me the thought that this road is currently a danger and a menacing one is unbelievable
5631124 my mum and brother have tried twice to make that journey back to the capital but every time they have been turned back by georgian police advising them that its too risky
5631125 ten days ago i felt secure happy and looking forward to visiting georgia for the summer holidays
5631126 now im not sure what to feel all i know is that once georgia mends itself after another conflict in its recent history then ill never take that feeling of safety for granted and neither should the millions of people that live in countries of peace
5631127 as the attack took place in broad daylight it would have been witnessed by anyone who was in the ruchill street area at that time
5631128 officers are continuing to study cctv footage and speak to local residents in an effort to gain more information on this incident

5631141 it came at 2 02 pm three quarters of an hour into a speech that kept the nation on tenterhooks president musharraf bowed to the inevitable and announced his resignation here at last was the moment the overwhelming majority of the countrys politicians had been hoping for
5631142 most will wonder why it took the president so long some will rue the lost opportunity to impeach him what is incontestable is that the country must move on from this crisis quickly
5631143 the inevitable has happened left with no options president musharraf has stepped down

5631149 lillusione della democrazia nasce dallesempio della monarchia costituzionale la pretesa di organizzare il governo attraverso mezzi rappresentativi
5631150 dal momento che secondo lideologia dei democratici il popolo non pu governare se stesso ed costretto a scegliersi ei rappresentanti che governano per delega conservando per il diritto di revisione delle regole si suppone che cos il popolo sia messo nelle condizioni di essere almeno rappresentato e che possa esserlo fedelmente questa ipotesi del tutto falsa non c e non ci potr mai essere legittima rappresentanza del popolo tutti i sistemi elettorali sono meccanismi di inganno conoscerne uno sufficiente per condannarli tutti
5631151 affinch un deputato possa effettivamente rappresentare i propri elettori necessario egli rappresenti tutte le idee sono concorse alla sua elezione ma con il sistema elettorale il deputato il sedicente legislatore inviato dai cittadini per riconciliare tutte le idee e tutti gli interessi nel nome degli individui rappresenta sempre solo unidea un interesse il resto escluso senza mezzi termini per chi fa le leggi alle elezioni chi decide la scelta dei deputati la maggioranza la met pi uno dei voti da questo ne consegue che la met meno uno degli elettori non rappresentata o che lo malgrado se stessa che di tutte le opinioni che dividono i cittadini una sola nella misura in cui il deputato abbia un parere in merito arriva al legislatore e infine che la legge che dovrebbe essere lespressione della volont del popolo non altro che lespressione della volont di met della popolazione
5631152 il risultato che nella teoria dei democratici il problema consiste nelleliminare con il meccanismo della farsa a suffragio universale tutte le idee tranne quella che consolida il consenso e di dichiarare che il sovrano ha la maggioranza
5631153 in ogni sorta di governo il deputato rende conto al potere non al paese e necessario che egli sia padrone del suo voto che al traffico nella sua vendita che il mandato avere un specificato termine della durata di almeno un anno durante il quale il governo in accordo con i deputati fa ci che vuole e d forza di legge con un intervento di propria volont arbitraria
5631154 se la monarchia martello che schiaccia il popolo la democrazia lascia che lo divide luno e laltro concorrono ugualmente alla morte della libert
5631155 in virt del principio democratico tutti i cittadini devono partecipare alla creazione della legge e devono pagare tutti il loro debito verso la loro terra natia come contribuenti giurati giudici e soldati
5631156 se le cose andassero in questo modo lideale della democrazia sarebbe raggiunto la societ avrebbe unesistenza normale che si svilupperebbe direttamente in accordo con i suoi principi come fanno tutte le cose che vivono e crescono
5631157 completamente diverso nella democrazia rappresentativa che secondo i suoi sostenitori esiste unicamente solo nel momento delle elezioni e per la formazione del potere legislativo una volta passato questo momento la democrazia si ritira si ritira in s ed inizia di nuovo il suo lavoro anti democratico
5631158 in realt non vero in nessuna democrazia che tutti i cittadini partecipano alla formazione del diritto tale processo prerogativa riservata ai rappresentanti
5631159 non vero che essi deliberano in tutti gli affari pubblici nazionali ed esteri questa facolt esclusiva dei ministri neppure dei rappresentanti i cittadini discutono le questioni i ministri le decidono
5631160 non vero che i cittadini partecipano alla nomina dei funzionari
5631161 il potere che nomina i suoi subalterni a volte secondo lo far secondo il suo arbitrio altre secondo determinate condizioni di convenienza e propaganda perch lasservimento dei funzionari e laccentramento del potere richiedono che sia cos
5631162 in base alla teoria della democrazia il popolo non in grado di governare se stesso la democrazia come la monarchia dopo aver posto come sua linea di principio la sovranit del popolo si conclude con dichiarando lincapacit del popolo a governarsi
5631163 it doesnt matter whether its labelled as a friendly or qualifier a game against scotland will always get the blood pumping
5631164 its actually still pumping for me after sunday because i thought it was stonewall penalty for us against celtic at the end and i would have been so glad to take it to give us the win
5631165 i thought the ghost tour would have kept the adrenalin going but the ghost seemed to go into hiding when they knew the northern ireland boys were on their way
5631166 seriously though we are a proud nation and remember we are still the current holders of the british championship that is something we hold dear
5631167 ive come up to scotland from cardiff to play football this year and its all about playing games so im not overlooked when it comes to northern ireland
5631168 i know weve had a few withdrawals however all the remaining lads are focussed on putting in a performance and getting a result that would set us up nicely for the world cup qualifier in slovakia next month
5631169 i believe around 6 000 northern ireland fans are coming over so its vitally important we dont let them down
5631170 and it would mean so much for me to not only start but also score against scotland i havent scored in a while it seems like that goal against denmark at windsor park last november was my last goal
5631171 i dont care who i come up against all i want to do is play for my country scotland may have a number of withdrawals but i still consider them to be dangerous they have players performing in the premiership and spl afterall
5631172 we got some information and checked it out and gary has been confirmed as being free to play against newington
5631173 i havent decided what my line up will be we havent played a game in nearly three weeks and all the boys want to play
5631174 as things would have it i watched ballyclare play donegal celtic in a league fixture a couple of weeks ago and theres a bit of quality about them
5631175 its a big game for them with a scalp to be had
5631176 i had a really bad start it was very hard to focus when my competitors were gaining points on me
5631177 i wasnt winning at that point and i saw this big left puff and i went like here goes
5631178 i went left and moved to the front of the fleet
5631179 i am also very happy to get the first olympic sailing medal for my country
5631180 i was lucky because the second place swedish guy was very close to goodison so goodison was watching him and keeping him behind pity for him but it left just three of us for two other medals
5631181 we have been instructed by a large number of people who want to take a civil action for damages following the loss of information relating to them by police at castlereagh

5631234 you put the dysfunctionality and the sharp partisan issues together and the failure to get a bill is easy to describe
5631235 but to say nothings happened because of this money i dont agree with that

5631287 we didnt follow players we didnt talk and we didnt communicate
5631288 we talk about respect but when it is completely unfair it is hard
5631289 the worst thing is when you say politely what you think and try to understand the decision you get a yellow card i had a yellow card at the community shield the same way i say i respect people the way they respect me
5631290 we are supposed to respect the rules and the referee but it goes both ways they have to respect the players too

5631298 i hope the horrible image of me will make other young people think twice before they next use a sunbed

5631311 in una simile architettura i sever non sono del tutto assenti svolgendo la diversa ma pur sempre fondamentale funzione di gestire le connessioni tra gli utenti e lindicizzazione dei file e indispensabile infatti che lutente interessato al prelievo o allo scambio di particolari dati sia in grato di sapere se dove ed in quale misura possa reperirli nel momento in cui si connette alla rete mondiale accertamento precluso agli ordinari strumenti di ricerca che non sono in grado di documentare e localizzare il contenuto dei singoli computer

5631313 fosse un alias di thepiratebay org e lo oscurasse andrebbe tutto bene
5631314 lipotesi appare vieppi fondata anzi del tutto pacifica avendo riguardo agli assetti ed ai contenuti del sito caro in esame che programmaticamente non prevede alcune attenzione al rispetto dei diritti di autore

5631317 in relazione a tale ipotesi delittuosa tuttavia non vi sono attualmente elementi per ritenere la competenza territoriale dellautorit giudiziaria italiana la struttura organizzativa invero appare organizzata e realizzata interamente allestero in quanto gli apparati informatici dei server come risulta dalle informazioni di pubblico domino reperibili in internet sono stati materialmente collocali dapprima in svezia quindi in olanda a comunque al momento non vi prova di una loro collocazione almeno parziale in territorio italiano
5631318 non pu escludersi invece la competenza dallautorit giudiziaria italiana in ordine al reato di cui alla superiore incolpazione non essendo noto il luogo di consumazione delle singole condotte di illecito scambio e potendo ritenersi che almeno una parte degli scambi coinvolga utenti di nazionalit italiana o comunque operanti in italia il sito agevolmente accessibile da qualsivoglia apparato informatico collocato nel territorio dallo stato purch collegato alla rete internet e le statistiche danno conto di una diffusione degli accessi su scala mondiale

5631731 this study points to the beneficial effects of a married life
5631732 these findings are particularly worrying for the uk a society with a high divorce rate marriage at an all time low and ageing population
5631733 this is the first study of its kind to examine the link between midlife marital status and dementia adding to previous research suggesting that social interaction reduces dementia risk
5631734 singletons shouldnt worry there are many other ways to reduce your risk of dementia that dont involve popping the question

5631737 the work showed for the first time that almost the entire portrush seabed the shoreface was set in motion during high energy storms whereas at portstewart only the upper part near the beach showed significant changes
5631738 a beachs ability to retain its position is usually reflected in what happens on the seabed area out to a depth of 35 metres and this is seen at portrush west strand where the beach has shown instability over the years
5631739 portstewarts beach on the other hand has been relatively stable and this corresponds with its less dynamic gently sloping seabed
5631740 dunes which can act as a sand reservoir to feed the beach when required have long since been removed through human destruction at west strand so this makes portrushs beach more vulnerable to storms in the future
5631741 a great storm puts out a little fire but it feeds a strong one

5631743 now renegades are the people with their own philosophies they change the course of history everyday people like you and me

5631745 our modern day is seeing a startling reaction against authority an intense distaste for obedience this movement seems to be a natural outgrowth of our democratic philosophy when it gets out of control government is to be of the people for the people and by the people according to the democratic principle and this can be beautiful as long as it is operating ideally today however we are beginning to see signs of a breakdown in the process this kind of thinking can result in what the writer of judges described in those days there was no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes judges 17 6 the democratic system out of control can degenerate into anarchy the erosion of authority can accompany the democratic process when confidence in government declines as it has in our day obedience is lacking on the family level in the political realm on the educational scene even in the sports arena and in the church we have a similar situation people in our churches who profess that god is god and jesus christ the risen lord is his son are also reacting against his authority
5631746 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but the one who does the will of my father who is in heaven
5631747 hes always full of advice not only with goalkeeping but in life in general
5631748 whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil for the devil has been sinning from the beginning
5631749 he is the radiance of the glory of god and the exact imprint of his nature and he upholds the universe by the word of his power
5631750 therefore god has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name so that at the name of jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
5631751 you know that those who are considered rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their great ones exercise authority over them but it shall not be so among you but whoever would be great among you must be your servant and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all for even the son of man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many
5631752 serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation
5631753 for since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation it was declared at first by the lord and it was attested to us by those who heard while god also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the holy spirit distributed according to his will now it was not to angels that god subjected the world to come of which we are speaking
5631754 there is an admirable conjunction of diverse excellencies in jesus christ

5631759 la cultura de la rep blica y todo lo que se perdi con el golpe de estado
5631760 toda escritura queramos o no implica una postura pol tica el uso a posteriori debe ser fiel a esa postura pol tica y poes a tienen todo el derecho a tratarse y la obligaci n de hacerlo con un escrupuloso respeto
5631761 se equivoca quien piensa que lo ha politizado la posteridad

5631763 la imagen que recibimos de cualquier escritor en el instituto suele fundarse m s en el personaje que en su literatura y lorca no es una excepci n
5631764 y hay interpretaciones raras sobre su vida de las que me sorprendo much simo
5631765 manipulaciones folcl ricas como la de andaluc a de pandereta que no resisten una lectura inteligente de su obra
5631766 fue un rebelde apoy todas las ideas del progreso social lorca fue pacifista y denunci desde las obras de la adolescencia la barbarie de la guerra
5631767 tuvo maestros de clara significaci n pol tica como fernando de los r os particip en campa as del frente popular y firm manifiestos sociales y comunistas
5631768 le cost la vida hubo 5 000 ejecutados entre ellos el rector de la universidad de granada y el alcalde la desgracia m s natural era que el poeta fuera fusilado
5631769 junto con g ngora y juan ram n jim nez
5631770 fuera de las fronteras espa olas su nombre es m s conocido que el del mismo miguel de cervantes
5631771 a veces se le confunde con una figura folcl rica
5631772 supongo que influyen cuestiones como su fusilamiento durante un conflicto de inter s internacional ya que era un escritor reconocido internacionalmente en ese momento su incorporaci n a movimientos internacionales como la vanguardia y la admiraci n que tantos artistas extranjeros le profesan y le han profesado
5631773 lorca fue capaz de unir las tradiciones el cante jondo y el folclore con la modernidad m s limpia
5631774 un ejemplo de c mo ser local y universal a un tiempo
5631775 se hizo un buen homenaje a la memoria hist rica con el parque garc a lorca cuando el historiador ian gibson localiz el olivo bajo el que fue enterrado y se recuper un territorio fundamental para la memoria hist rica
5631776 lorca ampara a todos los muertos an nimos que no merecen un cementerio cat lico por su ideolog a en el momento
5631777 lorca representa la cultura de la rep blica que intent levantar las palabras frente a la violencia

5631780 is content to rely on the failed policies of president bush
5631781 is taking action to support american workers and american companies
5631782 everywhere i go people have told me oh im getting nervous
5631783 they did it to john kerry they did it to gore they tried to do it to clinton they did it to dukakis thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern but they know how to run a negative campaign but im here to tell you in albuquerque that its not going to work this time
5631784 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5631785 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5631786 300 billion worth of tax breaks for the same folks whove been getting tax breaks under george bush
5631787 is calling you whiners this guy obviously doesnt pump his own gas he obviously doesnt do his own shopping hes obviously not paying his own bills
5631788 during bill clintons era in the 1990s incomes for the average family went up by 6 000
5631789 during george bushs reign in the white house we have seen the average family income go down by 1 000
5631790 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you
5631791 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5631792 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5631793 before the obama campaign launches attacks they should stop and think about the amount of money that has been raised through convicted criminal and longtime fundraiser tony rezko
5631794 it takes a lot of audacity for obama and his spokespeople to criticize john mccain when obama was involved in a questionable home purchase with rezkos wife and years of friendship and dealings with a man convicted of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery
5631795 therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us let us fix our eyes on jesus the author and perfecter of our faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross scorning its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of god

5631799 i sailed like i know i can sail and i will be going into the medal race with the attitude of winning it there will really be no tactics just go for it the spirit within the british camp has been absolutely fantastic
5631800 i grew up trying to spot the otherness in whites such as janet on three s company or the star of wonder woman who it turns out is half mexican because i was hungry to see myself represented in a medium in which my kind was mostly invisible but that s not the only reason i make such connections on a subconscious level i believe that i respond to white society s rejection of blackness by projecting blackness onto whites the rationale is that if whites are part black themselves their racism doesn t just amount to hatred of people of color but to a sort of self hatred in this way it is easy to see how racism isn t just damaging to its so called targets but to society collectively
5631801 producer louise jeffreys is a genius in enabling work to happen we would hope this will continue into the future and we will be having more co productions together
5631802 i dont know the figures but it is a lot of funding there are a lot of people involved it is a big crew a lot of sound and a cast of 20
5631803 i did ubu at the tron a few years ago and that went to the pit the barbican were co producers then so i knew louise jeffreys from that although this is through a different route it is nice to be working with them again gerry mulgrew and anne louise ross played mum and dad ubu and they will be back for this it feels like a continuation of that project as well
5631804 so please say that youll stay tell me that youll never go away cause if you do im coming after you i said if you do im coming after you
5631805 en cuanto a la inflaci n no se ha reflejado en el mercado una dr stica ca da de los precios internos del combustible y por otro lado tomando en cuenta que los precios de los combustibles no han bajado lo suficiente los precios de los alimentos no han mermado as que no veo c mo se puede explicar el bcn que la inflaci n baj a 1 25 este mes de julio cuando las condiciones siguen siendo similares a las de los meses anteriores
5631806 y que de pronto baje a 1 25 por ciento no s lo veo muy mal calculado conforme a lo que nosotros observamos en el mercado

5631840 if the crude palm oil price is below rm3 000 a tonne it will be commercially viable but if it is more than rm3 000 it will be difficult

5631858 i hate his subtitle inner city schools and the new paternalism and i like his decision to refer to this group as the paternalistic schools even less
5631859 dont much like the label of paternalism and reject any suggestion that their schools condescend to students or their parents which some feel is implied by the paternalism label but its undeniable that these schools aim to change the lifestyles of those who attend them
5631860 as uncomfortable as it might be to discuss in public what these schools are doing is providing a middle class achievement oriented culture to children who come out of a culture of poverty and for that the schools should be applauded and emulated it might not be politically correct to use these terms but they are accurate and that should count for something

5631868 having the opportunity to know sydney and work with him was a great gift in my life
5631869 he was a good friend and a phenomenal director and i will cherish every moment that i ever spent with him
5631870 most of the great directors that i know of were not actors so i cant tell you its a requirement
5631871 its easy working with bob i dont have to be diplomatic with him
5631872 i know what he can and cannot do i know all the colors he has ive always felt he was a character actor in the body of a leading man
5631873 we started together in new york and he always excelled at everything he set out to do his friendships and his humanity as much as his talents
5631874 sydney pollacks immense talents as a director were only surpassed by the compassion that he carried in his soul for his fellow man
5631875 today weve lost not only one of our greatest filmmakers but a great human being

5631920 its hard for me and my family in this neighbourhood
5631921 were currently carrying out enquiries into how this crash happened gathering evidence from the scene and speaking to witnesses
5631922 this is likely to take some time given the nature of the incident and the diverse background of those involved

5631927 it would be easy to give in and let inflation get out of control thats what happened in the 1970s but it would be damaging and dangerous to the economy
5631928 all being well inflation will fall again next year and will be much closer to the two per cent target by the end of 2009 but that will only happen if people dont chase inflationary wage increases
5631929 everyone wants to protect their living standard but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs then well all be back to square one but with inflation still high
5631930 stop what you doing i pay good money for that cereal
5631931 your father eat all his rice thats why i have no pimple
5631932 we come to america for better life for you stop complain so much
5631933 hey let me get your opinion whats the first thought that goes through your head when a guy approaches you
5631934 alright this is a two part question i have a friend who is very shy around girls what would you tell him to help him get past his anxiety around girls
5631935 but we know now that no matter how far weve traveled down our own separate paths
5631936 keep your friends in your hearts forever because forever is about to happen in a couple minutes
5631937 i wouldnt recommend that if you have to go make sure you go during the day and only go to the highly populated areas like downtown
5631938 well actually it may be ok for you youd blend in better then me id get car jacked and beat upside my head or something
5631939 do you personally know anyone who has been car jacked or attacked by a black person
5631940 do you personally know any black people who have carjacked or attacked anybody
5631941 she called me racist i say this stuff all the time no ones called me racist before
5631942 we were just so close to a winning season to a bowl
5631943 and the memories of that of not wanting to make those same mistakes again really motives us this year
5631944 we had a few problems last year where we played the first half then were kind of lying around second half
5631945 we couldnt put it all together but weve got that under our belt now we know what we need to do
5631946 but once you get past that it provides you with an unbelievable array of learning experiences
5631947 everything that we talked about in the spring time we can relay it back to a missed opportunity last year
5631948 weve got to eliminate the self inflicted things the penalties that we control the turnovers that we control the ability to run the ball give up big play
5631949 thats us and that has zero to do with the opponent
5631950 ive always believed that butch davis could get it done at north carolina thats the reason we would hire him in the first place

5631956 it very much reflects the very relaxed and happy position the ioc is in in terms of how it views the success of these games
5631957 owing to past neglect in the face of the plainest warnings we have now
5631958 rowdy she has to stick the coding in the warm ups she completely forgot to close a bold tag if that happens tonight
5631959 i am shocked shocked that was clearly a square bracket when it should have been a parenthesis im just not sure the judges and i are reading the same sentence
5631960 i dont understand it there is something about the romanian fuggers that clearly appeals to some of these international judges and i i just dont see it im sorry
5631961 the chinese fuggers are so technically precise with their grammar they start them diagramming sentences at the age of three and you can really tell in how focused and technically sound they are elfi
5631962 the chinese have presented passports verifying that yang lilin here is over 16 as you must be to compete in international fugging competitions but as you can see she still has her baby teeth and she doesnt know who brenda walsh is i have to say i have my doubts the us fugging federation cant do much about it but we suspect theyve been cheating
5631963 this conclusion is key shes got one of the toughest in the world its a three and a half part run on sentence with allusions to russian literature and the plot of whos the boss and she even thinks they should name this move after her
5631964 team captain joan rivers has recently announced this will be her last olympic games elfi i think that has to have something to do with the recent decision to outlaw the f word in competition
5631965 the only chink in the chinese teams armor is this next rotation poll writing theyre not big on democracy over there and it really shows they have got to remember that theyre working on an international stage and because the government says so is not going to get them a high execution score
5631966 the chinese are also at a disadvantage tim because they get so few western television channels they do not for example get soapnet
5631967 and theyve only just added chad michael murray to their lexicon but if you remember the 2007 world championships the chinese placed sixth because they hadnt fully grasped what it meant and wrote a whole well played piece on the height of his hair
5631968 so it seems the american team may in fact have an advantage here
5631969 come on girl come on girl come on girl yes she is champion she is olympic champion i tell you what
5631970 oh god shes never going to be able to have children
5631971 we dont know whether it was a suicide attack but the bomb went off in the compound
5631972 delmarva powers generosity demonstrates a firm commitment to furthering the educations of girls in our community
5631973 that commitment is enormously appreciated by our girl scouts on behalf of the entire council i would like to express our gratitude
5631974 naturally very disappointing these things do happen but on average once every 50 pit stops or even less now it happened twice in the same race what is definitely positive is that we have taken 50 of all the pole positions this year and our qualifying margins are growing also we have made a big step forward to reduce tyre wear under the race our lap times towards the end of the races are continuously getting better now we need to have patience and continue to push
5631975 ford is a leader in safety and fuel economy not even toyota or honda can match the new escapes safety and fuel efficiency ratings
5631976 ford has more five star rated vehicles than any other automaker and weve committed to lead or be at the top of every segment in which we compete in terms of fuel efficiency
5631977 weve devoted many hours to analyzing and developing the body structure safety belts and air bags of escape and mariner for better performance in front and side impact crashes
5631978 weve taken our compact suvs to the next level of safety and have achieved better ratings than fierce competitors such as toyota
5631979 safety is a top purchase consideration second only to fuel efficiency so escapes five star crash safety ratings and best in class highway fuel economy i 4 manual are a winning combination
5631980 they saw the artificial lights and took the wrong route
5631981 the diners were at first quite curious and then someone alerted the coastal authorities
5631982 id actually pay to buy a ticket for that one
5631983 david robinson and karl malone and that was the frontcourt
5631984 who else was up there patrick ewing so patrick david and karl malone that would be interesting
5631985 the world is embracing the sport that the dream teamers brought to barcelona
5631986 and i would say the 2008 olympics really demonstrate that complete embrace
5631987 you know i didnt even dare to think about that
5631988 the question was one step at a time if youve been along on the journey sometimes you dont realize how far youve come
5631989 that would be a separate league that would be nba affiliated or nba sponsored but it would be independent
5631990 and it would just sign players for a very long time to come it would be at a lower scale than the nba but as the sport develops in china and as more players around the world recognize the opportunities of playing in china we see that league growing and strengthening
5631991 i think that that is likely to become a regular thing
5631992 coming out of athens there was just more of a focus at every level on the game and the representation of ones country and were just doing a better job collectively on that front
5631993 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden

5632020 by your rejection of the good news of jesus which we bring you have ceased to be part of the people of god you have put yourselves outside of his kingdom
5632021 hes a great guy but he couldnt even get the scoop on the results in his own state
5632022 he was just waiting around like everybody else it seemed like he didnt really have the juice we thought
5632023 bayh proved that he was bayh a smart capable guy who will never light up a room who didnt really help deliver a key state
5632024 you cant even compare him to claire mccaskill who actually delivered and really enhanced her reputation
5632025 to talk foreign policy despite her relative inexperience on the topic
5632026 shes kind of emerged from this as a name people recognize
5632027 we didnt know chuck could be such a team player
5632028 the no 1 role for wexler was as the top jewish spokesman for the obama campaign in florida
5632029 bold and dogmatic and willing to go into venomous places
5632030 i think he got a lot of national points for that
5632031 hes in the bayh school when it comes to exciting voters
5632032 i do understand why people would say he was a flop because he didnt really help in the primary
5632033 but we still have a general election to go and i think bob casey can be a tremendous help casey knows how to run a race in this state
5632034 a trend or shift toward a lower or less perfect state
5632035 why spend so much time testing something that has already been looked at
5632036 i need to verify that the bugs assigned to me have been fixed
5632037 i cannot believe that its safaricom price could not double on the first day of trading
5632038 there was high investor expectation in safaricom that a number of people took loans to finance their investment
5632039 when the price did not rise to expected level many were disappointed and are now selling to repay and live a debt free life
5632040 investors could have taken a short term view of the market
5632041 there is also a possibility a number of foreign investors are selling out
5632042 i have decided to keep my shares for long term returns
5632043 i paid off my loan using money from other sources
5632044 it is impossible to please everyone in an ipo and sacrifices have to be made
5632045 there will be reduced average revenue per user affecting the companys bottom line in the long run
5632046 despite the silence we see management implementing what is favourable to them while we are left behind
5632047 yes even we in the union are concerned at the delay in the implementation of the consultancy report
5632048 the consultant made recommendations to the board on several issues amongst them the method of exit packages for redundant employees and positions adjustment of establishment job profile measurements pms modifications and contract employment for both section heads and senior management succession planning staff retention strategy and permanent exit programme the corporations board was not comfortable with some of these recommendations and either rejected or modified them these included recommendations to retrench some staff
5632049 for example the establishment register was increased and recruitment for the posts is ongoing employees in redundant positions were redeployed
5632050 the only thing we know about africa is from nas in belly
5632051 our music went from the tap dance to the lap dance
5632052 i really thought they were dead the way they had gotten hit
5632053 based on what happened nine out of 10 times its going to end up worse than it did
5632054 he is a super kid it seems as though he made a bad judgment
5632055 and i cant imagine what the parents of those girls are going through we hope that everything gets better that they make a full recovery and there are no side effects of any of this
5632056 hes a person whos never been in trouble in his life in any way
5632057 ive read about headphones causing pressure on the eardrums but i cant live without my music
5632058 it depends on my surroundings if i were at home it wouldnt be
5632059 ive read about headphones causing pressure on the eardrums but i cant live without my music
5632060 at the end of the day all that matters is the length of time exposed to a certain level of volume
5632061 the general rule of thumb is if youre done with something and theres ringing in the ears youve done some damage and it accumulates over time once youve done that damage youre susceptible to even more damage
5632062 there will be nights where ill fall asleep with my ipod on
5632063 theyve got robotic technologies which they can use to monitor the seabed and they are able to use that as a mechanism for security purposes
5632064 its giving us the ability to explore scenarios in a virtual environment using real depictions of the port of sydney or the port of brisbane
5632065 its the first time that we have had these three dimensional models of our ports and then used them in a modelling environment to simulate security related issues
5632066 were seeing that when these ceramic flat irons are used at the highest heat settings and on a daily basis to achieve straight hair they can really take a toll on the structure of the hair and cause very noticeable problems that can be hard to repair
5632067 if you look at the sales statistics you see that people are pursuing straighter hair with more vigour
5632068 most people on tv and in films have straight hair and its a trend the public is trying to emulate
5632069 the problem starts when they do it wrong or too frequently and they cause a real mess that takes a long time to fix
5632070 wah agak lama mas karena sistemnya baru tapi coba besok selasa telepon aja mas

5632072 qui n puede reivindicar un derecho a recibir el cuerpo de cristo todo es un acto sin medida del amor de dios nuestro se or se hace l mismo disponible en su cuerpo y en su sangre pero no podemos decir jam s que tenemos el derecho de recibirlo en la santa comuni n cada vez que nos acercamos a l debemos hacerlo con una profunda conciencia de nuestra indignidad
5632073 recibir indignamente el cuerpo y la sangre de cristo es un sacrilegio si lo hace deliberadamente en pecado mortal es un sacrilegio
5632074 si tenemos un pecado mortal en la conciencia debemos primero confesarnos de ese pecado y recibir la absoluci n y s lo despu s acercarnos al sacramento eucar stico
5632075 funcionario p blico que con conocimiento y consentimiento sostiene acciones que est n contra la ley
5632076 si una persona que ha sido amonestada persiste en un pecado mortal p blico y se acerca a recibir la comuni n el ministro de la eucarist a tiene la obligaci n de neg rsela por qu sobre todo por la salvaci n de la persona misma impidi ndole realizar un sacrilegio
5632077 en primer lugar un esc ndalo referente a nuestra disposici n para recibir la santa comuni n
5632078 se debe evitar que la gente sea inducida a pensar que se puede estar en estado de pecado mortal y acercarse a la eucarist a en segundo lugar podr a existir otra forma de esc ndalo consistente en llevar a la gente a pensar que el acto p blico que esta persona est haciendo que hasta ahora todos cre an que era un pecado serio no lo es tanto si la le permite recibir la comuni n
5632079 si tenemos una figura p blica que abierta y deliberadamente sostiene los derechos abortistas y que recibe la eucarist a qu terminar pensando la gente com n
5632080 no tiene ninguna intenci n de interferir en la vida p blica sino en el estado espiritual del pol tico o del funcionario p blico que si es cat lico debe seguir la ley divina tambi n en la esfera p blica
5632081 por tanto es simplemente rid culo y equivocado tratar de silenciar a un pastor acus ndolo de interferir en pol tica para que no pueda hacer el bien al alma de un miembro de su grey
5632082 the process went smoothly it was mediated by the french ambassador
5632083 we agreed on future exchanges if there are other prisoners
5632084 of course we will have to wait a few days to carry out this six point peace plan
5632085 must do what is necessary to neutralize all possibility of revenge by saakashvili who is the aggressor
5632086 i ended up in toronto it took me more than 30 hours to get here but being part of the australian olympic team was just amazing i met so many athletes its a memory i will embrace forever
5632087 despite numerous remainders and notices to sue the defendant has failed to comply
5632088 dear gentlemen we have prepared a contract and added the paragraphs that you wanted to see in it our lawyers made alterations on the last page if you agree with all the provisions we are ready to make the payment on friday for the first consignment we are enclosing the file with the prepared contract if necessary we can send it by fax looking forward to your decision
5632089 i was very happy that the wildflowers were late this year
5632090 its so neat up here because you can go to different levels of the mountain and see different plants
5632091 the uk has one of the toughest borders in the world and we are determined to ensure it stays that way
5632092 our hi tech electronic borders system will allow us to count all foreign nationals in and out of the uk while checking them against watch lists
5632093 these checks make up just one part of britains triple ring of security alongside fingerprint visas for three quarters of the worlds population and the roll out of id cards for foreign nationals locking people to one identity
5632094 the british public rightly expect our borders to protect the national interest tackling immigration crime smuggling and tax fraud
5632095 our strong new force made up of 9 000 staff working alongside 3 000 police officers at our border has already had large scale success with millions of pounds worth of illegal drugs seized hundreds of weapons confiscated and tens of thousands of people barred from the uk
5632096 so the problem for the worldcon is not the expense but having to front the money
5632097 the best suggestion i saw in the recent discussion on the smofs list was sharon sbarskys idea
5632098 if the idea catches on then more spare scooters could be rented
5632099 ik kon ook blijven maar na twee seizoenen is het misschien beter andere lucht op te snuiven
5632100 door ziekte viel heel mijn voorjaar in het water nu probeer ik nog wat van de herfst te maken de vuelta staat nog op mijn programma en die wil ik zeker uitrijden
5632101 als hij ergens anders naartoe wil dan kan dat hij kan zijn vlucht veranderen als hij dat wil
5632102 wat phelps op de olympische spelen gepresteerd heeft is echt ongelooflijk

5632107 minder doden op de weg is een combinatie van vijfsterren bestuurders in vijfsterren autos en op vijfsterren wegen en wordt niet bereikt met alleen repressie en controle
5632108 er moeten nog diverse verslagen aan het dossier worden toegevoegd onder meer het medisch verslag over de verwondingen van het slachtoffer hoe dan ook had mijn cli nt nooit de bedoeling om iemand om het leven te brengen
5632109 mijn cli nt heeft zich onaangepast gemengd in een ruzie van een vriend van hem verschillende getuigen zijn het daarover eens
5632110 i do diet and exercise but this excess skin doesnt seem to go away
5632111 i had a lot of stretch marks hanging pouch and sagging breasts
5632112 he gave me and amazing body with beautiful curves and perky breasts i have recommended him to several of my girlfriends and they have also been very happy with him
5632113 i saw the schoolgirl and thought it might be good with her
5632114 a direct nexus between the specific issue that is the subject of the advocacy and a specifically identified employment concern of the participating employees
5632115 an employer shall provide reasonable unpaid break time or permit an employee to use paid break time or meal time each day to allow an employee to express breast milk for her nursing child for up to three years following child birth the employer shall make reasonable efforts to provide a room or other location in close proximity to the work area where an employee can express milk in privacy no employer shall discriminate in any way against an employee who chooses to express breast milk in the workplace
5632116 iguodala is a major and integral part of our team
5632117 he is not replaceable the way the league works and the collective bargaining agreement works this man was not replaceable iguodalas option was to play for the qualifying offer and then become an unrestricted free agent
5632118 we didnt want to even get to that we wanted to make a deal so that wed have him for the long term
5632119 we made a commitment to the city and to our fans that we were going for an nba championship when we signed elton brand
5632120 this to me was a deal that we had to get done along with reserve guard lou williams who signed a 5 year deal worth about 25 million
5632121 now we have a nucleus of players that we feel real good about we wanted iguodala in a 76er uniform we were going to make a deal with him and thats what we did
5632122 i think he has done a great job right now
5632123 i have been here a while so ive seen when they see rookies come in and catch a couple balls and everyone gets excited
5632124 i dont think its fair for people to look at it and say all of a sudden that he is going to be the next steve smith and compare him to some of the greats
5632125 you kind of have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted to this league i think we also have to put him in a position to make plays thats something this year that will be very important for us to get guys involved and call plays for them
5632126 the biggest thing for me every time i get an opportunity is to do great things for this team
5632127 most teams that we have played play coverages sometimes where they are not pressed and up on receivers like i said they are pretty much vanilla
5632128 i was like damn because i knew what was coming after that especially with what had been going on with him not running out a play
5632129 they scrutinize the small things here the way i look at it just play hard just play well all that is forgotten about if he performs well theyll forget about it
5632130 as of late its been all love youve got to understand the city hasnt had a championship in a while and the fans are very passionate about their sports ive learned there are things you just cant say even if the statement is right you can kind of get caught up in tough situations at times
5632131 there have been a number of times in his career where hes bet on himself on his confidence in what he can do
5632132 i dont like to talk about myself but i think ive done enough to earn where im at and that i have so much room to grow
5632133 im working on whats after this contract to continue to be a great player in this league i dont think you have to be a great shooter to be effective but you have to be a good shooter i work out every day trying to become a better shooter just like anybody else
5632134 if i improve every year i think ill be a shoo in if im also a winner the olympic team has guys who play well together they have some guys who have gone deep in the playoffs who have won a championship
5632135 i dont like iggy i dont mind the other a
5632136 it just shows the fans are watching basketball and know what i do i want to be dre thats it
5632137 if a referee is going to make a judgment ok but it doesnt make any sense that everyone would come over spend all that time looking at a tape that provides incontrovertible visual evidence that a butt caused the damage and then the decision is to allow the referees first incorrect ruling to stand
5632138 the first concern should always be to get the call right
5632139 a saga of bad or poor judgment dereliction of duty total lack of governance greed breach of rules and law gross negligence and possibly criminal acts cascading down from the very top of aibas former administration
5632140 said liukin who on different days competed in the qualifiers the team competition the all around which she won and the floor exercise before yesterdays bars contest
5632141 i dont think a lot of people know whats going on right now
5632142 i believe its correct to have two gold medals three
5632143 im very disappointed in that consistently it was the same country i think this was a different judge i dont want to go any further with that want to go ask her no idea theres not a single gymnast in finals from there
5632144 i know they were both from australia i dont want to start anything im just kind of stating the facts
5632145 if it had happened in the all around i would have been more disappointed
5632146 the chinese girl did an excellent routine and the girl who got third i thought got a little underscored its unfair to her
5632147 im hoping to get that gold i feel i missed out on today
5632148 hes definitely one of the greatest athletes ive ever seen in my life
5632149 its humbling for me and for kobe bryant it was unbelievable especially for myself
5632150 going against greece and spain those were easy to get up for this game it might have been easy to come out and have a game where afterward we make excuses but we didnt take a step back and it felt good
5632151 were a good team getting back to square one but its still getting back to square one for the medal round
5632152 the first thing steve and i do every morning once we have the coffee made
5632153 thanks for sharing and making the world a better place
5632154 the next best thing to sitting with a friend over a cappucino
5632155 it is painful for him but the pain is not in his leg
5632156 four years after athens his main goal was beijing gold and he has done great work for it
5632157 todays result is not perfect especially for liu xiang there is great expectation and a great pressure from all for the past 4 years liu xiang has been an athlete with great stability who never drops out of competition easily
5632158 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5632159 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5632160 liu xiang is a great athlete he stands the pressure no other athletes can simply stand
5632161 we didnt realize it was so serious and that it would cause the problem of today
5632162 we didnt want to tell people he couldnt compete because we didnt know at the time
5632163 it was unfortunate laporta had to go down because of things that went on earlier
5632164 if the ball wasnt cut off it would have been a bang bang play and nobody would have said anything
5632165 we do not teach that in china or in the united states
5632166 it was a low blow to throw at his head
5632167 i think it was brutal to throw at his head you can hit guys in other places thats part of the game
5632168 thats baseball but you never hit the guy in the chest thats an illegal slide the umpire should have ejected him thats where the game got out of hand
5632169 the last one laportas beaning really bothered me i hope the fans dont get the wrong impression of the game
5632170 its hard to execute because you need to be fortunate opportunities have to arise and we were fortunate this off season
5632171 basketball people in the nba have a high regard for andre iguodala because of all his attributes
5632172 a lot of people were saying gosh you turned down a lot of money last year but we looked at it as a challenge
5632173 together we had the belief in what he can do as a player it obviously worked out for him
5632174 i want to improve as a player in this city
5632175 andre had one guy guarding him and another four guys waiting on him
5632176 its extremely difficult to do something with that and thats why we made it a major goal of ours to go out and get that other piece to help us to help andre we did it when we got an elton brand type
5632177 zardari is not interested in the politics of revenge and is not baying for musharrafs blood like some pakistan muslim league nawaz leaders and partisan mediamen he wants this chapter to be closed
5632178 we are surrounded by water water is there everywhere and we have no one to help us no one has come to us for relief or rescue operations
5632179 we are ready to provide the villages with more relief and rescue operations the moment we get the orders to release the material we will release the relief material but as of now we have already given them four boats and have sent three more if need be we will send them more relief material
5632180 the coalition partners made a committee headed by senators ishaq dar and raza rabbani to work out the modalities for the restoration of sacked judges within a couple of days in accordance with the murree declaration
5632181 the government should reinstate the judges within three days lawyers would stage countrywide sit ins if the judges are not restored
5632182 as soon as possible and not later than three days
5632183 which rid the country of a dictator who ruined all institutions
5632184 this village does not have proper roads nor does it have any clean drinking water they drink contaminated water so when the village head called us and said that if the doctors don t come all of us would die we rushed to them immediately
5632185 it is looking like normal today i wish it should be like this now after 16 17 days of shutdown things are returning to normalcy i appeal to the people to maintain this atmosphere
5632186 today after 10 15 days things are returning to normalcy shopkeepers have opened their shops and are cleaning the shops if god s will things would be normal now
5632187 it s good schools were closed for long childrens studies were affected now the schools have opened we hope the situation remains normal here
5632188 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
5632189 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die
5632190 torear a mi aire ojal entren al trapo los enemigos sin ellos me quedo en nada
5632191 ricorder sempre quella sera al circo massimo la festa dello scudetto
5632192 they saw the artificial lights and took the wrong route
5632193 the diners were at first quite curious and then someone alerted the coastal authorities
5632194 het verleden telt niet in het heden maar argentini is voor ons een leuke ploeg om tegen te spelen we kennen ze heel goed
5632195 het is een wedstrijd tussen de nummer n en twee van de wereld maar ik denk dat wij verder en fitter zijn we hebben een hele zware poule ook met vijftien punten afgesloten dan mag je zelfverzekerd zijn analyseerde hij
5632196 we moeten de spitsen iets meer in vorm laten komen
5632197 ze hikte er ook een tijdje tegen aan maar dit had ze even nodig aldus lammers

5632214 elke keer dat ik mijn laptop terugbreng stellen de apple werknemers dezelfde vraag wat is je administrator wachtwoord de eerste keer dat ik dit hoorde dacht ik dat het om een grap ging apple is echter doodserieus
5632215 soms proberen de technici me zelfs te intimideren door te zeggen dat ze de reparatie niet kunnen uitvoeren als ik weiger een technicus probeerde me zelfs honderd dollar extra te laten betalen voor de installatie van os x omdat ik mijn wachtwoord niet wilde verstrekken de reden was dat ze extra werk moesten verrichten omdat ik weigerde mee te werken
5632216 dit is officieel apple beleid en het moet stoppen het is voor security bewuste mensen in strijd met elke logica gegeven de staat van os distros is er absoluut geen enkele reden dat apple toegang tot de bestanden van klanten moet hebben voor het uitvoeren van hardware reparaties

5632238 we used to have this season from october to april where we had a chance for a storm
5632239 when you pull the storm track north it takes the storms with it
5632240 during the period its raining less it also tends to be warmer than it used to be
5632241 were starting to see the impacts of climate change in the late winter and early spring particularly in the southwest its a season specific kind of drought
5632242 were used to thinking about climate change as happening sometime in the future to someone else but this is right here and affects us now the future is here

5632244 a shiite salesman was fatally wounded in an attack at a grocery store and was brought to the citys district hospital when there was a blast in the emergency ward ahmed said

5632246 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were every difficult dr forster said
5632247 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5632248 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5632249 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said

5632252 clean coal renewables and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future baseload clean energy mix
5632253 inconvenient truth that only nuclear power could provide baseload electricity while cutting emissions
5632254 burying mere tonnes of radioactive waste in geological stable rock was low risk
5632255 our view is that there needs to be consideration in australia given to the development of a nuclear power industry dr nelson said
5632256 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5632257 we cannot envisage any circumstance under which australia will have a nuclear power industry he said then
5632258 the last election showed that australians are absolutely of one mind about not having 25 nuclear power plants dotted around their suburbs and in and around their cities mr garrett said
5632259 are they really saying that they have a plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia where are they going to put them senator wong said
5632260 australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources we have a lot of solar we have a lot of wind we have geothermal resources she said

5632269 but it really doesnt bother me so much sides i gave it some thought and if we do we can just go home if it causes us any trouble its not like wed be stuck here
5632270 oh i was just saying that you seem distant like you seem like youre always in your head or something
5632271 yeah well you can ask my mom about that she knows why that is

5632284 with this additional system we will be able to increase the participation rate of women to the breast screening program to meet the population demand while drastically reducing our wait times
5632285 the more women we screen the better it is for the overall health of the population as you are well aware there is no prevention for breast cancer the best we can hope for is early detection
5632286 for the patient the test is much like conventional mammography but the result is dramatically different
5632287 similar to digital photography there is no film to develop just an instantaneous computer image that can be magnified to show microscopic changes in the breasts
5632288 images from digital mammography can be enhanced and manipulated by the radiologist for a more thorough evaluation like altering a digital camera photo the image can be made larger and the brightness and contrast of the breast images can be changed to help see specific areas more clearly
5632289 this allows physicians access to the images immediately following an examination and the ability for us to send images to other authorized health care providers in the province for remote consultation
5632290 patients dont have to wait in the hall and see if they have to come back in theyll be able to let them go immediately

5632301 wer neben fu ball formel 1 und tennis interesse an au ergew hnlichen leistungen in extremsportarten hat der wird von uns bedient seit mehr als 10 jahren ist es unser bestreben auch den trendsportarten eine weit reichende plattform zu geben und ich kann mir daher keinen besseren partner als unser vorbild sport1 de deutschlands gr tes sportportal vorstellen
5632302 in den letzten jahren ist die minenf rderung aufgrund von technisch immer aufw ndiger zu erschlie enden goldvorkommen sp rbar zur ckgegangen sollte sich dieser trend fortsetzen dann spricht allein die verknappung des angebots f r steigende preise
5632303 seit der gr ndung im jahr 1992 hat sich retarus stets auch als ausbildungsbetrieb verstanden
5632304 bereits kurz nach der firmengr ndung haben wir mit der ausbildung begonnen und seither auf ein ausgewogenes verh ltnis zwischen auszubildenden und fest angestellten mitarbeitern geachtet um den bestm glichen wissenstransfer sicherzustellen im durchschnitt waren stets rund zehn prozent unserer mitarbeiter auszubildende unsere erfahrung zeigt dass so die optimale betreuung durch unsere ausbilder gew hrleistet ist was letztlich f r den erfolg unserer auszubildenden ausschlaggebend ist

5632310 since dictatorship weakens a state and democracy strengthens it only a purely democratic government will ensure a strong pakistan pakistan is back on the track of progress now
5632311 is kashmir proof that separating populations by religion or ethnicity doesnt work
5632312 it doesnt help matters when a character who supposedly epitomizes todays intelligent highly paid professional woman is portrayed as mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another life style choice
5632313 a woman becomes strong in many other ways i would think you would have known that
5632314 liberal side i often find myself with the fence post stuck right up my anyway first we are all the result of our choices and our circumstances the problem is that many women like all other varieties of humans dont realize what all their options are so they make bad choices
5632315 lying to women about being whatever they want to be
5632316 its okay for men to remain single but not women oh no what other other stereotype are you going to drag out about women when it comes to that i can tell you one very real reason why some women remain single its the same as men we want to remain single because we can and its perfectly fine
5632317 you are looking in the wrong places to justify what is important to you and it is making you angry
5632318 if unprotected sex lead to death as often as it lead to pregnancy you could believe that more women would be careful
5632319 you are partially correct when you state that women put pressure on other women
5632320 its very simple for a guy to successfully date he has to date multiple women so he doesnt put all his eggs in one basket if he does he becomes desperate and if he loses out he gets upset women also desire men that other women desire hence when youre involved youll find more women being interested in you than when youre single
5632321 you just proved my point that society will over look a man dating multiple women but if a woman does it she is a starts with
5632322 i think there are men who are less than desirable if i concentrated on them then i would never be able to see a good decent kind man when he came along
5632323 the leaders will discuss the post musharraf resignation issues including the election to the presidency the restoration of judges and the political situation

5632329 tornadoes are likely in some areas tonight monday and tomorrow and maybe even into the next few days

5632337 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5632338 nobody is planning to withdraw the russian contingent very swiftly as there is no such necessity
5632339 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5632340 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5632341 in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5632342 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5632343 not because of its severity but because it has given rise to a new set of consumer beliefs

5632360 voter suppression and intimidation is driven by a desire to maintain the status quo concluded judge
5632361 these acts are carried out in an effort to deprive certain americans especially those most marginalized of a voice in our democracy election day is the great equalizer it is the one day where if all was right in our democracy it would not matter if a person is rich poor black white educated or not we all would have the same amount of power
5632362 do you want to split a dessert they look so big
5632363 i dont know what the viewing figures are for the bbc coverage of the olympics but i bet they are absolutely huge
5632364 i have been up every morning at six watching and i bet millions of others have i dare say im not the only person whos shed a tear or two of sheer delight when ive seen our young men or women winning i think it has uplifted our whole country
5632365 i have always taken the view that there are two things in life that for most of us are important sport and arts i dont think they should be available only to people who can pay
5632366 life is not just work there ought to be fun there ought to be sheer pleasure watching people do so well quite apart from participating oneself gives one that pleasure
5632367 there is a consensus that public investment has made a pivotal difference
5632368 perhaps the olympic metaphor should be applied more widely too
5632369 british athletes have won some medals they could also revolutionise the paralysing debate about public spending that has not moved on much beyond the 1980s a decade when apart from a few glowing anomalous exceptions britain won virtually nothing on any sporting front
5632370 i would like to express ads strong solidarity as well as my own personal solidarity with victor in 19 years of being active on a voluntary unpaid basis with ad while working with the government service as a teacher asst head and head of school i have never been asked to make such a ridiculous choice i am also unaware that any other officials below scale 5 in the government service and who are also elected officials in the pn and mlp have ever been asked to make such a choice
5632371 it is indeed ironic that in the case of victor we are talking about a completely voluntary role while in the case of mps we are talking about a paid political role
5632372 hopefully this is just the action of some overzealous bureaucrat trying to enforce some obscure regulation which had never been enforced previously and not something more sinister emanating from the opm i make a strong appeal for good sense to prevail and for the action against victor galea to be stopped immediately

5632403 its good to have a guide like that but we cant take it too seriously
5632404 chinese cuisines have so many varieties and even a guide like michelin cant represent everybodys tastes in food
5632405 later i learned that i could bring the exhibition to turkey
5632406 as a result of talks with the ministry of culture i learned that turkey did not have a beeswax exhibition or museum and i managed to open one after some effort i have visited every city in turkey and exhibited the beeswax statues of turkish or foreign celebrities for 8 5 years since that day
5632407 i spent the income of the exhibition to open a new exhibition as i earned more money i added the bee wax statues of celebrities in turkey
5632408 millions of people have visited our exhibition in 8 5 years the number of visitors ranged between 300 and 700 a day our guides provide information about this art and the celebrities whose sculptures are on display to visitors in no beeswax statue museum in the world are visitors provided information about the statues
5632409 i will open a museum in a shopping mall next to the istanbul atat rk airport in december i plan to display beeswax statues of nearly 100 turkish and foreign celebrities i cant believe i dared to initiate such a thing but i am very proud of being the first person who open a bee wax exhibition in turkey
5632410 the statues of ivan grozni who is known as ivan the terrible and dostoevsky which were created by the ethnology and anthropology institute by examining the bone real structures are also of great interest to visitors
5632411 i grew up in the 60s with the idea it was the most wonderful place in the world to live
5632412 one of the first mass cultural images of the south and of course its not the african american story at all its not the southern story at all
5632413 i felt like the lord brought us to shelby to do battle with our own pasts and with our own stories about our pasts
5632414 is a kind of a commitment that many generations of southerners black and white have made to try to have a multiracial democracy and try to redeem the u s constitution and the declaration of independence into more than words
5632415 in this story its human beings who are flawed imperfect and caught in a hard history and they are grappling to make sense of it and to fix what cannot be fixed
5632416 its not about saints and heroes but its about ordinary people like ourselves
5632417 we really have to tell the story and tell it in a way that is correct that is truthful and honest
5632418 hollywood has a way sometimes to kind of give people what they think people are ready for rather than what the truth is
5632419 it was never my intention to show the south at its best
5632420 i continually surprised myself in terms of the depth of the anger from the black community the depth of the frustration
5632421 i hope that what we are telling is a kind of human history in which we can see the faces of people that we know and that we are and that as we struggle to find meaning in our past that well manage to find hope in our future
5632422 that the four seasons is a hotel at an archeologically significant site in sultanahmet is a problem created by past governments so today no one can blame the hotel management if it had not been a hotel it would have been another building that would be standing in the same area
5632423 as it was being constructed workers had gone too deep while digging into the ground
5632424 this means the ancient layer that should have been at the bottom had been moved to the top layer which caused a considerable amount of damage
5632425 revolutionize the renewable energy industry by making hydrogen touted as the clean green fuel of the future cheaper and easier to produce on a commercial scale
5632426 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral
5632427 the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future
5632428 thin film is more environmentally friendly and we already have some thin film technology through chunghwa picture tubes so we can ramp up quickly
5632429 some people may say bad things about me even my own village is against me
5632430 it was an accident and my son had no right to humiliate the marabout by doing what he did
5632431 the day they took the marabout to prison it hurt me so much it was as if they had come to jail me
5632432 its my marabout that did this to me it forged me it allowed me to learn that i can overcome difficulty
5632433 i knew that he would be hit but i didnt think he would be hit up to this point
5632434 ask yourself what is this money used for the kids are not fed so its not for food they wear rags so its not for clothes they dont have mattresses so its not for their beds
5632435 this is a sham on a grand scale under the cover of religion
5632436 now that the law is here if you find someone or people smoking in public places just arrest them
5632437 our work is to put in place regulations and that is what we did regarding the public smoking ban police should help you with an explanation on the matter
5632438 these people are supposed to issue warning notices whereby after failure of compliance they notify police and then we move in to arrest the suspected law breakers
5632439 the police are well aware that when parliament passes a law automatically it becomes their duty to enforce it with or without being prompted
5632440 they are supposed to enforce environmental laws just like other laws the national environment management authority briefed them already and they know what to do there is no need for fresh orders from nema for them to act
5632441 have you ever heard of lung cancer cancer of the throat cancer of the tongue and bladder we see patients with such cancers and smoking is a risk factor to these types of cancer although there are other contributory factors
5632442 sensible and enforceable regulation that protects the rights of smokers and non smokers
5632443 the lack of mortgage finance is central to the problem
5632444 london in particular appears to be having its own special summer sale with over 21 000 pounds off in a month
5632445 there is a feeling of chill in the economic air
5632446 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment
5632447 those who have an eye on the fertile lands have made use of a different method to transgress the legal decisions
5632448 t gem will continue to have the operating rights to the agricultural enterprise while the immovable assets belonging to the agricultural enterprise will be privatized within a year according the decision by the prime ministrys supreme privatization board oyk hence the document which underlines that t gem will be eligible for the operating right of the agricultural enterprise aims at misguiding public opinion
5632449 the land will be opened to settlement in the aftermath of the privatization process in contradiction of the will of mustafa kemal atat rk founder of the turkish republic this process might in turn pave the way for the opening of the area to gulf capital and the construction of the hotels financed by gulf capital
5632450 i suppose anadolu group will also pursue a rarity strategy which is the proper one they may increase production a bit we could not produce even if we wanted to it depends on their decision but if i were in their shoes i would follow the cult brand tradition
5632451 the council has formerly accepted the date and were pleased the inquiry will be heard so swiftly
5632452 the people of kirkby deserve a final decision on the regeneration of their town and holding the inquiry before the end of the year will bring clarity on the future of this development
5632453 well now be talking to our partners about the next steps in this process
5632454 there are 3 500 eligible people who provide this necessary service for the alevis
5632455 this is an institutionalized service not a service which can be put across by just anyone and who might change their sides or does not have the eligibility for the job
5632456 no spiritual leader has been educated since the dervish lodges were closed in 1925
5632457 they are a whole different school we are different as well
5632458 those who have only been to primary schools cannot learn enough by themselves by reading randomly
5632459 the legendary information came all the way to today passing through the generations
5632460 all 12 imams each have perhaps 50 books we commemorate ali by only talking
5632461 besides well have a lot of people competent on the subject h seyin hatemi many spiritual leaders and poets and i will be teaching
5632462 he is not the right type of spiritual leader approved neither by alevis nor by the bekta is
5632463 fermani altun tries to benefit himself from such actions the politicians use him and he sets up such a game by using the politicians
5632464 bashir was invited to the summit as a leader of an african country and there is no arrest warrant against him at this moment if there are any requests we will evaluate them then
5632465 the turkish government should reject efforts by sudans president omar bashir to secure a suspension of the international criminal courts investigation against him
5632466 the international community has spoken through the international criminal court concerning the charges of genocide against al bashir we would be very happy if turkey would join the international community in their comdemnation of him
5632467 this simulation is not a major earthquake because our goal is not to scare people but to remind them that we live in a country in which earthquakes may happen anytime and we should be prepared for this
5632468 that experience will not impress people we take lessons from a disaster only after we really experience it
5632469 people have much false information about what to do in case of an earthquake
5632470 standing under the doorway is a commonly held false belief but it works only in some old houses
5632471 find the safest place in their house and agree to wait there until the earthquake stops
5632472 the first thing is to sit on the floor near furniture which might be undamaged and protect your head
5632473 around 30 percent of the injuries in the 1999 g lc k earthquake happened because of furniture
5632474 i favor a brand new constitution of 2008 or 2009 but if this is not possible we still need to start a discussion on constitutional changes that could accelerate turkeys modernization process
5632475 i will go to tehran in 15 days foreign minister ali babacan will also be there we will continue important negotiations during the month we hope to clarify results from our initiatives during this period
5632476 turkey is a country dependent on natural gas we protect our interests here we have to make the relevant investments there are technical matters we shall discuss there are no simple solutions to difficult questions but our priority is security of energy supply
5632477 even during the war turkeys agenda was not the caucasus but instead iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejads visit to turkey
5632478 this takes us to a very important question that we cannot answer
5632479 if you are not strong things you say carry less weight
5632480 the buying is a normal reaction to the sharp drops across the region
5632481 valuations are attractive in some parts of the gulf as a result
5632482 the worsening economic outlook suggests that oil prices have further to fall but opec whose members are due to meet in early september may act to prevent them from falling too far
5632483 there is a danger though that the organization will over react cut its production too sharply and send oil prices back up
5632484 the cges believes that opec member countries facing increased government spending and rising inflation will not be happy to see prices fall far below 100 dollars per barrel
5632485 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts
5632486 we had no supplies no food and very little water we lost everything
5632487 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5632488 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5632489 were very excited to be working with apple to bring the iphone 3g to turkey
5632490 iphone 3g represents the ultimate in mobile device technologies and we cant wait to offer this innovative product to millions of mobile customers later this year
5632491 when the market turns around you must have the product
5632492 the decline in the oil prices affected the stock exchange positively
5632493 mkb will pass above the 41 000 level this week and the sales may surpass 43 200 points
5632494 the central bank does not expect a rise in inflation
5632495 this week we may face reaction purchases while the u s dollar keeps its strong position
5632496 the u s dollar may sway in range between ytl 1 16 and 1 20 this week
5632497 due to high tax rates we cannot talk about an accurate competitiveness in the sector
5632498 there is a 50 to 60 percent tax burden over the sector after additional obligations such as distributors share and the profit range of t pra are excluded the remaining profit margin of the supplier totals just 5 or 6 percent
5632499 how could we profit with this narrow margin while other sector members are in a great competition in terms of special offers to their retail customers we do not have a profit margin in this case
5632500 the high tax rates damage the competitiveness ruin the market structure and fosters illegal trade
5632501 in order to have a clear and transparent market the figures for sales which is between t pra and the main retailers should be disclosed t pra does not reveal the sales figures because of its privacy policy but this is against petroleum market code article 5015
5632502 turkey is the most expensive country in terms of oil and it is the third most expensive one in fuel oil prices
5632503 in order to decrease the prices we should first focus on the tax rates the high rates have fostered an illegal oil trade for many years but the taxes have stayed put
5632504 actually there is considerable competitiveness in the market in terms of the special offers to retail customers perhaps we should express this to the epdk slightly better
5632505 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5632506 the safir ambassador satellite carrier was launched today sunday and for the first time we successfully launched a dummy satellite into orbit
5632507 sanctions have not isolated us instead we have become more independent
5632508 our boxers won 14 bouts in sydney in 2000 but could not win a medal
5632509 we did not win as many bouts here but managed a medal
5632510 im very happy to be number one but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too
5632511 i was very happy being the number two so finally im number one for sure theres satisfaction but at the same time i dont know i dont have time to celebrate i play new york in one week
5632512 i just want to enjoy this moment because im having an unbelievable year
5632513 its more than my best dreams so i want to enjoy the moment
5632514 thats what i expected and hoped for many years ago when i got to number one that if ever somebody were to take it away from me he would have to play an incredible tennis schedule win the biggest tournaments dominate the game basically and then like this he can take number one
5632515 i didnt want it to happen that i would play completely bad and somebody would pick up number one in the world so i think rafa totally deserves it
5632516 when you talk to iranians you should avoid ambiguity and be direct to them otherwise they will interpret the messages the way it suits them the best
5632517 those western countries who are in the anti iranian camp in the nuclear row dont refrain from advancing their trade deals with tehran
5632518 at least we did our share of responsibility and told our neighbor of the consequences of their stance
5632519 i hope it is the beginning of good races said vos speaking as her compatriots theo bos and teun mulder competed in the quarterfinals of the mens sprints
5632520 i think the suit has changed things a little bit but good people are great no matter what
5632521 people have been looking for reasons why performances have been so good the real reason is that swimmers are swimming really well and the coaches are coaching really well
5632522 i remember the four minute mile being broken by the time the year was out five or six people had done it
5632523 we are calling it the swimming temple of the world
5632524 the venue is without any doubt one of the best in the world
5632525 athletes wearing different brands of suits can get up and win medals
5632526 phelps breaststroker kosuke kitajima and park tae hwan south koreas 400m freestyle winner all wore trousers instead of full body suits
5632527 i just dont think you can point to one factor its impossible
5632528 i think its a factor of theres so many people there athletes know if ive want to stay there ive got to keep up
5632529 according to the constitution i must protect the life and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are
5632530 assured that georgians will not continue to use military force
5632531 liu xiang would never have pulled out unless the pain was intolerable
5632532 i just came here to compete and take the gold
5632533 today monday according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5632534 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5632535 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5632536 the situation still remains unchanged we see no signs of a pullout
5632537 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5632538 sometimes i think that i should do something to steer the country out of crisis but also i think that i should not do anything which prolongs the uncertainty
5632539 all dictators eventually think that they are the savior that without them the state will collapse and that they are destined to play that role
5632540 my bluntness and indiscipline landed me in many a serious trouble
5632541 im proud to be one of the longest serving neighborhood heads in turkey
5632542 i feel healthy despite my age and thats why i do not get tired doing my job i try to help the residents of kesikkap whether it is day or night and i plan to continue to do so until i am dead
5632543 he does not visit us in our homes like his opponents but we vote for him because we are very happy with him
5632544 ku adas port offers one of the most qualified services among all the ports in the world
5632545 in 2007 600 00 passengers in 615 ships arrived at the port
5632546 and the port provides that the feedback we receive from the captains of ships is very positive
5632547 i have had a nice time in zmir and im sad for leaving this city
5632548 we already have flights from bursa to erzurum trabzon and diyarbak r and we are happy to add two more destinations
5632549 with its strong economy and tourism opportunities bursa has a high potential for commercial flights i believe that the new flights will contribute to the tourism and trade potential between the cities
5632550 the new marina will highly contribute to the great history and unique architectural structure of e me besides itll be in the center of the marina and yachting sector in the aegean and mediterranean basins
5632551 were satisfied to make investments in such an important spot because e me is the jewel of turkish coasts with its location were working to convert e me marina into a great place to live making it unique among the other marinas in the aegean and mediterranean
5632552 i really want to see petra and then egypt if possible
5632553 i think they have all been stolen from the u k and germany
5632554 i did 4 500 miles last year in america from yorktown down and they only give you a 93 day visa so we had to average 46 miles a day
5632555 this project will be implemented to help cyprus fight drought and carry out irrigated farming
5632556 an intensive effort is underway production will begin again in a few days if there are no problems
5632557 more than 100 percent overbooking from day one in 2013 shows huge demand for the provided nabucco capacities on a strong growing gas market
5632558 parliament has no right to make a statement on the content of the assets declared by the deputies except for officials who are obliged to carry out an investigation and prosecution in line with article 15 of the law on the declaration of lists of assets by the council cabinet
5632559 parliament is thus not authorized to reveal the assets of the deputy in question in a legal sense
5632560 turkish pakistani relations are so unique that they cannot be compared with any country
5632561 we hope that stability welfare and unity will prevail in pakistan in the upcoming period turkey will always support pakistan
5632562 i see the resignation as a timely and virtuous act on the part of mr musharraf otherwise pakistan was going to plunge into chaos
5632563 the biggest fear for pakistan is the collapse of the system and the country turning into afghanistan
5632564 if pakistan is not supported by the united states in the upcoming period a frenzy of extremism and terrorism is bound to escalate
5632565 pakistan is not like afghanistan and the likelihood of rising extremism in pakistan will undoubtedly affect the entire muslim world
5632566 i hope that a secular democratic regime will prevail in pakistan an al qaeda type dominance in the country would be a nightmare for the world
5632567 all political actors in pakistan including the opposition listen to what turkey says
5632568 turkey does not look to pakistan as a foreign country because turkish pakistani ties are not periodic but traditional
5632569 with globalization as well as turkeys greater self confidence as a regional power ankara was bound to increase its network of cooperation in remote locations
5632570 the new ground of competition among global powers will be africa
5632571 of course there are differences between todays turkey and the country five years ago but still the regulations and deterrence are not sufficient
5632572 other countries especially the united states step forward with new legislation today american companies not only launch financial investigations but also search if any bribery was practiced in the company and if their reputation would defame the partnership turkey needs to reach this level
5632573 mr emie wants to transform the last section of istanbul into a bosporus show by eu ambassadors we are currently in contact with them
5632574 there has been 100 percent increase in participation this is partly due to people learning that the mediterranean is a great racetrack for professional sailing
5632575 but i think turkeys eu accession efforts are at least as responsible for the increased attention to our race
5632576 these firms would not spend this much money for the race if they had not made plans to invest in turkey
5632577 we cant give people so much security with their income that it affects their willingness to work
5632578 we can have equality in access to education and health but not in equality of income
5632579 when the economy recovers you realise that there is a level of protection that has to change we cant have a situation where it is not work that gives access to goods

5632582 our goal all along has been to help users manage their online social lives from the handset and this award shows that we have done that better than anyone else in the industry
5632583 about 70 percent of the fishermen in our village lost money in the first half of this year
5632584 some have quit and survive on the fee from selling their boats for scrap
5632585 this will add to the pressure on millions of chinese fishermen and farmers suffering because they have to pay more for raw materials
5632586 the government has said there will be some subsidy but nobody knows when we will get it or how much it will be
5632587 even though the government scrapped the agricultural tax two years ago rising farming costs have put increased pressure on our lives
5632588 we all know that theres likely to be another price hike in the coming months
5632589 its always like this when crude oil goes higher supply becomes tight and then the government is forced to increase prices
5632590 but i cannot remain in a business that makes me lose money
5632591 you will present the letter of confidence to the president tomorrow will you not
5632592 all right and then you will visit an tkabir will you not
5632593 then you should pack your bag and go to the airport because you are returning to tehran
5632594 it is part of the revenge for benazirs assassination she sacrificed her life to give democracy to pakistan
5632595 i think we should see about the state of the country
5632596 musharrafs analysis of the situation was correct the country is facing many problems and the leadership should try now to find a solution
5632597 some people who do not wear headscarves are more religious than ones who do
5632598 a wedding is a wedding if civil workers can do it then religious workers should be added to the list if municipal officers can perform marriages then muftis should be invited too so they can perform the religious component
5632599 i am allowed to send my kid to ballet or karate and some people want their kids to read the koran and not become satanists when you ban something people will send their children to places like the koran classes in konya
5632600 we know how to make people understand things if they insist on not understanding we send a yellow envelope start an investigation and make them feel misery
5632601 we are ruling a state not a club only people who love cats can enter the cat lovers union not the cat haters if the deans do not see that we know how to tell them there is a saying in turkish if one does not get something by word they will get it by force
5632602 there is no need for such threats obviously ayhan has the most power if we make a mistake of course they can investigate but because there is nothing he can claim his attitude is only threats
5632603 his attitude towards me is clear he asked me to resign and i refused
5632604 under the current curriculum students do not learn their own belief system well enough the practice of prayer ought to be shown in class we need to have elective classes for that or we can open a special class or masjids small mosque
5632605 abdest ablution should be taught in practice there needs to be more prayer in class especially in the ninth grade belief systems such as monotheism polytheism gnosticism or atheism are beyond or out of students interests we can introduce these systems to the students using their own interests
5632606 its dark you get the smell of an old building
5632607 it was pretty warm in there especially when we started to climb to the top
5632608 overall it looks like it was welded up last week
5632609 none of the 225 nonprofits allied with the volunteer center pays a cent for its services responding one volunteer at a time are thousands who live in benton and franklin counties they donate time and talent and plain old hard work to give comfort to care for those who are hurting to feed those who are hungry to lift up their neighbors to support the most vulnerable in our society and to build a better community
5632610 posturing to attack the base and engaged them with small arms fire
5632611 six blew themselves up six others died in the explosions and one died in gunfire from commandos their bodies have been recovered
5632612 a group of 30 mujahedeen holy fighters armed with rifles and suicide jackets attacked the american base in khost
5632613 we had a fight through the night and it is ongoing
5632614 times have been very hard for me i have been trying to get back on my feet but i just cant seem to do it
5632615 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5632616 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5632617 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5632618 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5632619 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5632620 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5632621 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5632622 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5632623 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5632624 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5632625 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane
5632626 the purpose of this site is to help show where crime is occurring at a local neighbourhood level it has been developed by the mps in conjunction with the metropolitan police authority and the mayor of london this is a live test site known technically within the industry as a beta
5632627 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5632628 they were left with some financial debt so they really have a motive to run around the world
5632629 they come right out of the 60s to a lot of people it looks almost like theyre from a different planet
5632630 the purpose of this site is to help show where crime is occurring at a local neighbourhood level it has been developed by the mps in conjunction with the metropolitan police authority and the mayor of london this is a live test site known technically within the industry as a beta
5632631 i am as old as capello but im sure we are two coaches who are pragmatic we look for success
5632632 i was not like capello as a player but i was a manager before capello and i had success which is important we have the same mentality
5632633 aston villa havent accepted a bid from anyone so unless that happens i will do nothing
5632634 if that happens then the final piece of the jigsaw is for me and the player to discuss a move to that club
5632635 i have been contacted by people on behalf of clubs but i have told them if they are interested they have to agree a fee with villa
5632636 villa silva and joaquin are three important players and if we want to do something great we have to always have them in the team because there are few players like them in the spanish league
5632637 he is calm in the dressing room he is always the same cheerful
5632638 there are only four or five teams in the league that are part time but it isnt an excuse for us not to be winning games
5632639 we have shown in some of our performances this season like against derry city and bohemians that we are more than capable of competing against the full time clubs it is just about doing it consistently
5632640 the big difference between the full time and part time clubs would be rest we have some lads that would be coming straight from work going into training and not getting the time needed to prepare probably for games
5632641 i think rest is very important to a footballer we would be doing a lot of travelling around the country and if you dont get the proper rest then it can catch up on you
5632642 free two day shipping with a free trial of amazon prime
5632643 we will make arrangements about where to hold the protest once the police notified us that one has been approved
5632644 it has all been calm so far we have not heard anything
5632645 actually someone did come here to apply to protest with a form but i dont know where he got it from
5632646 we dont have any forms here we cant give any to foreigners
5632647 we didnt even consider applying for a second because for us it is clear that the protest zones are just part of chinas cynical public relations tactic
5632648 the protest application process clearly isnt about giving people greater freedom of expression but making it easier for the police to suppress it
5632649 only yesterday the results of jades test were out and the tests indicate the possibility of cancer

5632652 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were every difficult dr forster said
5632653 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5632654 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5632655 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said

5632665 burying mere tonnes of radioactive waste in geological stable rock was low risk
5632666 our view is that there needs to be consideration in australia given to the development of a nuclear power industry dr nelson said
5632667 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5632668 we cannot envisage any circumstance under which australia will have a nuclear power industry he said then
5632669 the last election showed that australians are absolutely of one mind about not having 25 nuclear power plants dotted around their suburbs and in and around their cities mr garrett said
5632670 are they really saying that they have a plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia where are they going to put them senator wong said
5632671 australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources we have a lot of solar we have a lot of wind we have geothermal resources she said
5632672 we dont believe its appropriate for australia to go down the nuclear path

5632708 a great number of events that china is strong in were scheduled in the first half of the games so we temporarily took the lead in gold medals

5632855 they some countries in nsg are not suspecting india of proliferation they suspect that the deal may undermine nuclear non proliferation treaty npt
5632856 the image of india is changing in europe and in switzerland india is emerging as an economic power in business circles there is an increasing feeling that india is going to be a big player
5632857 as switzerland is the main trading partner of india in this grouping it will be its greatest beneficiary
5632858 bureaucratic hurdles continue to be hindrances there is also that image of india as a difficult country to do business with
5632859 its easy to set up a factory in china but its difficult to make money its difficult to set up a business in india but once it is done its easier to reap benefits
5632860 i have been living in weymouth for the last two years where the sailing will take place in 2012 so i have two years on the rest of the competition it would be great to replicate this is another four years time
5632861 going in to the race the only thing i had to do was not finish last and the swedish guy also had to win i kept him behind me the whole race so it was a little of a bit of an anti climax going out to not lose rather than to try to win it
5632862 aston villa havent accepted a bid from anyone so unless that happens i will do nothing
5632863 if that happens then the final piece of the jigsaw is for me and the player to discuss a move to that club
5632864 i have been contacted by people on behalf of clubs but i have told them if they are interested they have to agree a fee with villa
5632865 there are only four or five teams in the league that are part time but it isnt an excuse for us not to be winning games
5632866 we have shown in some of our performances this season like against derry city and bohemians that we are more than capable of competing against the full time clubs it is just about doing it consistently
5632867 the big difference between the full time and part time clubs would be rest we have some lads that would be coming straight from work going into training and not getting the time needed to prepare probably for games
5632868 i think rest is very important to a footballer we would be doing a lot of travelling around the country and if you dont get the proper rest then it can catch up on you
5632869 we have to get behind him because he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team
5632870 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides but overall i am positive he will recover
5632871 the lads were winning 2 1 but then in the last minute gael gave away a really stupid penalty
5632872 at the same time he played brilliantly all season he improved immensely and turned into a great defender as a result but he messed up that day
5632873 i dont think something similar would happen to him now because hes a lot more experienced
5632874 villa silva and joaquin are three important players and if we want to do something great we have to always have them in the team because there are few players like them in the spanish league
5632875 he is calm in the dressing room he is always the same cheerful

5632891 he was a great journalist and a great man and we will all miss him so much
5632892 bob humphrys made a huge contribution to bbc wales over many years in a wide range of programming
5632893 first as a current affairs journalist but also as someone who got to the heart of the sporting world thats so important in wales
5632894 he combined great knowledge and enthusiasm with humour and wit
5632895 bob had an unmistakable and distinctive style that brought him a huge following throughout wales
5632896 using the caa civil aviation authority uk register i have confirmed that the aircraft was not a microlight it was a two seat home built light aircraft from the laa light aircraft association fleet
5632897 they have found one wing and the tail and they are hoping to find even more as they go
5632898 what they have to do is mark out where they found everything it will be recorded and taken away for evidential purposes
5632899 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5632900 it was approximately two miles from the runway we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft which was also hoping to land at coventry
5632901 i saw a plane travelling east coming down sharply straight towards the woods immediately thought it looked like something was wrong
5632902 then at the last minute just 50ft up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees
5632903 paved the way for placing the first iranian satellite in orbit
5632904 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5632905 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program have been a subject of international atomic energy agency discussions and are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5632906 the risks of non compliance for providers of tax and employment related services to contractors has increased significantly and the introduction of debt transfer rules has heightened the risk for staffing companies transacting business with these suppliers
5632907 these checks will give staffing companies a significant measure of assurance that service providers in the contractor market are operating in accordance with the law
5632908 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5632909 to impose either safe or legal or rare is to him to have the government displace the womans freedom

5632920 wenn nur einer dagegen stimmt kann er kein mitglied werden
5632921 paling tidak kita harus mencari pemain yang pas untuk mengganti pemain yang absen untungnya persib punya banyak pemain bagus jadi kita tinggal memaksimalkan pemain yang ada
5632922 kartu yang didapat lebih disebabkan pemain kita melakukan protes terhadap keputusan wasit yang dinilai merugikan persib jadi kartu itu bukan karena mereka bermain keras
5632923 kita misalnya mengagendakan tiga kali latihan sore dan tiga kali latihan malam selama bulan puasa bagaimana pun kita tidak bisa memaksa pemain berlatih keras pada bulan puasa
5632924 namun kehadiran bobotoh jangan sampai merugikan persib jangan sampai bobotoh melakukan tindakan yang bisa membuat masyarakat akhirnya membeci bobotoh dan persib
5632925 pokoknya kita semua sepakat dan harus mengikuti semua persyaratan dan aturan yang dikeluarkan termasuk oleh penyelanggara pertandingan dan pihak keamanan
5632926 yang menonton persib itu bukan hanya orang bandung dan kelompok kelompok bobotoh seperti viking bomber dan rebolan jadi mungkin saja pemicu kerusuhan datang bukan dari kelompok bobotoh ini yang harus dicari jawabannya
5632927 acara ini juga digelar khusus untuk kang dada ketua umum persib yang terpilih kembali jadi walikota
5632928 tidak mudah menunjukkan permainan terbaik dalam waktu yang singkat pada pertandingan mendatang saya berharap bisa main lebih lama
5632929 jelas kecewa tidak bisa mencetak gol pada sebuah pertandingan namun tidak penting siapa yang mencetak gol yang penting persib memenangkan pertandingan
5632930 saya ingin mencetak gol dan membawa persib ke posisi lebih bagus di klasemen itu target saya
5632931 persib juga punya pendukung yang sangat fantastis ini sangat bagus
5632932 this program offers a great opportunity for students to learn about aviation and experience a college environment
5632933 this is our second year with the dc academy and we have some returning participants
5632934 we all learned a lot last year and put together a more involved schedule this year
5632935 weve had great experiences with the dc academy thus far and we look forward to continuing to work with these students in the future
5632936 we have observed that there are a number of owners whose aircraft is always for sale and who are always on the look out for a good buy
5632937 yet most of these owners go without appropriate insurance expecting the buyer to have coverage these owners are running the risk of being with the wrong coverage should a mishap occur so weve added aircraft trader to our product line for this special market
5632938 the completion of our fourth f 35 and the growing line of aircraft now forming behind it shows an emerging rhythm in our production line
5632939 in just a few days we will have all three lightning ii variants in final assembly when we take delivery of the first f 35c carrier variant center fuselage from the very first f 35 assembly quality has been unprecedented and each successive aircraft is measurably better than the one that preceded it
5632940 is the gap going to be 5 6 years or 3 4
5632941 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5632942 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as is the case of senator obama let me just say in case senator obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding i oppose such cuts
5632943 is the gap going to be five or six years or is it going to be three of four years

5632955 we are certainly examining legal option and will take a call on this today
5632956 today there are a few stories floating around about why advertising which seems like the natural and possibly only way for social networks to make money isnt working out so well techdirt and businessweek both cover advertising on popular social networks and reasons why users just arent jumping to click those ads
5632957 techdirt reminds us of long standing deals that make social networks into ad publishers for search engines namely microsoft facebook and google myspace
5632958 businessweek is also focusing on the failure of ads on myspace
5632959 bw points out that myspaces division saw an 87 surge in q4 2007 but taken with techdirts points this may only prove that the only people profiting from social network advertising are the networks themselves
5632960 found that social networking inventory is not monetizing as well as expected

5632983 the current fuel crisis and it is just that a fuel crisis in so far as the industry is concerned has swamped the industry to a magnitude greater than probably sars and 9 11 combined
5632984 the operating environment during the next 12 months is expected to be the most challenging the virgin blue group which now comprises virgin blue pacific blue polynesia blue and vaustralia has experienced to date
5632985 key drivers for the rest of our business namely capacity demand and the cost of fuel remain highly volatile
5632986 based on current market conditions and fuel prices a positive result for the current financial year is expected but remains a challenge

5633031 we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5633032 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5633033 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualise and make comparisons
5633034 this discovery may eventually lead to enhanced understanding schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder all conditions in which a persons ability to remember and change such rules is impaired

5633045 het gaat mij aan het hart dat u na jaren van trouw nu ontgoocheld bent
5633046 hoe kan het dat er in mei nog geen vuiltje aan de lucht is en dat in juni een kapitaalinjectie nodig is de top heeft het vertrouwen verloren ze moeten een daad stellen
5633047 ik heb veel mails en telefoontjes gehad ik voel de pijn wij hebben een groot beroep gedaan op de loyaliteit van de kleine aandeelhouders u bent nu ontgoocheld en dat trek ik mij aan
5633048 de raad van bestuur heeft mij unaniem gevraagd om te blijven als de leden een vertrek hadden gewild was ik gegaan ik beschouw mij als een dienaar van fortis

5633050 we hebben de bank wel op het hoogtepunt gekocht de weken erna stapelden de negatieve berichten over de wereldeconomie zich op maar dat is wijsheid achteraf
5633051 in die periode is de hele wereld veranderd begin mei waren we optimistisch de beurzen krabbelden op en het einde van de kredietcrisis leek in zicht eind juni waren de markten echter compleet ingestort en leek de crisis nog maanden te gaan duren onze buffers zijn groot genoeg maar we wilden met de kapitaalinjectie proactief handelen dat hebben we alleen niet goed uitgelegd
5633052 je hoeft geen bolleboos te zijn om te beseffen dat die deadline onze onderhandelingspositie slechter maakte we hebben kroes gesmeekt om een verlenging maar het antwoord bleef onverbiddelijk nee
5633053 we wilden snel op vragen inspelen een vergadering kost meer voorbereidingstijd en is niet geschikt voor een dialoog deze sessie is een premi re er zullen er meer volgen

5633063 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
5633064 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
5633065 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
5633066 patients with a reduction in gsm levels from their baseline ultrasound to the follow up ultrasound exhibited a significantly increased risk for near future adverse event compared to patients with increasing gsm levels
5633067 this technique will give us additional information to use in selecting patients that need aggressive treatment
5633068 in the last one week we did three times more sales than what we were clocking in the first half of this year
5633069 if the demand continues like this we jewellers will run out of gold stocks
5633070 i am getting a lot of inquiries from people wanting to buy gold after the fall in prices
5633071 jewellery prices have fallen now and given the way prices are fluctuating i plan to buy gold jewellery this week
5633072 but we are now seeing strong and growing demand at lower prices in the worlds largest gold buying market of india and believe international investment demand in the retail coins and bars market will also strengthen
5633073 i certainly hope the prices fall further as this is boosting demand
5633074 the price spike had hit our sales hard and a correction in prices was long overdue
5633075 the gold market situation is now crazy the fluctuation in prices are affecting our business
5633076 people are buying gold at this price but it all depends on the global market
5633077 you cant make a judgement now on future rates as one of the key determinant of prices is the us dollar
5633078 we hope the prices settle at around rs 1 020 per gram a price of rs 1 000 is a psychological mark if gold breaks that mark then you can call it a crash
5633079 previous research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5633080 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont usually do escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5633081 results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact bbb
5633082 but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defences protecting the brain from infection
5633083 clearly hiv infected monocytes benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people

5633086 there was less blood loss with this procedure than with conventional surgery and there is the potential for a faster recovery
5633087 the results were outstanding and suggest the robot assisted surgery is an attractive option for fistulas that would normally require abdominal surgery

5633104 china forciert den internationalen wettbewerb auf dem boden des sports
5633105 der chinesischen regierung geht es bei ihrer sportf rderung in erster linie um die internationale reputation
5633106 da ist zum einen die bewunderung die mit furcht vor der gr e und st rke chinas einhergeht dann gibt es die zweifelnde bewunderung wie sind die erfolge zustande gekommen ist doping im spiel und dann und das ist die wichtigste f r die chinesische regierung gibt es die bewunderung ohne negativen beigeschmack die wollen sie erreichen
5633107 wenn permanent der doping verdacht eine rolle spielt ist die internationale reputation der chinesen nicht hoch
5633108 damit erreichen sie dass die skepsis im ausland verschwindet und ihre leistungen noch mehr anerkannt werden

5633114 there were only 48 simi members on police records but when i conducted a review after joining here a month ago over 300 persons are suspected to have involved with simi
5633115 they are involved in underground activities and are working with a changed identity moreover a large number of bangladeshi nationals are also in the city they are under our scanner for role in terror activities
5633116 earlier they were scattered at kasewadi bhavani peth and kondhwa however now a lot of simi activists have shifted their base at kondhwa
5633117 we have kept a close watch on them and on their day to day activities whenever we find anything suspicious or if these people go missing we conduct a check at their residence and question them where they had gone

5633122 esta criminalidade cada vez mais violenta n o se resolve apenas com a pol cia de proximidade mas passa por as c maras terem primeiro a coragem e a ousadia de disponibilizarem verbas para contratarem equipas multidisciplinares suficientemente apetrechadas e capazes de trabalhar em bairros da cintura de lisboa

5633136 so we can get a good job one day and make lots of money
5633137 come on we all know that there are many people who never went to college and are rich beyond imagination
5633138 you dont necessarily have to go to college to do that
5633139 many people get their education through the school of hard knocks
5633140 to get a degree you cant get that unless you go to university
5633141 the main reason you go to college is to learn to socialise
5633142 the whole idea of a university is for different people to get together and interact

5633147 in an imaginary strong gravity world even insects would need thick legs to support them and no animals could get much larger
5633148 would act as a repulsive force that increases with distance a force that would prevent matter from clumping together in the early universe the process that was the first step in forming galaxies and stars and planets and people
5633149 would act as an attractive force increasing with distance a force that would almost immediately reverse the expansion of the universe and cause it to re collapse
5633150 astronomical observations show that the cosmological constant is quite small very much smaller than would have been guessed from first principles
5633151 is widely regarded as the single greatest problem facing physics and cosmology today
5633152 oh well if they had shoot you you would not be here to comment on the situation
5633153 if nature is so clever it can exploit mechanisms that amaze us with their ingenuity is that not persuasive evidence for the existence of intelligent design behind the physical universe if the worlds finest minds can unravel only with difficulty the deeper workings of nature how could it be supposed that those workings are merely a mindless accident a product of blind chance uncovering the laws of physics resembles completing a crossword puzzle in a number of ways in the case of the crossword it would never occur to us to suppose that the words just happened to fall into a consistent interlocking pattern by accident
5633154 t hrough my scientific work i have come to believe more and more strongly that the physical universe is put together with an ingenuity so astonishing that i cannot accept it merely as a brute fact i cannot believe that our existence in this universe is a mere quirk of fate an accident of history an incidental blip in the great cosmic drama
5633155 a universe aiming at the production of man implies a mind directing it
5633156 though man is not at the physical center of the universe he appears to be at the center of its purpose
5633157 astronomy leads us to a unique event a universe which was created out of nothing and delicately balanced to provide exactly the conditions required to support life in the absence of an absurdly improbable accident the observations of modern science seem to suggest an underlying one might say supernatural plan
5633158 fred hoyle and i differ on lots of questions but on this we agree a common sense and satisfying interpretation of our world suggests the designing hand of a superintelligence
5633159 today the concrete data point strongly in the direction of the god hypothesis it is the simplest and most obvious solution to the anthropic puzzle
5633160 e vidence for an intelligent designer becomes more compelling the more we understand about our carefully crafted habitat
5633161 this most beautiful system of the sun planets and comets could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being
5633162 the fine tuning of the universe provides prima facie evidence of deistic design
5633163 artificial language and their decoding systems memory banks for information storage and retrieval elegant control systems regulating the automated assembly of parts and components error fail safe and proof reading devices utilized for quality control assembly processes involving the principle of prefabrication and modular construction and a capacity not equaled in any of our own most advanced machines for it would be capable of replicating its entire structure within a matter of a few hours
5633164 if it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous successive slight modifications my theory would absolutely break down
5633165 the prebiotic soup is referred to in so many discussions of the origin of life as an already established reality it comes as something of a shock to realize that there is absolutely no positive evidence for its existence
5633166 the hydrogen content of early organic matter is relatively low and we can be reasonably certain that there never was any substantial amount of primitive soup on earth
5633167 the emergence of life from a primordial soup on the earth is merely an article of faith that scientists are finding difficult to shed there is no experimental evidence to support this at the present time indeed all attempts to create life from non life starting from pasteur have been unsuccessful
5633168 the complexity of the simplest known type of cell is so great that it is impossible to accept that such an object could have been thrown together suddenly by some kind of freakish vastly improbable event such an occurrence would be indistinguishable from a miracle
5633169 it is astonishing to think that this remarkable piece of machinery which possesses the ultimate capacity to construct every living thing that has ever existed on earth from a giant redwood to the human brain can construct all of its own components in a matter of minutes and is of the order of several thousand million million times smaller than the smallest piece of functional machinery ever constructed by man
5633170 the idea of molecular evolution is not based on science there is no publication in the scientific literature in journals or books that describes how molecular evolution of any real complex biochemical system either did occur or even might have occurred there are assertions that such evolution occurred but absolutely none are supported by pertinent experiments or calculations since there is no authority on which to base claims of knowledge it can truly be said that the assertion of molecular evolution is merely bluster

5633304 we are surrounded by water water is there everywhere and we have no one to help us no one has come to us for relief or rescue operations
5633305 we are ready to provide the villages with more relief and rescue operations the moment we get the orders to release the material we will release the relief material but as of now we have already given them four boats and have sent three more if need be we will send them more relief material
5633306 this village does not have proper roads nor does it have any clean drinking water they drink contaminated water so when the village head called us and said that if the doctors dont come all of us would die we rushed to them immediately
5633307 it is looking like normal today i wish it should be like this now after 16 17 days of shutdown things are returning to normalcy i appeal to the people to maintain this atmosphere
5633308 today after 10 15 days things are returning to normalcy shopkeepers have opened their shops and are cleaning the shops if gods will things would be normal now
5633309 its good schools were closed for long childrens studies were affected now the schools have opened we hope the situation remains normal here
5633310 the problem in applying stereotype threat to uk medical students is that the majority of ethnic minority medical students here are from south asian backgrounds and it is not fully clear whether negative stereotypes exist about that group
5633311 the aim of the study was to establish if negative stereotypes about that group do exist and thus if stereotype threat might be one reason that uk ethnic minority medical students are underperforming academically
5633312 the fact that these negative stereotypes exist raises the possibility that stereotype threat may be occurring
5633313 students also reported being unable to learn from unenthusiastic or intimidating teachers suggesting that negative stereotyping might adversely affect asian medical students learning by interfering with their educational relationships with teachers
5633314 it is the boards responsibility placed on it by the government to provide information for people mainly parents with young children
5633315 i think part of the problem is that the bbfc is an industry body rather than a public body
5633316 were really pleased to win our first game to start with a win is good after our performance in liege it was important to get the three points and regain confidence
5633317 the first half in particular was not good enough we know that
5633318 it was tough for us at the start of the game they came out of the blocks really quickly and set a really high tempo which youd expect because it was their first home game of the season
5633319 they put us under a lot of pressure and maybe we were a little bit slow to get going
5633320 it was certainly not the best game we have played but the important thing was that we got better in the second half and at the end fernando popped up with a goal and that was enough to win the game
5633321 it was a good finish from fernando i was just behind the shot and i could see exactly where it was going it was a great strike and it gave the keeper no chance
5633322 none of us were surprised that fernando scored in that way because we have seen him do it before in games and he also does it in training its great for us that we have that kind of player in our team
5633323 the most important thing is that we got the win we have had pre season and that was our first game in the league so it was good to get three points on the board and keep a clean sheet
5633324 we have to be happy with that but we have to look at what we can do better because there are many many things that we can do better
5633325 we were very poor defensively and we gave some bad goals away
5633326 i think we are close to doing something with robbie ive said all along that he has to get his fitness and sharpness and we are now seeing good signs of that
5633327 in the last three or four days in training hes been absolutely different class
5633328 http requests and responses can be pipelined on a connection pipelining allows a client to make multiple requests without waiting for each response allowing a single tcp connection to be used much more efficiently with much lower elapsed time
5633329 theres a lot of interest but at the same time its danish there are the cartoons
5633330 its not about being blasphemous though its about things that make both sides have a laugh thats more difficult than being provocative
5633331 until then understanding between danes and muslims meant come on eat some hummus and see some belly dancing
5633332 i thought stand up was a great way to talk about these things
5633333 later i started thinking about what i wanted to do or say
5633334 the last two weeks i started to get the hang of it
5633335 we didnt want to make a political manifesto we wanted to make good entertainment
5633336 the funny thing is hes able to make fun of muslims and danes priests and imams and others
5633337 we have not seen any significant russian movement out of georgia today
5633338 if it rolled in after aug 6 it needs to roll out
5633339 obviously if anyone thinks he can kill our citizens our soldiers and officers who are serving as peacekeepers and go unpunished we will never allow this
5633340 anyone who tries this will receive a devastating response for this we have all the means economic and political and military if anyone had illusions about this some time ago then they must part with those illusions now
5633341 we do not want to aggravate the situation but we want to be respected and our government to be respected and our people to be respected and our values
5633342 these things are a complete out of left field surprise
5633343 the ideal way is to figure out a way to puff them up to make them bigger without changing their mass
5633344 but its hard to come up with a model that can do that
5633345 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems
5633346 we now know we can focus on these genes and potentially change the ultimate course of many diseases that have a major impact on peoples lives

5633348 there was no conspiracy nobody walking in on something sexual nothing absurd like that
5633349 he writes that he went through the inquest in a daze and after that he took to his bed for eight days in a catatonic state blaming himself for her death hes never entirely recovered but how can you
5633350 he was walking down the street one afternoon and he saw a fight break out over the other side of the road he went over to help and ended up getting stabbed in the back and was paralysed
5633351 thats extraordinary and wonderful and when youre part of that you think ah this is maybe why i went into the movies in the beginning i thought it would be full of wonderful people
5633352 and weve got a movie full of wonderful people who did extraordinary things to help

5633377 jen was tired of paying for everything cobwebs come flying out of wallet when he opens it john liked living like a movie star when he was with her jen would never say anything but you could tell it irritated her
5633378 these results will only energise the british public ahead of our own london games in 2012 the majority of visitors to london 2012 will be domestic visitors and no doubt great sporting expectations and results will help us to deliver the 2012 tourism legacy

5633381 it was one of those nights when i wore a super tight dress that you couldnt have worn anything under since it would have showed
5633382 the paparazzi were literally lowering their cameras like speculums when i got out of the car
5633383 on the way home i said to my husband len wiseman darling i think they might have gotten it and so when we pulled in at home i made him reenact the thing with his camera a sort of crime scene run through
5633384 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5633385 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5633386 it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support

5633388 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
5633389 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die

5633411 kenny is looking very good hes just concentrating on himself and his performance in the ring he knows hes going to have to be clinical but hes a better boxer than silva
5633412 on the law of averages youd have to fancy him
5633413 but were all only human here of course we feel the pressure and anxiety building personally id be happy to be heading home now with medals around their necks but you have to earn an olympic medal and thats what were hoping we will do
5633414 wed be hoping that kennys southpaw right hook will slow him down
5633415 body shots arent really scoring here and silva has a high defence so hes going to have to be very accurate from the off but he has all the skills and talent to beat this guy
5633416 kenny is the man he is at ease with himself and he performs best when he is happy
5633417 paddy is throwing three times as much leather as this guy but hes got to make it count his accuracy has to be good i felt he was very edgy in the first round last saturday after waiting around so long to get in the ring
5633418 bear in mind that three of the other guys had two fights over them before paddy finally got in he was effectively waiting around for two weeks and i think it put him on edge
5633419 maybe i was a bit too eager to get in
5633420 but i definitely feel that i can kick on now i know my fitness is there that guy was running away from me in the end
5633421 id never do that even if i felt i was going to be knocked out id keep on fighting i dont think theres anything in this division to worry me too much

5633429 the fans have given us so much support over the past three years
5633430 it would be absolutely tremendous to be able to give back to them and bring a title back
5633431 there arent many guys in the league who can just run by anybody and score from 15 yards out on the run and he has that ability
5633432 and if you slide to him he can make the right pass hes a tough guy to match up with hes focused and ready to play and i dont think theres anybody better than him
5633433 i think its a matter of winning a championship without having guys like gary gait and mikey powell on the field with you i think he can kind of solidify his place in history by winning another championship
5633434 i didnt win anything up until my professional career so winning at the highest level meant a lot i had been playing the game for a long time and to win one of the hardest championships was definitely an amazing feeling
5633435 this is what we have been working for and the first twelve games of the season dont mean anything anymore we got beat up last time we played them so were looking to get them back and i think its going to be a great game
5633436 it may be the indian and not the pana but still your pana needs to be sharp

5633440 i believe that john mccain has the experience that we need
5633441 just look in the newspaper and watch the news watch whats going on in the world it scares me to think of somebody like illinois sen barack obama leading this country when theres so much going on i think that hes got a lot of charisma and i think its all fluff and no substance

5633447 aston villa havent accepted a bid from anyone so unless that happens i will do nothing
5633448 if that happens then the final piece of the jigsaw is for me and the player to discuss a move to that club
5633449 i have been contacted by people on behalf of clubs but i have told them if they are interested they have to agree a fee with villa
5633450 there are only four or five teams in the league that are part time but it isnt an excuse for us not to be winning games
5633451 we have shown in some of our performances this season like against derry city and bohemians that we are more than capable of competing against the full time clubs it is just about doing it consistently
5633452 the big difference between the full time and part time clubs would be rest we have some lads that would be coming straight from work going into training and not getting the time needed to prepare probably for games
5633453 i think rest is very important to a footballer we would be doing a lot of travelling around the country and if you dont get the proper rest then it can catch up on you
5633454 i am as old as capello but im sure we are two coaches who are pragmatic we look for success
5633455 i was not like capello as a player but i was a manager before capello and i had success which is important we have the same mentality
5633456 i have been living in weymouth for the last two years where the sailing will take place in 2012 so i have two years on the rest of the competition it would be great to replicate this is another four years time
5633457 going in to the race the only thing i had to do was not finish last and the swedish guy also had to win i kept him behind me the whole race so it was a little of a bit of an anti climax going out to not lose rather than to try to win it
5633458 villa silva and joaquin are three important players and if we want to do something great we have to always have them in the team because there are few players like them in the spanish league

5633500 every gun imported to this region will be branded so that when a criminal is arrested with it we can easily say that this gun is from kenya or uganda
5633501 at first we wanted to brand guns with only the country code on top but we later decided to use high tech machines that brand all internal parts of the guns with a bar code

5633504 were seeing that when these ceramic flat irons are used at the highest heat settings and on a daily basis to achieve straight hair they can really take a toll on the structure of the hair and cause very noticeable problems that can be hard to repair
5633505 if you look at the sales statistics you see that people are pursuing straighter hair with more vigour
5633506 most people on tv and in films have straight hair and its a trend the public is trying to emulate
5633507 the problem starts when they do it wrong or too frequently and they cause a real mess that takes a long time to fix

5633517 it gives you a chance to succeed if you focus on the little things and the details
5633518 they had won four games in the six years before i got there
5633519 every minute is accounted for every second one thing we never do is waste time
5633520 i rely on them heavily to teach the fundamentals to the players
5633521 if you look back there have been some issues in the area
5633522 its sad when it happens to anyone but when it happens to a child its just that much more sad
5633523 fuel raises the bar in terms of scale and exhilaration for racing games we begin with the largest racing environment to appear in gaming ever with our accelerated effects of climate change and dynamic weather system we add an extra dimension that change races on the fly and constantly presents new challenges to players
5633524 we have to increase the speed of our growth organically and to do that you need to create more quality products and you need more talented people to do that our aim is to grow our studio network even more in the future because we feel that these are really the great assets of our company
5633525 to be able to manage with all these countries and cultures isnt easy but we have done very well over the last ten years its working and its also one of our strengths to be able to motivate all these people differently but ensure they also share a focus and spirit within the ubisoft family growing the studios will be bringing us even more creativity and more great products
5633526 its true to say that we are looking at that activision blizzard and the potential ea take two merger carefully

5633528 its an absolute tragedy for all involved and our hearts certainly go out to the family members of the people in the house
5633529 ive managed to speak to some of the relatives this morning and it goes without saying that they are absolutely devastated
5633530 its a tragedy for toowoomba and the region its a real sad day when you lose anyone but particularly young people like this
5633531 we may have seen fewer house fires this winter than we have in the past few years but the fact of the matter is that it is that the majority of house fires occur during the colder months and people cannot become complacent
5633532 make sure your smoke alarms are working they can provide that vital early warning system
5633533 he left our prison early this morning and he is now already far from here
5633534 gary glitter is a persistent offender responsible for a catalogue of sexual crimes against children
5633535 so called sex tourists move around the world and target countries they know have weak or non existent child protection systems such as cambodia or vietnam
5633536 we know about glitter because of his fame but there are many other sex offenders not in the public eye who are falling off the radar
5633537 theyve got robotic technologies which they can use to monitor the seabed and they are able to use that as a mechanism for security purposes
5633538 its giving us the ability to explore scenarios in a virtual environment using real depictions of the port of sydney or the port of brisbane
5633539 its the first time that we have had these three dimensional models of our ports and then used them in a modelling environment to simulate security related issues
5633540 its an exciting challenge and a great time to begin with the west coast eagles
5633541 i believe the club is well positioned to rebound quickly from what has been a disappointing season particularly given its proud history
5633542 the club has a terrific young list and i look forward to playing my role in assisting the clubs climb back up the afl ladder
5633543 we were looking for someone with a strong coaching and administrative background and identified neale as the best person for this role
5633544 as a player and a coach he was a high achiever and has also been successful in the last 12 months as chief executive of the afl coaches association
5633545 he is a man of impeccable character someone who will add great value to our football club as we begin our resurgence as a powerful on field force in the afl
5633546 he brings to the table exactly the attributes we were looking for and believe he will assist us greatly in our vision for the team
5633547 obviously his appointment is a key strategic development in the broad picture that we have for our club and i look forward to working with him
5633548 were going to go for an american sweep 1 2 3 and see what happens
5633549 i lost so many sprints this year it teaches you to pace yourself
5633550 origin has rejected bg groups offer but has comprehensively failed to justify its position
5633551 we remain confident that our offer represents full and fair value for origins shareholders
5633552 forecast or other financial information which could assist shareholders in valuing the company and making a timely and informed decision
5633553 your directors believe bgs offer undervalues origins existing business and outstanding prospects and therefore recommend that you unanimously reject bgs offer
5633554 origin is a strongly performing australian integrated energy company with an impressive track record of growth
5633555 origin has developed the leading position in coal seam gas csg in australia and the strength of this position will be a key driver for continuing growth
5633556 of course and the pilbara electricity system is primarily a private one
5633557 integrating better the power supply in the pilbara is a sensible thing and its something industrys been talking about
5633558 the current situation in the pilbara is that there is no proper grid there is no linked up network available to new entrants wanting to buy power
5633559 up until now theres never been a network available that new customers could buy into
5633560 there are mechanisms available to government but they are long and involved
5633561 by far the best outcome would be to have a cooperative system developed where all of the major players acknowledged that there were major benefits for everybody to be involved
5633562 the current grid system has had a piecemeal approach and the government facilitating an integrated grid together with the main mining players should mean more efficient and reliable energy
5633563 examples include wave and wind power on the coast solar thermal furnaces geothermal solar thermal pond energy and even algae to biofuels photo bioreactors
5633564 whenever i meet lord digby jones my line is would you like to create 1 000 jobs in newcastle wed love to be huge but weve got a very limited number of vacancies because other ubisoft centres are more cost effective
5633565 we have to outsource quite a lot of art but we keep the core the technology the design the innovation in house
5633566 were safe as we are but wed love to have another 1 000 staff to expand like ubisoft montreal i mean i love making games at the moment we have the resources to be working on one or two titles at a time but id love to be able to work on more
5633567 its easy to pick a successful game like assassins creed and say that in hindsight it would have done fine without tax credits but would it have even been made without those tax breaks while it was hugely successful it needed to be it was a massive project with a massive budget
5633568 i dont think that the uk games industry is going to collapse without tax breaks but it certainly isnt going to be as good as it could be im really passionate about creating jobs up here in the north east

5633597 i looked around the internet for a few luxurious minutes and vastly enjoyed cranmers blog which i intend to read more regularly in future
5633598 his grace investigates with moral seriousness and intellectual rigour bringing some refreshing common sense to some of the touchiest subjects in british politics
5633599 i take advice in matters spiritual and religious from the ghost of archbishop cranmer his blog is a role model for niche blogs of all descriptions thoughtful erudite and provocative

5633602 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5633603 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5633604 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5633605 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5633606 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5633607 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution
5633608 i enjoyed my first game last week after the game everybody around me liked what i had done

5633610 unlike synagogues mosques rarely require armed guards much of the violence directed against jews actually emanates from muslims muslim extremists
5633611 a meeting like this with saudi arabia is an insult to the intelligence of every human being it is a na ve political trick
5633612 simply a pr effort for king abdullah which will give a misleading picture of the state of religious freedom in saudi arabia
5633613 despite his efforts to foster interfaith dialogue king abdullah doesnt appear to embrace religious pluralism in his own country
5633614 thank allah islam is the best religion nowadays all other faiths are just rubbish
5633615 the followers of so called other faiths will go to hell only believers like us muslims will be allowed into paradise i only tell them join islam before it is too late
5633616 for saudis women are the source of all sin in society they are merely sex objects

5633618 women are organized hierarchically and patriarchically they have no say what so ever in religious terms no wonder they have not been invited to the conference

5633622 i told the guys things in the end count more than what you do in the beginning
5633623 this will dictate a lot are you an all year player or are you a short season player theyre not going to quit theyre going to keep playing hard
5633624 we got 12 hits and left a lot of men stranded on base
5633625 the bluefield pitchers did a good job with men in scoring position and striking out cardinal hitters our guys let some good pitches go by and we swung at some bad ones
5633626 we had a lot of opportunities and we didnt take a hold of them were lucky we won 4 2 they hit that home run and if they hit another one in the bottom of the ninth with a man on and were tied but luckily we had enough to win the ball game
5633627 we battled they came in swinging we didnt swing the bat and they threw the ball well
5633628 we have to keep going come back tomorrow and get everything going again
5633629 pitching wise they battled moreland didnt have his good stuff like he usually goes but he battled well
5633630 eastham and faiola came in and got out of some jams so that was outstanding
5633631 on january 7th we didnt have a player were at 24 right now thats a good pool
5633632 but it doesnt stop there obviously now weve got a season to play we want to win every game we play theres a challenge there
5633633 the challenge is then to recruit for next year its always a challenge ive looked at it all along as a challenge for me taking this position
5633634 really with being so late we had to go through hiring a recruiting agency
5633635 they gave me a bunch of names and we were able to pick up about eight players from that
5633636 some players as far as recruiting drop in your lap
5633637 its just fallen into place i think they sense the opportunity for them to play in a new program weve got to put 11 players on the field for the first game
5633638 as a coach you always want to have a team thats going to win every game but in the context of the eight months that weve had im very satisfied with the squad that weve got
5633639 theyve done a tremendous job in the first week of preseason theyve improved come together as a team so its encouraging we havent arrived weve got some work to do
5633640 well see what weve got where were at the kids are excited theyve worked hard were going to go over there and compete im sure therell be some things to work on
5633641 weve been together now for a week and it takes time to mold a team but the progress that weve made this week has been tremendous we want to keep that going the learning and well be fine
5633642 well get punished for our mistakes and be rewarded for our good play
5633643 our ability to keep possession of the ball has been good theres a positive there compared to when we started when it wasnt real good
5633644 the speed of play is a little slow right now not where we want it to be that takes time for the players to get to know each other their tendencies and for the team to get into a system of play where theyre working together
5633645 like a chain everybodys trying to help somebody its not like anybodys being jealous or stubborn or selfish thats what soccers about nobody can play it by themselves you have to have a team
5633646 nothings expected of us which is great on one hand were expecting big things ourselves but theres no pressure on us to win were going to put that pressure on ourselves
5633647 eight months old well defy the odds perhaps and do better than i think a lot of people are expecting

5633649 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
5633650 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before
5633651 treating the human cells with an autophagy inhibitor halted the protein breakdown process but did not save the cells because v para uses other pathways by which to kill cells
5633652 however because it can kill by several routes its important to understand all of them
5633653 weve received a wake up call that this is important environmentally and we want to understand at the molecular level how this pathogen infects kills and persists
5633654 there are people getting sick from this emerging pathogen in the united states yet there is no major effort to understand its pathology
5633655 there are many ways to kill a cell and weve discovered yet another one the bacterium hijacks activities from us and deregulates them its like a bulldozer

5633658 i am happy to be back after a long wait
5633659 the club did a lot to get me here and they fought so hard to get my work permit i thank them so much i cannot wait to meet the fans and to go on the pitch with the team
5633660 in each game i am going to play there will be a lot of pressure but i am ready and here to work and if i am selected to play on saturday then i am going to be there and in the thick of things
5633661 i remember the birmingham game and what happened to eduardo the lads were winning 2 1 but then in the last minute gael gave away a really stupid penalty
5633662 at the same time he played brilliantly all season he improved immensely and turned into a great defender as a result but he messed up that day
5633663 i dont think something similar would happen to him now because hes a lot more experienced but it was definitely a match we should have won by a long way
5633664 we were leading and we even had another huge chance to score i think it was bendtner and adebayor who were bearing down on goal but adebayor shot instead of passing and missed
5633665 there were an awful lot of other similarly negative things happening everything began with eduardos injury then came gaels error and that thing with william
5633666 you could say that was probably where the ground started to crumble beneath our feet
5633667 it was not an easy situation on the other hand it was williams first season as captain and its not easy to wear the armband in a team like this
5633668 i think he will have learned there were things he could have done better but he knows that better than anyone else
5633669 hes really immersed in everything and that was something he just got immersed in too deeply
5633670 but otherwise hes a good leader in my opinion and he will continue to be captain even though there was speculation about that
5633671 when rio captained united last season he did superbly well he was a real leader
5633672 he has been at old trafford for a while now and you can see how the responsibility of being a united player has really enhanced his football
5633673 walcott is terribly unpredictable with his speed occasionally he lacks a little calmness but people always forget hes only 19
5633674 when he plays well they say hes like maradona then he has two bad games and they write hes not improving at all and that he is stagnating the truth is somewhere in between
5633675 were more experienced now precisely because of what we have gone through we took a huge step forward
5633676 at the end of last season we finished just four points behind the winners manchester united
5633677 ive already said we will be competing for the title even though people dont have much confidence in us

5633711 this mirrors the trends among developed and emerging market countries where capital flows have also surged owing to abundant global liquidity private equity and debt flows to sub saharan african countries remain small and are estimated at about 53 billion in 2007 compared with total global capital inflows of about 6 4 trillion in 2006
5633712 we need three additional years and a 10 per cent duty on goods from kenya into uganda be imposed as uganda awaits the generation of extra energy from the bujagali dam
5633713 we need more energy to produce add value and be in position to compete favourably with industrialised kenya
5633714 we make use of the safeguard clause in article 19 of the e ac treaty to apply safeguards in sub sectors where uganda has suffered injury because of the customs union
5633715 on the transfer of customs duties imposed on imports from non eac countries to the final country of consumption no express clause has been provided in the negotiations so far psfu wishes to call for the inclusion of a clause to ensure that duties collected on goods destined for the ugandan market are collected by uganda
5633716 the ability to move people and goods quickly efficiently and cheaply should be a central to the eac goal for a dynamic economy and cohesive society we must have an efficient transportation system especially since we are landlocked

5633722 i could hear the other guys breathing and i sprinted and now im the olympic winner
5633723 i knew the medal was safe but i tried to get the gold i kept thinking that this was the moment ive been dreaming of
5633724 its a shame a final should be with the best ones
5633725 i think we are playing good technically physically and mentally
5633726 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take

5633730 its an exciting challenge and a great time to begin with the west coast eagles
5633731 i believe the club is well positioned to rebound quickly from what has been a disappointing season particularly given its proud history
5633732 the club has a terrific young list and i look forward to playing my role in assisting the clubs climb back up the afl ladder
5633733 we were looking for someone with a strong coaching and administrative background and identified neale as the best person for this role
5633734 as a player and a coach he was a high achiever and has also been successful in the last 12 months as chief executive of the afl coaches association
5633735 he is a man of impeccable character someone who will add great value to our football club as we begin our resurgence as a powerful on field force in the afl
5633736 he brings to the table exactly the attributes we were looking for and believe he will assist us greatly in our vision for the team
5633737 origin has rejected bg groups offer but has comprehensively failed to justify its position
5633738 we remain confident that our offer represents full and fair value for origins shareholders
5633739 forecast or other financial information which could assist shareholders in valuing the company and making a timely and informed decision
5633740 your directors believe bgs offer undervalues origins existing business and outstanding prospects and therefore recommend that you unanimously reject bgs offer
5633741 origin is a strongly performing australian integrated energy company with an impressive track record of growth
5633742 origin has developed the leading position in coal seam gas csg in australia and the strength of this position will be a key driver for continuing growth
5633743 of course and the pilbara electricity system is primarily a private one
5633744 integrating better the power supply in the pilbara is a sensible thing and its something industrys been talking about
5633745 the current situation in the pilbara is that there is no proper grid there is no linked up network available to new entrants wanting to buy power
5633746 up until now theres never been a network available that new customers could buy into
5633747 there are mechanisms available to government but they are long and involved
5633748 by far the best outcome would be to have a cooperative system developed where all of the major players acknowledged that there were major benefits for everybody to be involved
5633749 the current grid system has had a piecemeal approach and the government facilitating an integrated grid together with the main mining players should mean more efficient and reliable energy
5633750 were seeing that when these ceramic flat irons are used at the highest heat settings and on a daily basis to achieve straight hair they can really take a toll on the structure of the hair and cause very noticeable problems that can be hard to repair
5633751 if you look at the sales statistics you see that people are pursuing straighter hair with more vigour
5633752 most people on tv and in films have straight hair and its a trend the public is trying to emulate
5633753 the problem starts when they do it wrong or too frequently and they cause a real mess that takes a long time to fix
5633754 theyve got robotic technologies which they can use to monitor the seabed and they are able to use that as a mechanism for security purposes
5633755 its giving us the ability to explore scenarios in a virtual environment using real depictions of the port of sydney or the port of brisbane
5633756 its the first time that we have had these three dimensional models of our ports and then used them in a modelling environment to simulate security related issues
5633757 were going to go for an american sweep 1 2 3 and see what happens
5633758 i lost so many sprints this year it teaches you to pace yourself
5633759 you know the definition of a long term investment its a short term investment gone bad
5633760 the benefits of long term equity investment have been dangerously oversold by harping on long term returns while failing to point out that this long term is simply too long for most investors
5633761 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5633762 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaeda and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5633763 there is no doubt that the israeli regime and people are both against islam and muslims occupying their lands so how could we speak of friendship with them
5633764 why should people who think like that be one of the presidents colleagues
5633765 i have said before that we do not have any hostility against the israeli people and i still say the same thing proudly
5633766 we are very close to deciding to send the prime minister for the closing ceremony of the olympics to be participated by many foreign dignitaries
5633767 we assure you that we will do our best to be the voice of africa along with african nations on the security council
5633768 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance
5633769 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5633770 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5633771 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5633772 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5633773 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5633774 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5633775 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5633776 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5633777 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power
5633778 democracy won today the integrity of the vote was upheld the separation of powers stands for something the city council cant be prosecutor judge and jury
5633779 was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be take are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge there are limits therefore to what can be delegated

5633782 this agreement which put syrian lebanese relations back on track is an important historical step
5633783 every syrian administration has since 1932 regarded lebanon albeit quietly
5633784 the borders of the shebaa farms cannot be demarcated under the israeli occupation
5633785 reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian border

5633787 we in the south pacific and pacific island countries in particular take democracy very seriously that is why we believe we cannot sit idly by while the principles of democracy are shredded we look forward to the discussion that will now occur minus fiji in niue on how this matter should be handled in future
5633788 i think that it is absolutely regrettable that the leader of fiji has decided not to attend the forum it would have been far better for the leader of fiji to sit down with the leaders of the pacific island countries and answer for the commitments that have been previously given by fiji to fellow island states
5633789 if someone is not prepared to come and be accountable for breaking commitments given to leaders a year ago that in itself speaks volumes so i expect that there will be a robust outcome from the forum
5633790 there is no reasonable excuse at all for fiji not attending the pacific forum i personally intervened to ensure transit visas were available for the fiji delegation to go through auckland airport to niue so they could be accountable to the forum leaders for commitments given last year
5633791 is utilized as a vehicle to forward money to the ltte liberation tigers of tamil eelam from canada
5633792 the bank records seized demonstrate that the world tamil movement has developed an elaborate machine like entity that moves throughout the greater toronto area collecting funds with extreme proficiency
5633793 congruent with the money laundering techniques often employed by organized crime groups
5633794 it is obvious from the amounts collected with this method that the pre authorized payment scheme is effective timely and spares valued resources
5633795 upon their return to canada these persons were visited by representatives of the world tamil movement to exact the collection of the monthly stipend
5633796 it will tell our dictators you are not more powerful than the people
5633797 hey those same judges and lawyers against whom musharraf foolishly picked a fight and lost are there keeping an eye on you too

5633805 the financial market experts have for good reason not been impressed by the negative gross domestic product gdp growth rate in the second quarter of 2008
5633806 overall they reckon with a weaker but all in all robust economic development and rightly do not fear a recession

5633815 it is an ho nour to be recognized for our support and contribution to the derdack success story we have been partners for 2 years and in this time we have seen a growing interest and acceptance of the mobile messaging products offered by derdack in our region
5633816 the ease with which the derdack products can be integrated into existing it systems and the speed of implementation are very important aspects of the projects we undertake in addition the innovation and vision of the derdack team helps us create new opportunities for growing our business which is good news for both ihorizons and derdack
5633817 we invest time in ensuring our partner channel can be effective the annual derdack partner conference allows us to say thank you to our part ners update them on our plans for the year ahead and enable them to see new product developments we have built a strong revenue stream with the help of our partners and we all look forward to 2009 being another year of growth
5633818 this is surely an indictment on customer data standards at any organisation that sends transactional documents all of whom want to grasp the transpromo opportunity but a section of whom seem to be undermining that opportunity
5633819 if transpromo is to be effectively exploited there needs to be an improvement in customer data standards two fifths of the population have received bills or statements addressed to the wrong person in the last six months which could seriously undermine consumer attitudes to advertising carried in those documents the opportunities presented by transpromo are probably very considerable but their effective use requires british business to make significant enhancements to the way it manages and updates customer records
5633820 we think current valuation level assumes very conservative assumptions regarding the valuation of the pipeline based on the valuation of existing assets current enterprise value assumes that the pipeline is valued at 2 6 billion euros which is too conservative in our view considering the target of 1 4 gigawatts of annual additional capacity
5633821 we are an independent country and this is in the interest of our country
5633822 the first priority is to provide political and practical support to georgia the second is to ensure that russia doesnt learn the wrong lessons from the events of the last two weeks force cannot be the basis for the demarcation of new lines around russia
5633823 im not one who believes that isolating russia is the right answer to its misdemeanours i think that the right response is hard headed engagement
5633824 i dont want to suspend the nrc but at the same time its obvious that we cant have business as usual with the disproportionate use of violence
5633825 if we have the nrc and it doesnt meet after what has happened i ask myself what point it has i hope that after this meeting we will start talking again and the great powers the us and russia will talk again
5633826 we are going to stick together as an alliance and make sure people who want to join the alliance know they have got political and practical support
5633827 i have been here for the past ten years and the olympics arent going change anything for me

5633836 young adults are still willing to change their schedules to catch their favourite shows live so that they can talk about them with their friends right away for the rest of us life is too hectic and we value being able to catch up and watch our favourite shows at a more convenient time you can do this and more with connected tv services such as bt vision which is powered by microsoft mediaroom

5633843 zusammen mit meiner frau habe ich in meiner wohnung angefangen duschvorh nge f r den heimischen markt zu n hen das war vor vier jahren eine ziemlich harte zeit als sp ter die ersten kleinen auftr ge aus europa kamen haben wir zwei arbeiter eingestellt
5633844 ich w rde meinen arbeitern ja gerne mehr zahlen aber wie einen vorhang herzustellen kostet mich rund 1 60 euro die westlichen handelsketten geben mir 1 70 euro in europa oder amerika verkaufen sie ihn dann f r 20 bis 30 euro
5633845 doch das reicht noch nicht einmal sie versuchen noch mehr herauszuschlagen berichtet bao

5633857 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5633858 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5633859 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5633860 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5633861 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5633862 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5633863 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5633864 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5633865 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5633866 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5633867 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5633868 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5633869 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5633870 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5633871 women are delaying their childbearing until they complete their educations
5633872 this is the first time weve looked at a lot of these characteristics
5633873 that to me is counter intuitive because a large share of our poor population is latino and they tend to have higher birth rates
5633874 tend to be two parent families and overwhelmingly working and because if youre undocumented youre not eligible for cash assistance programs

5633888 the survey paints a stark picture of the challenging business environment that has emerged in the uk over the past year with the economy facing its most difficult period since the early 1990s this is now compounded by high and uncertain oil and commodity prices creating inflationary pressures and fall out from the uk housing market downturn which has continued to gather pace at the same time we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year

5634032 since were now moving quickly toward 1 0 it may also help to know which direction were headed to help out weve also prepared a this will be a living document and well keep it up to date as the android landscape evolves currently it covers the next few months roughly through the end of the year and a bit into next year well update it with additional detail as we are able to but even right now it can help give you a picture of how things will play out as the first phones draw near enough of that though youre probably wondering whats actually new in the sdk well you should read the api delta report for all the details but here are a few highlights first and most obviously the new home screen is included along with a ton of ui changes for 1 0 some new applications are included an alarm clock calculator camera music player picture viewer and messaging for sms mms conversations several new development tools were added such as a graphical preview for xml layouts for users of eclipse and a tool for constructing 9 patch images since weve got a new home screen application now we thought the now obsolete version from the m5 early look sdk might be helpful to developers so its source is included as a sample a number of new apis are fleshed out and improved and others are now close to their final forms for 1 0 tons of bugs were fixed of course if you had problems with the mediaplayer try it now there are a lot of changes the ones in the list above are just my personal favorites so you should check out the links above for the full story not all the changes are additions though im sorry to say that we had to remove a few things such as the gtalkservice for security reasons and the bluetooth api theres a bit more detail in the links above and well follow up on those in particular here in this blog to give you the scoop in fact weve got a little list of topics we want to talk about here so stay tuned

5634078 from time to time lawyers and judges have tried to define what constitutes fairness like defining an elephant it is not easy to do although fairness in practice has the elephantine quality of being easy to recognise as a result of these efforts a word in common usage has acquired the trappings of legalism acting fairly has become acting in accordance with the rules of natural justice and on occasion has been dressed up with latin tags this phrase in my opinion serves no useful purpose and in recent years it has encouraged lawyers to try to put those who hold inquiries into legal straitjackets for the purposes of my judgment i intend to ask myself this simple question did the decision maker act fairly towards the plaintiff

5634218 our main aim is to put a competitive team on the field and allow the guys to develop a better understanding of the game in what is a relatively new experience for them we have been impressed with their development to date and would see this as an opportunity to continue this obviously we dont intend just to make up the numbers and would like to win a few games along the way and perhaps do a little better than wfn has predicted
5634219 we try to keep things relatively simple and play accountable football when the opposition has the ball the team tends to run the ball out of defence quite well and this is something that seems to come quite naturally to them the players have surprised us with their intent and ability to lay a tackle as well
5634220 we will try to exploit any natural advantage we have without allowing the other teams to dominate at ground level where i suspect a decent portion of the game will be played if we can get the ball into the forward line quickly our height advantage should become more of a factor
5634221 i have been impressed by all of our players and the way they have developed their skills in such a short space of time among those there are some that have developed a bit faster than others from previous articles it seems the china team like the country is a bit mysterious and we would like to keep it that way until the first game at least

5634279 yet as we know women are very industrious and dynamic in the face of serious odds

5634287 the oil price has an 85 percent negative correlation to the equity markets and therefore globally financial markets have the potential to recover as long as the pace of oil price hikes eases
5634288 even if the oil price was just to rise more slowly this would provide an opportunity for the financial markets to recover as central banks would be able to follow a more accommodative monetary policy to offset economic weakness
5634289 speculative activity should be limited as the us congress has placed speculative trades under the spotlight given the continued evidence of demand destruction this could see the oil price remain below us 120 per barrel
5634290 those levels would allow for softer monetary policy which would then feed into boosting economic growth and benefit the markets
5634291 unlike the us our reserve bank does not have a duel mandate and thus gives less attention to economic activity when making interest rate decisions

5634306 has received fees and expenses from manufacturers of contraceptives for educational presentations research projects and short term consultancies
5634307 previous research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5634308 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont usually do escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5634309 results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact bbb
5634310 but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defences protecting the brain from infection
5634311 clearly hiv infected monocytes benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people
5634312 so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5634313 were not filling that gap yet with either web or mobile which is leading to financial turmoil
5634314 but my own opinion is that well come out on the other side in five to seven years and well probably get pretty close to filling the gap
5634315 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5634316 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5634317 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5634318 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5634319 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues

5634351 non vogliamo colloqui elitari che puntano a una spartizione di potere vogliamo colloqui che portino vantaggi a tutti e noi in quanto donne chiediamo che sia riconosciuto il nostro ruolo non ancora troppo tardi
5634352 le differenze sono inconciliabili entrambi i partiti vogliono il potere ma non sono disposti a condividerlo a questo punto dobbiamo sottrarre la questione ai politici e formare un governo di unit nazionale che amministri il paese per due anni per poi andare a nuove elezioni
5634353 la sadc e lua devono imporre una scadenza certa a questi negoziati non possono trascinarli cos allinfinito se falliscono si deve instaurare un governo di transizione che non sia guidato n da mugabe n da tsvangirai
5634354 s i negoziati sono stati problematici ma dobbiamo riconoscere che almeno offrono unalternativa lunico problema che si svolgono in segreto e sono elitari in un certo senso allontanano i leader politici dallelettorato la voce del popolo non si sente
5634355 se cos non fosse lmdc dovrebbe rivolgersi ai suoi elettori e consultare il popolo sugli ulteriori passi da compiere
5634356 la cosa pi importante che i negoziati hanno dato un po di respiro ai cittadini comuni dopo loverdose di violenza e i partiti politici hanno avuto tempo per riflettere sulla situazione
5634357 e ora che la sadc tenga a freno mugabe perch la democrazia sovvertita quando chi ha preso meno voti decide come devono andare i colloqui una truffa se non si arriva a un accordo bisogna tentare unaltra strada la via da percorrere quella del governo di transizione
5634358 preferiremmo un governo di transizione per due anni al massimo non abbiamo alcuna illusione che la sadc dia una risposta alla crisi in zimbabwe laccordo su cui si sta negoziando per noi elitario

5634361 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that

5634366 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5634367 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively

5634370 the work showed for the first time that almost the entire portrush seabed the shoreface was set in motion during high energy storms whereas at portstewart only the upper part near the beach showed significant changes
5634371 a beachs ability to retain its position is usually reflected in what happens on the seabed area out to a depth of 35 metres and this is seen at portrush west strand where the beach has shown instability over the years
5634372 portstewarts beach on the other hand has been relatively stable and this corresponds with its less dynamic gently sloping seabed
5634373 dunes which can act as a sand reservoir to feed the beach when required have long since been removed through human destruction at west strand so this makes portrushs beach more vulnerable to storms in the future
5634374 to come from a nation thats so strong like australia in terms of triathlon its a fantastic feeling to finally bring home the gold medal

5634381 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
5634382 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
5634383 patients with a reduction in gsm levels from their baseline ultrasound to the follow up ultrasound exhibited a significantly increased risk for near future adverse event compared to patients with increasing gsm levels
5634384 this technique will give us additional information to use in selecting patients that need aggressive treatment

5634390 when construction is complete the charter assists in determining who should occupy the houses it also helps protect the homes and infrastructure from vandalism because the community has signed up as a party to that specific charter

5634461 michael bennett is a pro bowl running back that isnt lost on anybody

5634484 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5634485 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5634486 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5634487 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5634488 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5634489 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5634514 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5634515 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5634516 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5634517 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid

5634530 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5634531 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5634532 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal

5634538 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5634539 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts

5634547 uranium mining has taken our country away from us and destroyed it mining and the millions of dollars in royalties have not improved our quality of life
5634548 the greatest minds in the nuclear establishment have been searching for an answer to the radioactive waste problem for fifty years and theyve finally got one haul it down a dirt road and dump it on an indian reservation
5634549 for eight years in the white house every weapons proliferation problem we dealt with was connected to a civilian reactor program and if we ever got to the point where we wanted to use nuclear reactors to back out a lot of coal then wed have to put them in so many places wed run that proliferation risk right off the reasonability scale
5634550 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
5634551 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
5634552 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
5634553 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5634554 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5634555 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5634556 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5634557 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration

5634565 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5634566 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5634567 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5634568 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5634569 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5634570 the reason we arent living our dreams is inside ourselves for the most part however we pretend its people things and situations outside ourselves that are to blame but the truth is we ourselves are one of the few people in this universe that have the right and the ability to change

5634580 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5634581 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5634582 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values

5634590 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5634591 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5634592 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5634593 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5634594 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5634595 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet

5634602 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5634603 get it off the air and i really mean it
5634604 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5634605 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5634606 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5634607 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5634608 i am married to the next president of the united states
5634609 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5634610 wenn mir heute ein weihnachtsmann begegnet hau ich ihm eine rein mir ist danach
5634611 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5634612 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5634613 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5634614 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5634615 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5634616 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5634617 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5634618 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5634619 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5634620 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5634621 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
5634622 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost
5634623 if they would only let her into the debates and stand on the same stage with all the leaders people would be able to compare and see that for themselves
5634624 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
5634625 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
5634626 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
5634627 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
5634628 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
5634629 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
5634630 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
5634631 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
5634632 what do you want your look to say to people
5634633 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
5634634 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
5634635 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
5634636 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
5634637 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
5634638 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
5634639 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5634640 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5634641 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5634642 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
5634643 10 6 gw the generation capacity of the six plants x 7884 hours of generation per year assuming 90 operational 83 57 twh y 83 57 twh y x 0 65 54 mt co2 y
5634644 the incoming flight from amsterdam was coming in to land at durham tees valley airport when a laser device was shone into the cockpit
5634645 the pilot was temporarily blinded and the co pilot landed the plane
5634646 when the police helicopter was sent to investigate it too was targeted by the laser device
5634647 officers on the ground were able to arrest a 19 year old man who was outside the airport and the device recovered
5634648 we must pull together and support the candidate for president who is on our side barack obama this is at the core of what it means to be a member of our union
5634649 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
5634650 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
5634651 were going straight at our people and talking to them about the differences between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it
5634652 the show really goes back to some of the fundamental relationships from season one that everyone really cared about and got excited about
5634653 arts is integral to the sky platform and we now have the wealth and breadth of diverse arts content to warrant two dedicated arts channels
5634654 at a time when other broadcasters commitment to the arts is open to question we firmly believe in giving our customers the best choice all delivered in the highest possibly quality hd this is further evidence of our commitment to invest in the content that people love and demonstrates how pay tv can meet viewers individual needs
5634655 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5634656 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5634657 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
5634658 since i run a small computer repair business of my own i have a handful of guys working with me and i always stress to them that i want happy customers first through decent work and second by never making the customer feel stupid even if the customer made a mistake or did something stupid
5634659 although i like to think im practicing a little buddhist or socialist right livelihood here its also sound capitalism since happy customers not only come back they tell other people that your work was good and you treated them well and so they bring you more customers
5634660 we print critiques of obama all the time and dont have to go into your hyperbole

5634665 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5634666 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5634667 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5634668 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5634669 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5634670 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5634671 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5634672 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5634673 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5634674 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5634675 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5634676 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5634677 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5634678 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5634679 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5634680 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5634681 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5634682 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5634683 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5634684 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5634685 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5634686 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5634687 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5634688 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5634689 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5634690 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5634691 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5634692 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5634693 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5634694 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5634695 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5634696 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5634697 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5634698 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5634699 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5634700 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5634701 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5634702 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5634703 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5634704 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
5634705 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5634706 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5634707 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5634708 on the big issues that our nation faces some sacrifice will be required not only from you individually but from the nation as a whole there is no magic bullet to our energy problems for example no perfect energy source
5634709 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5634710 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5634711 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5634712 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5634713 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5634714 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5634715 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5634716 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5634717 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5634718 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5634719 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5634720 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5634721 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5634722 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5634723 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5634724 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5634725 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5634726 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5634727 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5634728 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5634729 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5634730 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5634731 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5634732 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5634733 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5634734 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5634735 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5634736 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5634737 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5634738 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5634739 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5634740 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5634741 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5634742 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5634743 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5634744 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5634745 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5634746 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5634747 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5634748 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5634749 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5634750 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5634751 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5634752 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
5634753 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
5634754 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
5634755 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
5634756 billofrights can you not see the irony that you use the phrase
5634757 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
5634758 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
5634759 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
5634760 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
5634761 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
5634762 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
5634763 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
5634764 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
5634765 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5634766 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5634767 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5634768 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5634769 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5634770 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5634771 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5634772 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5634773 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5634774 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5634775 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5634776 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5634777 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5634778 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5634779 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5634780 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
5634781 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5634782 no hi ha res com el cavall per tirar el susto cap avall
5634783 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5634784 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
5634785 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5634786 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
5634787 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
5634788 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5634789 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5634790 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5634791 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5634792 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5634793 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5634794 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5634795 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5634796 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5634797 what do we have to give up to reach the cost of a trillion and a half to three trillion dollars theres going to have to be some pain some sacrifice on the part of the american taxpayer isnt there
5634798 the real way to bring gasoline prices down is not by going back to try more of the same things that have not worked in the past but to say wait a minute now is the time for a really dramatic shift over to renewable energy
5634799 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5634800 the unsupported assumption catastrophic global warming follows burning fossil fuels requires immediate action
5634801 the unsupported assumption that the world is more than 6000 years old
5634802 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5634803 we are all looking forward to getting out there and doing the job we have been trained for
5634804 im a bit apprehensive about what to expect but its harder for my family
5634805 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
5634806 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5634807 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5634808 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5634809 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5634810 were going to stay in iraq to get the job done as long as the government wants us there

5634900 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane

5634906 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party

5634910 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
5634911 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense
5634912 i dont think that the muslim leadership has bothered to clear the air about what islam actually is

5634933 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability

5634951 dit jaar is in het leven geroepen omdat de sanitatiedoelstelling achterbleef bij de waterdoelstelling dit jaar moet een extra impuls geven aan de aandacht voor sanitatie ik denk dat we nu op de juiste snelheid liggen met de juiste input om ook werkelijk een verschil te kunnen maken en een groot gedeelte van de millenniumdoelen te kunnen bereiken

5635000 is one of the most profoundly political events this region collectively undertakes
5635001 we have to look at venezuela not only in the context of the traditional border line but from the perspective of its increasing petro diplomacy and the potential impact of the alba and petrocaribe
5635002 protection and preservation of a peoples freedom from external military attack and coercion from internal subversion and from the erosion of the cherished political economic and social values these values include democratic choice and political stability in the political area sustainable development and free enterprise in the economic domain and social equality and respect for human rights in the social area
5635003 there is also the view that where there are unjust economic and political structures which limit the access to basic national needs as well as unjust social arrangements such societies are not secure

5635012 that is going to pay off because they are already utilizing the skills they have learnt in preparation for carifesta we intend to keep them going and they will continue to continue to apply those skills they have learnt i see that in the near future a lot of theatre happening in guyana with a lot of good young breeds will emerge
5635013 we are very happy where we are at this point in time the entire cast has worked hard over the last few weeks and we are just basically waiting to perform for the carifesta audience

5635028 youre in the white house and you think youre safe huh you recognize me my names dr multimillionaire and i kicked your ass
5635029 karl rove has no recollection of ever saying that rep steve kagen was the number 1 candidate to beat in 2008

5635241 ministers have agreed that as in the way of the june 2007 floods funds will be made available to local councils to help those most affected by the recent serious floods
5635242 detailed guidance on the operation of the scheme has now issued to all 26 local councils
5635243 those who feel they may be entitled to the payment should contact their local council as soon as possible so that an urgent inspection may be arranged
5635244 if the council decides that your claim is eligible you will receive your payment within a matter of days
5635245 in addition councils can also offer a range of practical help and guidance including collection retention and disposal of damaged household content assistance in making arrangements to clean up home and gardens and by providing de humidifiers to dry out homes
5635246 my department will reimburse councils for the 1 000 payments to individual householders and for the direct and indirect costs of providing practical assistance and advice
5635247 i and my colleagues in the executive want to help those most severely affected to get back on their feet again and to assist them in ensuring their homes are habitable
5635248 working with and through councils my aim is to ensure that practical and financial help is delivered to those most severely affected as quickly as possible
5635249 our plan is to target 100 000 subscribers in the next 12 months

5635289 i was surprised and a little disappointed i thought that big businesses in the united states were by and large recognizing domestic partnerships like this for health care benefits
5635290 since their blue cross blue shield of alabama policy offers art benefits it is extremely troubling that honda has chosen to solely and specifically exclude same sex partners from art benefits
5635291 benefits for fertility treatment and art are limited to a lifetime maximum payment of 30 000 00
5635292 effective january 1 2008 honda manufacturing of alabama requests that blue cross and blue shield exclude domestic partners same sex partners from art benefits including diagnostic services related to fertility infertility that have a fertility or infertility diagnosis
5635293 i do have some personal experience providing infertility services for such patients i have found them to be very good patients and excellent parents i have watched these children grow up over the years and they are healthy and happy in every way they are no different than any other children
5635294 it is disappointing to see a company of this caliber and size discriminating against a certain population of patients
5635295 for one of the worlds leading automakers to discriminate and deny medical coverage for a disease based on someones personal orientation is downright appalling

5635316 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5635317 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5635318 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said
5635319 we feel deep gratitude to the local villagers and authorities that assisted us

5635333 clean coal renewables and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future baseload clean energy mix
5635334 inconvenient truth that only nuclear power could provide baseload electricity while cutting emissions
5635335 burying mere tonnes of radioactive waste in geological stable rock was low risk
5635336 our view is that there needs to be consideration in australia given to the development of a nuclear power industry dr nelson said
5635337 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5635338 we cannot envisage any circumstance under which australia will have a nuclear power industry he said then
5635339 the last election showed that australians are absolutely of one mind about not having 25 nuclear power plants dotted around their suburbs and in and around their cities mr garrett said
5635340 are they really saying that they have a plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia where are they going to put them senator wong said
5635341 australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources we have a lot of solar we have a lot of wind we have geothermal resources she said
5635342 we dont believe its appropriate for australia to go down the nuclear path
5635343 we are appreciative of the due diligence from both frost amp sullivan and ibo and are honored by their respective recognition in evaluating waters synapt hdms and xevo tq ms
5635344 waters mass spectrometry is experiencing significant momentum in the marketplace our scientists have developed novel innovations and the beneficiaries have been our customers who are realizing new levels of success in reaching their own goals and achievements
5635345 this unique combination of technologies allow scientists to differentiate samples by their size shape and charge as well as mass which has enabled the separation detection and characterization of components not possible with conventional mass spectrometry
5635346 the xevos novel collision cell design enables it to operate in t wave tm mode or in waters more recently developed scanwave mode t wave has the effect of significantly improving the fast scanning abilities of tandem ms
5635347 perhaps the more interesting capability is the scanwave mode of the collision cell which helps xevo to significantly increase the signal intensity of both parent and product ion spectra
5635348 large search marketing programs have become increasingly complex with typical programs encompassing hundreds of thousands of keywords across hundreds of concurrent campaigns but many companies and agencies are still struggling to manage these programs with linked spreadsheets low functionality ad center applications or a patchwork of point solutions we refer to these as black box solutions because they provide marketers and agencies with very little visibility or control over their programs
5635349 marins no black box campaign aims to expose the limitations of yesterdays search marketing technology and introduce a new approach to managing search programs that addresses the needs of professional search marketers
5635350 as weve engaged with agencies and professional search marketers and discussed the challenges theyre facing it has become very clear that the biggest search spenders are reaching the limit of what their technology can support
5635351 marin software represents a quantum leap beyond what has been possible in the past at a time when the industry urgently needs professional solutions marin helps advertisers better manage their existing campaigns and provides the enterprise class infrastructure necessary to support profitable search program growth

5635369 todays bulk powder processors know that hose clamps can be difficult to fit this improper fitting can cause powder to leak into the atmosphere creating potentially hazardous air quality conditions additionally sloppy fit can contribute to product build up and cross contamination
5635370 we are proud to offer the bfm fitting to bulk powder processors in an effort to reduce these problems
5635371 flat out the bfm fitting results in safer and cleaner bulk powder processing
5635372 the bfm fitting is very quickly revolutionizing bulk powder processing
5635373 every single person weve talked to has told us that theyve come across articles or news content that they thought were biased or factually inaccurate this is exactly the problem were trying to solve
5635374 access to credible and accurate news is a cornerstone of democracy and its absolutely essential that news readers can trust the news they read at newscred were providing the transparency and accountability to ensure this trust is maintained giving news readers a platform to voice their opinions and building an online track record for journalists is the first step towards restoring some of the news medias lost credibility
5635375 how trustworthy are the news sources you rely on and how credible are the journalists who are producing that news this is ultimately the question we will help answer its a question of accountability and ensuring that the journalistic principles of objectivity and accuracy are never compromised by outside interests
5635376 we havent seen this level of transparency anywhere else in the media industry and were convinced it will benefit both news readers and journalists alike
5635377 what i found typical of historical fiction novels was that authors put characters into events that everybody had already heard about

5635384 hay otras empresas que quieren radicarse en vilelas los representantes de una aceitera me plantearon el inter s de ubicarse en algunas de estas hect reas y hay otros inversores que est n haciendo las consultas pertinentes porque saben que es una zona estrat gica adem s nuestro objetivo es recuperar la zona industrial siempre respetando no solamente los derechos de los vecinos sino el impacto que producir n en el ambiente las industrias si cumplen con todos los requisitos no habr inconvenientes
5635385 tenemos ordenanzas promocionales en materia impositiva que les da tiempo a la empresa para que pueda consolidarse pero como contrapartida exigimos que el 80 por ciento de la mano de obra sea local lo que permitir bajar los ndices de desocupaci n que desde el cierre de gran cantidad de industrias llev a que hoy la mitad de nuestra poblaci n est desocupada

5635387 en reiterados casos estableci que las cuestiones de derecho p blico provincial no son revisables por la corte suprema de justicia salvo cuando hay sentencias condenatorias arbitrarias
5635388 porque habitualmente son los particulares los que accionan contra el estado y en este caso ser el estado el que accionar contra un particular esto no tiene precedentes
5635389 evidentemente lo que se busca con una acci n de este tipo es ganar tiempo y dilatar todo lo posible la ejecuci n de la sentencia favorable a la contadora p rtile que tendr que esperar a que la corte se pronuncie ese plazo de espera es indefinido porque la corte no tiene un tiempo l mite para emitir una resoluci n
5635390 determina que deben restituirla porque lo que demand la contadora p rtile fue la anulaci n de su destituci n y una vez establecido eso el retorno al estado anterior al juicio pol tico implica su regreso al cargo que ocupaba en el tribunal de cuentas

5635489 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
5635490 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before
5635491 treating the human cells with an autophagy inhibitor halted the protein breakdown process but did not save the cells because v para uses other pathways by which to kill cells
5635492 however because it can kill by several routes its important to understand all of them
5635493 weve received a wake up call that this is important environmentally and we want to understand at the molecular level how this pathogen infects kills and persists
5635494 there are people getting sick from this emerging pathogen in the united states yet there is no major effort to understand its pathology
5635495 there are many ways to kill a cell and weve discovered yet another one the bacterium hijacks activities from us and deregulates them its like a bulldozer
5635496 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5635497 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5635498 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5635499 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5635500 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5635501 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution

5635581 what if you want to install something not in the package manager windows beats linus hands down
5635582 pacman kde4 and it was soon downloaded and installed and worked honestly how much simpler can you get
5635583 first of all lets face it you are the weakest link in any os
5635584 finally just the fact that linux is open source means that more eyeballs can see bugs and vulnerabilities making it easier to patch any coder in his her moms basement could issue a fix for the community
5635585 it would be a totally different ball game if these pcs had no os on them windows wouldnt come out all that superior i would even wager that linux would probably do a better job
5635586 i am sure when it comes to community other proprietary operating systems do envy us
5635587 long story short after around 2 hours of trying to get an hp printer to work on xp i gave up and plugged into an ubuntu linux eee pc it got recognized in 30 seconds
5635588 it would be a totally different ball game if these pcs had no os on them windows wouldnt come out all that superior i would even wager that linux would probably do a better job

5635592 a delightful array of lyric driven songs on two thousand miles
5635593 owen temple writes polished country music infused with folk traditions what distinguishes his songs are lyrics that extend the plainspoken stories associated with the genre into a more nuanced psychological terrain

5635598 this conflict is very much about proving who is the bad guy
5635599 were afraid because of the situation because of the russians
5635600 but the russian soldiers were afraid also of meeting with the georgians eventually they were asking the people to give them food drinks and water
5635601 youve got to go where your audience is and for people in the age group theyre targeting life exists online schools that dont have an online presence in social media are going to be sidelined
5635602 i dont really check my mail that often except when i know bills are coming and i throw brochures away but i check facebook two three times a day
5635603 that type of recruiting has taken a great leap forward on the web
5635604 it gives colleges an edge and keeps them relevant if colleges dont engage in this medium they simply risk missing a lot of students
5635605 we were just amazed at how well this worked beyond our wildest dreams
5635606 its been the single best performing ad campaign in the history of alliant

5635608 ive seen cases where institutions devoted scarce resources to a blog while their main web site was subpar
5635609 in that kind of situation they would have been better off not diverting their resources to the new whiz bang technology
5635610 im not just sending somebody a flier and saying you figure it out
5635611 we feel we need to jump on board because a lot of our competitors are doing the same
5635612 it gives me an entr e into a much fuller way of knowing who they are
5635613 i can see what their background is where theyre located what they studied in college what their interests are i can see if theyre avid sports fans who might be a good fit for my program
5635614 the u s mint buys direct from the refiners and this suspension of gold eagle sales may be an indication that the supply line is already backing up or that the mint expects that it will back up for the rest of the year i wonder who would give up physical metal at these prices and under these circumstances except distressed sellers the central banks are in a hunker down mode as far as i can determine and its the mines that supply the refiners so if the mint which buys from the refiners is having a difficult time locating metal what does that tell you i keep saying that we may get a surprising rubber band effect later in the year when the pre holiday festival season kicks off in september october it may happen sooner one of our indicators of approaching a bottom in gold is how many calls centennial precious metals gets from our u s based indian clientele heres a quote from my offices report to me at the end of the day today today was a good day there must have been an indian convention where someone was handing out usagold business cards that may give you a clue as to thinking in india proper and probably the rest of the asian rim
5635615 would you want to know if the most horrific attack on your country was perpatrated by its own government would you really want to know
5635616 made by the wachowski brothers and joel silver of matrix fame
5635617 we can be sure that the wachowski brothers were referencing the order out of chaos system since at one point in the film the opressive english parliment gets frustrated that their society is embracing the terrorist acts against them and decides to begin committing terrorist acts under the guise of v in order to turn the people against him and again embrace their oppressive form of government police state they even unleash a biological virus on their people in the film killing almost 100 000 people and if the history of terrorism in literature and cinema is any indicator you should probably mind your hygeine habits in the coming years because as exhibited below several times in recent years terrorist acts have been depicted almost exactly as they go down in entertainment sold to us beforehand
5635618 as for anyone who scoffs at the notion that government connected interests could be planting depictions of terrorism in hollywood that isnt the allegation the more realistic notion is that such interests have been made privy to certain plotlines and then decide to preempt them in real life to affect how you see their portrayal upon release of the entertainment material
5635619 but perhaps that is the desired goal by the powers that be to push americans until they fight back and really give you a pretext to lay on the police state thick since the outcome of another staged attack like 9 11 really cannot be gauged considering the growth in the population who are not so sure 9 11 is what they thought it was anymore if an attack were to occur tomorrow i dont believe theyre certain they can sell us on their version of it and i believe that scares them
5635620 really source of proof please science observation proves you wrong and a habitual chronic pathological liar as well
5635621 on june 12 1980 a third explosive eruption produced 25 feet of stratification that amazed geologists successive layers are traditionally thought to require long periods of time to form yet upwards of 100 layers accumulated mostly between the nighttime hours of 9 and 12 while a plume swiftly ascended nine miles above the mountain wave after wave of pyroclastic flows began hurtling out of the crater and down the north slope each dusting the valley below with another lamination measuring from a fraction of an inch to over a yard in thickness each took from a few seconds to a few minutes to form
5635622 geologist steven austin described these pyroclastic flows as ground hugging fluidized turbulent slurries of fine volcanic debris they moved down the mountainside at hurricane speeds and left deposits of 1000 degrees f one would expect each deposit to be homogenized amp thoroughly mixed remarkably these high velocity slurries of red hot ash and pumice separated into coarse and fine particles of perfectly defined layers such features follow laws governing flows demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks
5635623 similar thin layering appears in the tapeats sandstones of the grand canyon
5635624 yup you could explain to me that you have observed first hand the layering in your septic tank too im sure there is an analogy here but it escapes me at the moment do tell what is the connection
5635625 i suppose you did read darwins radio your choice of reading materials reveals a lot dawkins specialties are fiction and fantasy not observable science his much acclaimed among fools weasel analogy was a complete fraud youre clutching at fables in a last ditch effort to avoid the conclusion that there is a god to whom you will answer one day youre not ready for that
5635626 hey bj antibiotics kill bacteria not viruses you cant kill viruses with antibiotics and viruses dont mutate in response to antibiotics theyre unaffected sheesh i would have thought you would get it the first time you were corrected your knowledge of science is pathetic and youre a very dense slow learner
5635627 so we have layer upon layer fair enough of varying thicknesses of pyroclastic flows why is that such a big deal and yet again i gave to remind you that such layers are not sedimentary
5635628 yah and bears make big potty in the woods so what are you still beating that one trick pony i regret to inform you but your hobbyhorse is dead
5635629 are you a complete freaking idjit the point is that the aggregates were not only layered but segregated according to aggregate size what you have at msh is 25 feet of finely layered segregated aggregates laid down in 3 hours not a long series of separate volcanic eruptions one ringy dingy two ringy dingy if you cant comprehend the material go back to the nursery and retrieve your binky

5635631 the mainstream baptists have repeatedly warned that southern baptists were being led into bible idolatry the 2000 bfm confirms the veracity of this charge the sbc is officially requiring that members bow to the bible before bowing to jesus sbc demotes jesus by dr bruce prescott
5635632 the sole authority for faith and practice among baptists is jesus christ
5635633 doctrines we hold precious and as essential to the baptist tradition of faith and practice
5635634 is the record of gods revelation of himself to man
5635635 the criterion by which the bible is to be interpreted is jesus christ

5635663 do not be afraid to take mary as your wife for the child within her was conceived by the holy spirit and she will have a son and you are to name him jesus for he will save his people from their sins

5635665 truly truly i say to you before abraham was i am
5635666 we have found the very person moses and the prophets wrote about his name is jesus the son of joseph from nazareth
5635667 when i was with you before i told you that everything written about me in the law of moses and the prophets and in the psalms must be fulfilled
5635668 yes it was written long ago that the messiah would suffer and die and rise from the dead on the third day
5635669 so be truly glad there is wonderful joy ahead even though it is necessary for you to endure many trials for a while these trials are only to test your faith to show that it is strong and pure it is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold and your faith is far more precious to god than mere gold so if your faith remains strong after being tried by fiery trials it will bring you much praise and glory and honor on the day when jesus christ is revealed to the whole world
5635670 we can rejoice too when we run into problems and trials for we know that they are good for us they help us learn to endure and endurance develops strength of character in us and character strengthens our confident expectation of salvation and this expectation will not disappoint us for we know how dearly god loves us because he has given us the holy spirit to fill our hearts with his love
5635671 i am joseph your brother whom you sold into egypt but dont be angry with yourselves that you did this to me for god did it he sent me here ahead of you to preserve your lives
5635672 but daniel made up his mind not to defile himself by eating the food and wine given to them by the king
5635673 and not only that but we also boast in our sufferings knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance produces character and character produces hope and hope does not disappoint us because gods love has been poured into our hearts through the holy spirit that has been given to us
5635674 everything in the scriptures is gods word all of it is useful for teaching and helping people and for correcting them and showing them how to live

5635688 when you are playing mendis you have to save wickets and get runs as well it gets a bit tough even murali muttiah muralitharan was difficult some time back but mendis is a bit more unusual than him
5635689 its difficult to pick him mendis he is a very different bowler even if you pick him by the time you realise what ball it is it gets really late to play a big shot
5635690 in one day cricket it is not only about playing him but also rotating the strike because you dont want a bowler to end up with 10 overs for 20 runs we need to find a way to rotate the strike
5635691 i have not seen any bowler like him he is an unusual bowler the only option right now is to play more and more of him and thats the only way of getting better
5635692 we misread the wicket a bit there was a fair bit in the pitch for bowlers early in the match the sri lankans bowled really well as they got early wickets credit goes to them
5635693 later on mendis put the pressure the only thing we were doing was to catch up and it gets really tough in one day games if you lose too many wickets up front

5635871 i am sure you will find something in the package that may not apply to your situation my hope is that you wont use that as a reason to have second thoughts about meeting with me next week

5636029 mengapa kamu tidak membuat pesantren dakwahmu tidak menghasilkan orang alim atau penuntut ilmu sejak lama

5636039 dan apa yang kamu perselisihkan dalam satu urusan maka hukumnya dikembalikan kepada allah
5636040 jika kamu berselisih dalam satu urusan maka kembalikanlah kepada allah dan rasul nya jika kamu beriman kepada allah dan hari akhir
5636041 apakah hukum jahiliyah yang mereka kehendaki dan siapakan yang lebih baik daripada allah bagi orang orang yang yakin
5636042 barangsiapa yang tidak memutuskan menurut apa yang diturunkan allah maka mereka itu adalah orang orang yang kafir
5636043 dan janganlah sekali kali kebencianmu terhadap suatu kaum mendorong kamu untuk berlaku tidak adil berlaku adillah karena adil itu lebih dekat kepada takwa dan bertakwalah kepada allah sesungguhnya allah maha mengetahui apa yang kamu kerjakan

5636065 hai manusia telah dibuat perumpamaan maka dengarkanlah oleh kalian perumpamaan itu sesungguhnya segala yang kalian seru selain allah sekali kali tidak dapat menciptakan seekor lalatpun walaupun mereka bersatu untuk menciptakannya dan jika lalat itu merampas sesuatu dari mereka tiadalah mereka dapat merebutnya kembali dari lalat itu amat lemahlah yang menyembah dan amat lemah pulalah yang disembah

5636070 sunil hitech engineers is more to do with the infrastructure related space and it is into fabrication engineering erection and commissioning of power plants it has an excellent track record of past three four years where it has shown its execution capabilities which is the major criteria to judge this kind of a company and this has been showing this 30 40 growth every year on year for past three four years
5636071 this company has a very strong order book position of around rs 800 crore which is around 3 times of its fy08 sales these orders have to be executed within 18 24 months and the good thing is that these orders are again diversified in nature some of them are from distribution some of them are from generation companies and some of them are from even steel companies the company recently has got an order of rs 100 crore out of which rs 90 crore is from ntpc and rs 10 crore is from jsw steel so that gives a visibility of companys revenues as well as its capability of executing different things
5636072 the company is focusing on getting value added it is focusing on bop projects thats balance of plant work so that is again a major portion out of total power project cost 40 45 will come from bop which this company is targeting at and it has shown the capability of taking over those challenges
5636073 in fy08 the company has shown net sales growth of 112 and pat growth of phenomenal of 178 so we are extremely bullish on the companys performance and as per our meetings with the management we have seen that they have the bandwidth to execute these projects so we have a target of fy09 sales of rs 386 crore again which is very conservative target and considering all sorts of input pressures all sorts of compression and ebitda margins we still feel that the company has a potential to earn around rs 24 crore in this fy09 which gives us a dcf based target rise of rs 280

5636084 beijings strategic and energy objectives are based on stability in xinjiang and its central asian policies grow out of its preoccupation with stability there
5636085 since the beginning of this year we have seen the deployment of some new tactics by insurgents
5636086 they are no longer targeting civilians by planting bombs on buses as they did in the 1990s but attacking government personnel army and the police this is aimed at winning the general population on their side

5636092 there is a need to update the skills of local trainers as the broader constraint is the complete isolation of the agricultural university and professional community in iraq for more than 15 years
5636093 it is important to understand that india was once where iraq is today in terms of its poultry industry
5636094 india still has a long way to go in processing its poultry but the production systems have been developed with small farmers and that is what iraqi industry workers can learn

5636096 the legal cases between oklahoma and arkansas evolved from a conflict over point source pollution involving municipal wastewater discharge to a conflict over nonpoint source pollution in the form of nutrient runoff from poultry litter
5636097 in light of three decades or more of significant structural changes in the animal agricultural production system this shift from point source to nonpoint source mirrors the evolution of how water quality has been addressed since the enactment of clean water act
5636098 perhaps theres a better way to address these problems without litigation or overly burdensome government regulation
5636099 discernible confined and discrete conveyances including any pipe ditch channel tunnel conduit well from which pollutants may be discharged
5636100 a consequence of these structural changes is that extraordinary amounts of animal waste are produced in geographically limited areas
5636101 this waste must be disposed of or utilized somehow and a traditional and common method is for producers to apply it to the land as fertilizer
5636102 policymakers may begin to consider new policy approaches to addressing nonpoint source pollution particularly if they conclude that addressing the issue through region based litigation may not be the most effective tool to address a national issue the thought might be that perhaps theres a better way to address these problems without litigation or overly burdensome government regulation

5636129 a total of 71 people were on the coach including the driver
5636130 unfortunately one man suffered fatal injuries and was confirmed dead at the scene
5636131 the accident occurred in a very difficult area to access with the coach ending up on its side down a steep embankment which hampered rescue attempts
5636132 due to the scale and seriousness of the incident its fortunate there were not more serious or indeed fatal casualties

5636140 if they keep on saying that line and they continue to fail controlling them milf sub commanders then the government will certainly control them
5636141 i think the philippine sports program in general has been very very shortsighted in participating in international competitions
5636142 you already have athletes who are not really spring chickens but by the time they start competing the potential for them to improve on their times or better their records is not really there anymore
5636143 were looking at a six to eight year timetable to develop our young athletes michael phelps didnt hit the pool six or seven years ago he was already winning golds in athens
5636144 for example the amateur boxing association of the philippines you have boxers in cebu in the visayas in cotabato but theyre not recruited into the national team
5636145 look at the superpowers in the world the united states sports organizations are entirely private china is entirely government we are in between and that doesnt work
5636146 if they dont liquidate they dont get their funding but more than that the psc really has to deepen its involvement in nsa output without necessarily interfering internally
5636147 so the summit has to set checkpoints and milestones for our sports programs within the next two years our athletes have to start contending at the asian level by 2011 we should be swamping the sea games and medalling at asian level competitions
5636148 every step of the way government should be monitoring progress and pull the plug whenever they nsas and athletes veer off track
5636149 no more of i know we were wrong we will try to improve we cannot wait for that anymore we have to find solutions especially now that our people are becoming less optimistic about our athletes performance
5636150 we need something to inspire us and make us feel better about the country and ourselves as a nation

5636217 the common admission form means everybody applies everywhere regardless of the marks they score this in turn can inflate the cut off marks for colleges setting in panic among students
5636218 colleges usually look at the number of students and the number of seats they offer before arriving at cut off marks for a course
5636219 so the first cut off this year will not be very different than last year students should apply after keeping a margin of plus minus three per cent
5636220 however in practice everybody applies in the maximum number of colleges because the common form makes the process really easy the toppers apply in colleges they may not join finally but this actually cranks up the cut off marks a lot of colleges also decide their cut off based on past experience
5636221 colleges definitely compete with each other they think that higher the cut off the better their college is but the truth is that last year many prestigious colleges had to go in for a second list
5636222 we feel that he has been rejected mainly because he belongs to a scheduled caste

5636224 we are looking at several options for the third floor once the clerks office and the bureau of elections move out one thought is to move our geographic information systems department up to the third floor so that they will be on the same floor as the assessor and the mapping department

5636295 the current fuel crisis and it is just that a fuel crisis in so far as the industry is concerned has swamped the industry to a magnitude greater than probably sars and 9 11 combined
5636296 the operating environment during the next 12 months is expected to be the most challenging the virgin blue group which now comprises virgin blue pacific blue polynesia blue and vaustralia has experienced to date
5636297 key drivers for the rest of our business namely capacity demand and the cost of fuel remain highly volatile
5636298 based on current market conditions and fuel prices a positive result for the current financial year is expected but remains a challenge
5636299 we successfully lured the calf about a kilometre out to sea probably the first time thats been done using a yacht as a surrogate mother
5636300 later we saw whales a bit further offshore and there was a slender chance it may have linked up with them but this morning we have got reports that it has returned to the western shores of pittwater
5636301 while its moving quite freely at the moment its condition would be expected to deteriorate over the next three days
5636302 weve consistently said it was a slim chance that it might link up with its mother or other whales but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5636303 looking at its behaviour the way it was nuzzling up to yachts would indicate it was primarily still suckling
5636304 it really was trying to suckle just below the waterline and against the keel with its head engaged against the boat
5636305 it would be easy to give in cut interest rates and let inflation get out of control thats what happened in the 1970s
5636306 but it would be damaging and dangerous for the economy
5636307 a return to low inflation will only happen if people dont chase inflationary wage increases
5636308 everyone wants to protect their living standard but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs
5636309 then well all be back to square one but with inflation still high

5636312 were really looking forward to going deep and revisiting not only the songs but also the story
5636313 interestingly enough us going over all the old material seems to be influencing our writing of the next record which were sort of doing simultaneously and to me that seems appropro since the next story is the prequel to the amory wars

5636319 in the end it all leads to great songs and there you have the benjy davis project
5636320 this is a dream deal with an artist driven approach to the music business at real records we have used a similar concept in developing artists with an emphasis on live performances tom derr of rock ridge has a proven track record developing artists for the major labels he has been instrumental in the success of the dave matthews band and three doors down we have always felt that similar success lies ahead for the benjy davis project we look forward to working with tom derr and rock ridge music
5636321 the project has gone about the business of becoming a credible college rock band the hard way grinding it out on the road and writing the sort of autobiographical anthems that southern teens want to sing along to
5636322 gabes voice is flawless and it delivers some of the most well crafted heart felt kick ass songs ive heard in a long time he and the band are truly gifted and were lucky they decided to share those gifts with the world

5636324 i cant decide whether gabe dixons secret weapon is his brilliance on the piano or his heart melting voice i guess ill call it a tie we fans have already witnessed this trios blazing live performances their self titled album is the recorded proof im guessing that gabe wont be a secret for long after people hear these songs

5636389 we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year
5636390 we expect the slowdown to be at its worst towards the end of 2008 and into early 2009
5636391 we also expect inflation to start falling back from early 2009 allowing the bank of england room to cut interest rates throughout 2009
5636392 nevertheless overall the performance of uk plc through 2009 is likely to be the weakest growth since 1992 when the economy grew by just 0 3 per cent however towards the end of 2009 providing wage inflation stays low economic activity looks likely to pick up
5636393 whilst a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession
5636394 the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate

5636408 now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the river and in egypt and serve the lord
5636409 no one can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and money shall not be so among you but whoever would be great among you must be your servant 27 and whoever would be first among you must be your slave 28 even as the son of man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many
5636410 and now israel what does the lord your god require of you but to fear the lord your god to walk in all his ways to love him to serve the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul 13 and to keep the commandments and statutes of the lord which i am commanding you today for your good
5636411 we should serve god not just because it is a duty because serving him is much more than that we should serve god because it glorifies god he is worthy of everything we can do for him and his church wouldnt you agree
5636412 whatever you do work heartily as for the lord and not for men knowing that from the lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward you are serving the lord christ

5636415 as each has received a gift use it to serve one another
5636416 if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above set your affection on things above
5636417 seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness
5636418 let no man seek his own but every man anothers wealth
5636419 what seek good things for someone else instead of for myself
5636420 and seek not ye what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind in other words dont be worried about stuff for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these things shall be added unto you

5636428 so the evolution of cells and the evolution of translation are really linked to one another
5636429 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
5636430 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5636431 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
5636432 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5636433 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles
5636434 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5636435 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5636436 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5636437 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5636438 in essence the technology can be used to overcome one of the most challenging types of problems of drug resistance
5636439 if youre not recognized as being part of the club then youre kicked out
5636440 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5636441 this could potentially be used with any drug which is effective but has a delivery problem
5636442 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
5636443 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components
5636444 ovarian cancer has a drug taxol that works pretty well in the beginning seventy or eighty percent of the patients have a response
5636445 but it fails at the end because drug resistance develops
5636446 there is certainly a need to improve access to mainstream sexual health services for aboriginal people
5636447 continuing access to effective sexual health service delivery is an essential part of reducing sexually transmissible infections among aboriginal people
5636448 this workshop is an opportunity for workers from mainstream organisations to carefully reflect on how their services are organised and delivered and how they can work better with aboriginal people
5636449 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5636450 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5636451 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5636452 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5636453 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5636454 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5636455 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5636456 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5636457 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5636458 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5636459 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5636460 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5636461 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5636462 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5636463 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5636464 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5636465 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5636466 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5636467 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5636468 we hope to have a model in place this season our opening up of the rights will certainly be done
5636469 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5636470 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5636471 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5636472 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5636473 i am hoping he will confirm that there is no doubt that team gb will be fully funded to the tune of the 600 million that as chancellor of the exchequer he announced in the budget two and a half years ago
5636474 we have an obligation to our affiliates and advertisers to show marquee sports at peak time when the us is watching
5636475 rights holders want to maximise viewership we will work this so everyone has the best opportunity to watch
5636476 we will make a proposal and submit it boxing is the only sport in the olympic programme without women and we believe we are ready
5636477 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5636478 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5636479 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5636480 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5636481 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5636482 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5636483 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5636484 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5636485 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5636486 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5636487 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5636488 we are pleased to reinforce our relationship with feg through this new deal and excited to extend our partnership to cover the rest of the world we are very confident that in five years we will not only be able to further propel the popularity of k 1 and dream in europe but we are also bullish that we are capable of growing its visibility and overall demand for fegs events in other emerging markets
5636489 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5636490 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5636491 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5636492 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5636493 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5636494 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5636495 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5636496 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5636497 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5636498 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5636499 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5636500 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5636501 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5636502 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5636503 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5636504 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5636505 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5636506 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5636507 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5636508 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5636509 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5636510 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5636511 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche

5636520 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5636521 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5636522 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5636523 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5636524 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5636525 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5636526 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5636527 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5636528 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5636529 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5636530 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5636531 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5636532 they are relatively okay when you are walking on a straight surface sitting down and standing up or walking up and down stairs is when the torture begins

5636748 this time it feels like i can actually make an impact at the world level
5636749 whereas before i was happy to go and happy with the experience ive definitely got a mission that ive got to accomplish
5636750 she was the first olympian from our school four years ago
5636751 the challenge was always to get her motivated and to push her
5636752 in 04 she raised herself far beyond where shed ever been before to make the team and that was a surprise
5636753 this time i knew the trials were just a stepping stone for her
5636754 i knew she had a real good shot at it
5636755 ive thought for awhile she had a chance to do gold it all comes down to the moment
5636756 we knew she had that potential since she was small
5636757 we were trying to get her to peak at the right time
5636758 in sports i think its one of the toughest things to be the best and to stay the best
5636759 she was always humble always helpful just a nice kid
5636760 when you work with athletes and youre around them there are the ones who have the big heads and there are the ones who are nice people and she was one of those nice people

5636769 raising awareness and funds to help sponsor orphans and filming genocide survivor testimonies
5636770 theres a lot of charges in there we dont think are entirely accurate
5636771 the need to implement new water capacity charges to increase revenues is directly related to the requirement to make new development pay for its share of the nacimiento bond debt payments treatment plant construction and other conveyance system improvements if revenues through new capacity charges to pay for new developments share of those costs are not sufficient the general fund will ultimately have to make up any shortfall
5636772 we want to know what were responsible for and well pay it
5636773 we are very concerned that the cost of gas is going to make it difficult for some residents to take advantage of educational opportunities
5636774 i think itll be a real learning experience to listen to a bunch of wonks talk about policy

5636788 this would be a huge beautiful jewel of open space
5636789 there would be potential housing some workforce housing some non workforce housing bike paths both passive and active open space
5636790 theres going to be a lot of back and forth up and down
5636791 it is quite common that parties with development interests hope for forward movement sooner rather than later and fear getting caught up in longer processes
5636792 those are two areas that are obviously off limits im just not sure
5636793 having healthy vibrant town centres that people visit and shop in is important to sustaining fifes communities and its economy we recognise that people will only use fifes town centres if they have the facilities attractions and shops they want to use
5636794 getting residents involved to compliment the last survey of visitors and businesses is vital and i would encourage everyone to take part so we can find out what you think of the town centres you use as residents so we can identify where improvements need to be made
5636795 its also a great opportunity to tell us what you dont like about the town centres and what stops you using them
5636796 again this will help us see what we need to put in place to entice people back to them

5636798 all that soil out there are plants that grew 6 000 years ago and didnt decompose completely
5636799 thats what peat is so were just making the same thing happen that happened here for millennia
5636800 we were capturing a lot of carbon dioxide at levels much greater than other systems marshes and forests grasslands
5636801 they can just sit back and watch the tules grow and they should be making money
5636802 thats what the vision is its not to do it just on twitchell island its to see if we can do it throughout the delta on subsided land
5636803 when oxygen is limited the bugs the microbes have to eat and breathe somehow
5636804 they will use sulfate iron or some other compound instead of producing carbon dioxide at the end of the pathway they end up producing methane
5636805 you probably wont be able to replicate it everywhere because we have a long growing season and we have very specific conditions that occur in the delta that dont occur worldwide
5636806 its not that we expect the san luis obispo county metro area to fall off the cliff
5636807 we just dont expect it to rebound sharply with the next year and a half
5636808 in some sense its just a silly quibble watkins said
5636809 for most people it feels like a recession whether or not it meets the technical definition
5636810 traditionally this area has been insulated and isolated he said
5636811 this is no different were seeing worse things happening in other parts of the state
5636812 businesses that were thinking about new directions or new product lines they might think this is the wrong time to jump into that he said
5636813 i also just think were all feeling the softening of everything when you have that happen that is when an economy suffers
5636814 a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months normally visible in real gross domestic product real income employment industrial production and wholesale retail sales
5636815 although theres often a lag behind other industries government does well in the good times and bad in the bad times
5636816 i expect more weakness to materialize in the next year

5636819 satu hal yang seringkali di lupakan oleh para pembuat kebijakan adalah permasalahan dengan napza tidak akan pernah selesai apabila kita tidak memecahkan masalah utamanya seperti kemiskinan tingginya angka pengangguran dan minimnya akses terhadap layanan publik
5636820 langkah menempatkan pengguna napza sebagai kriminal tidak tepat karena sebenarnya yang dibutuhkan adalah akses terhadap layanan layanan yang dapat membantu mereka pulih dari kecanduannya
5636821 masyarakat memang sering menganggap kami sampah ini tidak bisa disalahkan namun disatu sisi pengguna napza sangat membutuhkan dukungan komunitas bagaimanapun juga pecandu adalah warga negara yang memiliki persamaan hak dengan anggota masyarakat lainnya
5636822 dalam memperingati hari anti madat kali ini kami mencoba untuk mengajak masyarakat melihat pengguna napza dari sisi yang berbeda bukan sebagai kriminal melainkan sebagai korban yang perlu di tolong

5636845 fox has no financial risk here in a movie that could produce revenues for it as such i doubt that fox is going to force warner bros to shelve the movie
5636846 in all likelihood a settlement will be reached whereby warner bros gets to distribute the movie and fox gets a piece of the action
5636847 i assume fox is playing hardball to extract as much money as they can from the project but i cant imagine the movie itself would be blocked i dont know what the evidence is but it sounds like the individual producers are at the crux of the matter
5636848 the bad news is that its going to be an arduous process
5636849 the good news is that fox and warner bros have until march 2009 watchmens current release date to figure it out and come to a settlement

5636872 its a black and white answer or should i say a black green and yellow answer he said in the speech to be delivered in brisbane tonight
5636873 clean coal renewables and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future baseload clean energy mix
5636874 inconvenient truth that only nuclear power could provide baseload electricity while cutting emissions
5636875 burying mere tonnes of radioactive waste in geological stable rock was low risk
5636876 our view is that there needs to be consideration in australia given to the development of a nuclear power industry dr nelson said
5636877 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5636878 we cannot envisage any circumstance under which australia will have a nuclear power industry he said then
5636879 the last election showed that australians are absolutely of one mind about not having 25 nuclear power plants dotted around their suburbs and in and around their cities mr garrett said
5636880 are they really saying that they have a plan for 25 nuclear reactors in australia where are they going to put them senator wong said
5636881 australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources we have a lot of solar we have a lot of wind we have geothermal resources she said
5636882 we dont believe its appropriate for australia to go down the nuclear path

5636884 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were every difficult dr forster said
5636885 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5636886 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5636887 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said
5636888 we feel deep gratitude to the local villagers and authorities that assisted us

5636894 because something of the old legal disposition remains in us galatians serves to remind us of the ever present temptation to turn away from grace and revert back to our own merit
5636895 it is not easy to get the law killed something of a legal disposition remains even in the believer while he is in this world many a stroke does self and self righteousness get but still it revives again if he were wholly dead to the law he would be wholly dead to sin but so far as the law lives so far sin lives they that think they know the gospel well enough bewray their ignorance no man can be too evangelical it will take all his life time to get a legal temper destroyed though the believer be delivered wholly from the law in its commanding and condemning power and authority or its rightful power that it hath over all that are under it yet he is not delivered wholly from its usurped power which takes place many times upon him while here through remaining unbelief
5636896 i have taken in hand in the name of the lord yet once again to expound this epistle of st paul to the galatians not because i desire to teach new things or such as ye have not known before since that by the grace of christ paul is now thoroughly known unto you but for that we have to fear lest satan take from us this doctrine of faith and bring into the church again the doctrine of works and mens traditions wherefore it is very necessary that this doctrine be kept in continual practice and public exercise both of hearing and reading and although it be never so well known yet the devil who rageth continually seeking to devour us is not dead likewise our flesh and old man is yet alive besides this all kinds of temptations do vex and oppress us on every side so that this doctrine can never be taught urged and repeated enough if this doctrine be lost then is also the doctrine of truth life and salvation also lost and gone if this doctrine flourish then all good things flourish religion the true service of god the glory of god the right knowledge of all things which are necessary for a christian man to know
5636897 there is a strong disposition among mankind to rest in a mere nominal and external religion they mistake the appearance for the reality the name for the thing the expression for the signification the means for the end

5636923 wir haben noch nichts erreicht wir sind hierhergekommen um zu gewinnen
5636924 ich habe seit zw lf jahren angemahnt dass junge spieler gef rdert und gefordert werden m ssen da m ssen die spitzenvereine mehr tun sonst wird die situation die wir jetzt haben zur gewohnheit
5636925 wir haben die st rkste liga der welt aber die schl sselpositionen sind mit ausl ndern besetzt das ist das problem das wir gemeinsam mit der liga l sen m ssen
5636926 wenn es reglementiert werden k nnte w re es l ngst geschehen es gilt eine selbstbeschr nkung zu finden die allen gerecht wird
5636927 wir m ssen dahin kommen dass die jungen leute wenigstens auf den spielberichtsb gen stehen ob sie eingesetzt werden ist dann entscheidung des trainers
5636928 the first half in particular was not good enough we know that
5636929 it was tough for us at the start of the game they came out of the blocks really quickly and set a really high tempo which youd expect because it was their first home game of the season
5636930 they put us under a lot of pressure and maybe we were a little bit slow to get going
5636931 it was certainly not the best game we have played but the important thing was that we got better in the second half and at the end fernando popped up with a goal and that was enough to win the game
5636932 the most important thing is that we got the win we have had pre season and that was our first game in the league so it was good to get three points on the board and keep a clean sheet
5636933 i can guarantee we have 23 men who are ready to run through brick walls for each other
5636934 rio and john are both very similar with all the right attributes and well respected by the team
5636935 theyre both top internationals at the peak of their game very experienced vocal in the dressing room and lead by example
5636936 if mr capello wants someone who is going to go out there desperate to win and to do everything it takes then ill be his right choice
5636937 if not thats down to him to make the decision
5636938 i have the support of at least one of the owners i sent e mails to all of them but he was clear we had the money
5636939 if the manager has an idea and it is not a question of money we have to make the right decision in terms of who we bring in that has to be the decision of the manager
5636940 ok im dropping by your house because i have something for you
5636941 the bookmakers dont rate norwich citys chances for promotion this season and one company has him down as a 16 1 shot to be the first championship manager to be sacked this season roeder is rated at 16 1 to get the elbow from carrow road although its another former west ham manager alan pardew who skybet reckon could be the first to pick up his p45 charlton boss pardew is rated a 5 1 joint favourite with southamptons new man jan poortvliet to win this seasons championship sack race iain dowie whose new role as manager of money club queens park rangers has begun with a win and a defeat is third favourite at 11 2 while derby boss paul jewell is rated at 6 1 dowie has been the subject of much speculation since taking over at loftus road with reports of a row with joint owner flavio briatore while jewells start to the season has been interrupted by similar claims the heat is on them both to produce given the finances available he is among the dark horses behind owen coyle brian laws colin calderwood and paul sturrock although he will be none too pleased at being judged on his rebuilt teams performances just two matches into the campaign
5636942 ledesma has great charisma and is a fans favourite already and rightly so because hes so great to watch such great ability
5636943 he was the most special player i saw when i went to italy to watch a tournament in the summer and thankfully flavio briatore then managed to get that one over the line and bring the player here
5636944 as for dani parejo you dont play for real madrid without being a good player and his set piece delivery was sensational
5636945 il giocatore stato visionato a vasto durante le finali del campionato primavera dal ds paladini dal consulente di marzio e dallo stesso dowie la decisione del suo ingaggio stata presa di comune accordo da tutto lo staff tecnico del queens park ranger per cui ogni eventuale dissidio tra tecnico e societ non ha niente a che vedere con la campagna acquisti del club londinese ed in particolar modo con lacquisto di samuel di carmine
5636946 the player was viewed at vasto during the finals of the championship spring by ds paladini the consultant di marzio and the same dowie
5636947 i think when you look at the quality of the players we have we surely should be up there but as weve seen before it doesnt always work out like that in the championship
5636948 its not always the team who have the better players who win the league
5636949 also the league should be harder than it was last year because when you look at the teams whove come up with big ambitions like swansea nottingham forest and doncaster and the teams who came down from the premiership it looks tougher than ever
5636950 but i think we just need to keep going and keep improving and at the end of the season well see where we are i think were capable not only of top six but winning the league
5636951 i dont think we played the best football we can play with the quality we have in our squad
5636952 i think we started really really nervously all of us including me but as the game went on we performed better and better
5636953 we have a lot of things to work on after this game but its always nice to get the first game over with three points thats the most important thing
5636954 i think it might be the case that big expectations played a part in the nerves but i think its always the case in the first game because you want to play as well as you can and sometimes that doesnt work and you get nervous
5636955 i think it should be ok in the next couple of games
5636956 the most important was the first game and fitz scored two goals maybe next time i can do something similar
5636957 i didnt go for corners today because they had three men up front all the time but hopefully in the next couple of games i can improve that
5636958 i was confident i was going to end up at qpr but i was nervous about how long it was taking
5636959 at first i thought it shouldnt be a problem but then it took longer and longer and somebody even told me i might miss the august dead line and that wasnt a pleasant time for me
5636960 obviously i was very frustrated i cant say that i fell out with my old club but i was disappointed at how long they were taking to resolve it but now its behind me and im looking forward
5636961 richard is available on a free and we will take a look at him in todays reserve game

5636967 obama objectively did extremely well with warren in the first hour
5636968 if they arent going to be on stage together im not even going to watch
5636969 they have tried to get a few but for one reason or another it has not worked but i think for the next five years that could be our central partnership
5636970 coloccini has signed for five years and so has steven so everything is there the signs are good from the first game we hope they can build
5636971 a lot of players would come off after the knock he had at old trafford so i have said to him watch and learn from this guy coloccini and he will help you
5636972 and he will learn if he does he will make the step up again from the under 21s to where coloccini is at full international level
5636973 he wants to learn that is the key some young players dont but he does
5636974 he has only trained with the players once but when you have played for argentina for 20 odd games coming to old trafford wont faze you
5636975 he has played in brazil in front of bigger crowds this summer i had no option because i lost claudio ca apa on friday but i did not have any worries about it i just told him to go out there and enjoy it and i think he did
5636976 he said afterwards it was very quick and he can normally get more passes through but i told him that was the premier league what he needs to learn he will learn very quickly
5636977 we were without michael owen and mark viduka who are key players for us but there were two very committed teams
5636978 if my team can handle that on the first day of the premier league why should they fear anyone else
5636979 the fitness coaches have got them really fit so i wasnt worried about us lasting 90 minutes the good thing was that players who got knocks did not want to come off
5636980 steve taylor got one and damien duff and one or two others that tells you all you need to know about the desire within the squad we are not a big squad but we are trying 100
5636981 we have agreed a fee with newcastle for shola and he spent yesterday at the club having a medical weve had a good chat and things are moving on
5636982 he will be with us again today and hopefully we can get it all tied up

5637034 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5637035 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5637036 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5637037 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5637038 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5637039 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5637040 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5637041 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5637042 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5637043 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5637044 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5637045 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

5637047 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5637048 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5637049 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5637050 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5637051 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5637052 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5637053 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5637054 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5637055 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5637056 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5637057 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5637058 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5637059 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5637060 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5637061 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5637062 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5637063 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5637064 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5637065 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5637066 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5637067 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5637068 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5637069 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5637070 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5637071 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5637072 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5637073 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5637074 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5637075 chinas stellar growth in renewables can be attributed to the speed at which it has built up its supply chain capability to the point where it is likely to have nine gigawatts of manufacturing capacity in a few years
5637076 china is also likely to become a significant exporter of wind turbine equipment in a few years adding to its already strong presence in the solar industry

5637080 die finanzmarktexperten haben sich von der negativen zuwachsrate im zweiten quartal zu recht nicht sonderlich beeindrucken lassen
5637081 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5637082 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5637083 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5637084 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5637085 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5637086 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

5637090 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5637091 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5637092 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5637093 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5637094 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5637095 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5637096 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5637097 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5637098 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5637099 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

5637105 overall the environment for equity markets remains very difficult as it has now become clearer that we are witnessing a more severe economic slowdown
5637106 the strength in the dollar index has little to do with dollar strength but more the weakness of the other currencies
5637107 the markets focus is just very one sided at the moment the market has decided to focus on the weakness of the euro zone and hasnt taken a balanced view of risks in the u s
5637108 eu autommobile production decreases both gold and platinum continue to be bearish platinum may be below 1 200
5637109 from the charts platinum seemed to have returned the premiums from the earlier south africa crisis and in fact we are almost at one year lows i am looking at the 1 200 1 250 region for support now
5637110 general sentiment for gold remains weak and i guess we are likely to see more selling on strength for near term support i am currently looking at the 770 region
5637111 if we move below that then the 750s will be a very important level to look at
5637112 there is strong support for prices to drift lower towards 100 a barrel we are only about 10 a barrel away and i wont be surprised to see 105 a barrel by next month

5637129 oh well i work at the offices of mr penscratcher over there
5637130 he thought it might be useful to his business to have me come along and mingle
5637131 there really is nothing like a good mingle you know
5637132 i still cannot believe you pushed mr penscratcher into that fountain
5637133 well the man was clearly an oaf furthermore he positively reeked of pork and sweat i figured he could rather do with a bath

5637138 i thought it best to keep her away from any room containing cutlery
5637139 right i shall have to hide dear dorothy from sight for the moment while i sort out this mess i dare say that if maud caught me with another woman i would wind up on the gallows before you could say well hung you go and keep maud entertained in the meantime

5637169 i was very amazed and annoyed to see the police only charging mugisha who was found with nothing yet nelima who had exhibits was moving scot free instead the police told me that she had misused the exhibit and was told to refund the money she had loaded on her phone

5637171 eight out of 10 people in the recent life and times survey highlighted that they would like to live in mixed areas
5637172 it is a very ambitious programme and the key to it for me is that it will be community led when i launched my new housing agenda earlier this year i made it clear that i wanted to provide housing that would bring people together not keep them apart
5637173 this remains a central theme in all my endeavours for housing and that is why i am delighted to help launch this programme starting the first of many schemes
5637174 supporting and encouraging neighbourhoods where everyone in the community is valued and respected and where diversity is celebrated is fundamental to building lasting peace and a stable society in northern ireland
5637175 good community relations is a major priority for the international fund and we are pleased to have been able to work with the housing executive to develop this uniquely proactive approach to promoting shared neighbourhoods
5637176 the shared neighbourhood programme acknowledges for the first time those communities who have been quietly working towards becoming genuinely shared spaces often with little or no funding and provides them with support to share their experiences capture best practice and ensure that their work is sustained for future generations
5637177 without the support of our international donors the united states the european union canada australia and new zealand we could not continue to fund programmes such as the shared neighbourhood programme
5637178 the programme recognises the expertise leadership and good relations work that is already taking place within communities
5637179 its aim to galvanise long term commitment from statutory and interagency partnerships will be crucial in supporting securing and protecting shared neighbourhoods through a spirit of true partnership working

5637202 investors may think that they are buying into a weak market but as this research shows rental yields are on the increase and buy to let investors have a great opportunity to capitalise on the increasing demand for student accommodation whilst taking advantage of lower house prices
5637203 there will always be a sustained demand for properties which will produce a far greater annual rental yield than the average buy to let property
5637204 in fact it could be as much as six to seven per cent more
5637205 we have reported the matter to police and it is under investigation to establish the motive behind stealing the district payroll and one person has been arrested and charged with neglect of duty

5637434 while the bhp outer harbour proposal would increase opportunities for junior producers the strength of global demand for iron ore makes a range of alternatives possible

5637449 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
5637450 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
5637451 the notion that christianity in general and evangelicalism in particular are by nature right wing creeds has always been wrong how can a faith built around a commitment to the poor and the vulnerable be seen as leading ineluctably to conservative political conclusions
5637452 it was mccains night obama made no big mistakes but his tendency to somewhat windy generalities meant he wasnt particularly compelling mccain who went second was crisp by contrast and his anecdotes colorful
5637453 members of the orange order belong to the institution because they are firmly committed to their reformed protestant faith and in a world where secular values are changing the societies in which we live our faith is important to us
5637454 they might think they are being smart issuing that type of answer but it is showing that they are burying their heads in the sand many members have been very positive about the suggestion internally but nothing has happened at an official level yet
5637455 were a pro protestant organisation not an anti catholic one were an all ireland body and we have members in nine counties in the republic
5637456 the biennial pew research center report on changing news audiences describes 13 of the us public as

5637463 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
5637464 it does not appear to be new semtex so it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply of semtex
5637465 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
5637466 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
5637467 but when it semtex was passed over to different groups how it came to be in their possession i dont know at this point in time
5637468 bid to exert control in nationalist areas in particular is continuing unabated
5637469 in the decade up to 2006 residential property prices in ireland rose more rapidly than in any other developed economy strong demand partly explains this incomes employment and population all grew robustly the increase in the supply of new housing was just as phenomenal the number of annual housing completions in 2006 was almost five times that of the early 1990s which compares with static output in the euro area and in the uk however when supply and demand fundamentals are considered in tandem the enormous increase in prices was unjustified consequently the countrys property market is now going sharply into reverse prices have been falling for 18 months and excess supply makes further declines all but inevitable in the event of an even sharper correction than is currently predicted the main lenders would probably suffer badly although irelands banks have been highly profitable over a long period and are thus well capitalised they are hugely exposed to the domestic property market the international credit crisis should it continue could cause serious financing problems for the banks adding to concerns about their balance sheets

5637479 he wanted to come round to the house to pay his respects but i didnt want that and we met in the hotel since then we have communicated intermittently over the years and i did meet him with gerry adams and gerry kelly but that meeting was not a terribly good one
5637480 nothing came of it and i was very disappointed by the response from adams in particular on friday i decided to send a text to martin mcguinness to again ask him to give that vital assistance and urge his fellow republicans to give the information that would convict the bombers but again he wouldnt agree to that but when sinn fein does take that step it will show that they are genuinely into peace and a system of justice which should protect everybody catholic and protestant

5637512 luther took the hidden god seriously for a number of reasons
5637513 in the heidelberg disputation luther had focused first on the blank wall created by the impossibility of the human creatures to say nothing of sinners conceptualizing of god just to prove that with fallen eyes no one can see god with fallen human ears no one can return to the edenic hearing of his word then luther focused very sharply on god in his revelation of himself john 1 18 no one has seen god but jesus of nazareth god in the flesh has made him known a god with holes in his hands feet and side the god who has come near to humankind into the midst of its twisted and ruined existence

5637515 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5637516 were the only industry of this size and scope that doesnt have a real voice in this process at best were humored at worst were ignored
5637517 is it making our community stronger or are we trapped in that model
5637518 the philanthropic dollars provide us the money to experiment and try new things
5637519 philanthropy can fail in a way that government cant but we can catalyze government investment in growing what works
5637520 there are a lot of people in this sector who will get nervous about the federal government becoming too engaged in philanthropy
5637521 but theres also this other argument that we dont want an agency that is going to over regulate us
5637522 we will continue to do all we can to protect core services but the need for tough decisions will require examination of all areas of state spending
5637523 we have held public education harmless from the effects of the slowing economy and as a result school divisions are about to begin a new school year with significant increases in state funding
5637524 the need to engage in a third round of budget reductions will mean by necessity that all programs including those previously held harmless will be on the table for review
5637525 by entering new markets especially alt a and subprime and guaranteeing more of our customers products at market prices we met our goal of increasing market share from 22 to 25 percent
5637526 i think the concept what it is supposed to be is great but its not working
5637527 im amazed we have surpassed the goal i really am
5637528 but as we look at how weve done its clear that where we have knocked it out of the park has been an increase in procurement for small businesses im not yet happy where the numbers are for women owned and minority owned businesses the numbers have improved pretty steadily since i came in but they are still not at the level that i am happy with
5637529 there isnt a lot of volume so though were down a lot i dont think it necessarily signifies a change in sentiment
5637530 its healthy in these kinds of markets for people to have time to breathe or take time to consolidate before you continue the uptrend
5637531 regarding the treasurys new authorities the secretary has said many times he has no intentions of using it
5637532 continue to provide stability and liquidity to the housing market
5637533 i dont think they want to use it or intend to use it but the market is basically providing its own view that in the end the treasury department will have to be the source of that capital

5637594 make the decision to take action and move closer to your dream create daily success habits and surround yourself with information that will empower and inspire you
5637595 anger is a normal reaction its what you do with anger that makes a difference in your life direct your anger towards a goal use anger in a positive way to get results from anger comes determination comes triumph
5637596 visualize your dream and make a commitment having a dream is what makes life exciting never underestimate the power of a dream it will change your life a dream gives you the ability to determine your future
5637597 find mentors who encourage you the right information will eliminate confusion visualize exactly what you want to be and focus on that believe in yourself and dont let anything stop you reinforce your dream every day with positive information from tapes books and mentors each day you will get closer to your dream eliminate the confusion and fears and make it happen
5637598 most people allow struggles and fear of failure to stop them the key is to learn from your struggles and move on failures will make you stronger and give you the information you need to reach your dream struggle will prepare you for success without struggle there is no success
5637599 theres nothing wrong with making money but its important to focus on your passion instead of the dollar for me decisions based on my passion brought me closer to my dream while decisions based only on money took me further away if you focus on what really fulfills you you will have success the dollar alone does not bring happiness
5637600 what were really talking about here is commitment until you make a commitment to your dream its not really a dream its just another fantasy full of excuses fantasies dont come true because theyre not real were not committed to them when we make commitments we eliminate excuses and they become dreams and dreams are definitely real
5637601 preparation is what comes from struggle knowledge comes from preparation these are the elements that pave the road to your dream if we do not prepare we will not succeed set your goals and pursue your dreams with all your heart if you miss a goal dont quit reset it you just need to learn more step by step you will win

5637661 while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio fuel
5637662 but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic

5637670 the bonds given to fertiliser companies are quoting at a discount of about 15 per cent so a bond with a face value of rs 100 will fetch only rs 85 this amounts to the government paying only rs 85 against the dues of rs 100
5637671 the companies are asking for delivered costs of fertilisers they have to give cash to raw inputs providers transporters and others moreover when they deposit tax they will have to give it in cash so what they need is cash and not bonds
5637672 delayed disbursement of concession means protracted recovery period of the major portions of cost already incurred by the fertiliser companies this seriously affects cash flows of fertiliser companies
5637673 in the last one week we did three times more sales than what we were clocking in the first half of this year
5637674 if the demand continues like this we jewellers will run out of gold stocks
5637675 i am getting a lot of inquiries from people wanting to buy gold after the fall in prices
5637676 jewellery prices have fallen now and given the way prices are fluctuating i plan to buy gold jewellery this week
5637677 but we are now seeing strong and growing demand at lower prices in the worlds largest gold buying market of india and believe international investment demand in the retail coins and bars market will also strengthen
5637678 i certainly hope the prices fall further as this is boosting demand
5637679 the price spike had hit our sales hard and a correction in prices was long overdue
5637680 the gold market situation is now crazy the fluctuation in prices are affecting our business
5637681 people are buying gold at this price but it all depends on the global market
5637682 you cant make a judgement now on future rates as one of the key determinant of prices is the us dollar
5637683 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5637684 the patience of our soldiers in trying to uphold the primacy of the peace process is very commendable but at some point we really have to act decisively

5637693 i am not asking for anything i will let the people of pakistan decide my future
5637694 strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5637695 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5637696 most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5637697 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5637698 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5637699 if he made a decision to go or fight against it we didnt advise him either way
5637700 we really did keep our fingers out of this one
5637701 after the elections the nation wanted solutions from the new government
5637702 but the politicians could not do so a personal vendetta was started
5637703 i am confident that not a single charge can stand against me
5637704 i have not done anything for my personal gain whatever i have done i have done it for pakistan
5637705 leading pakistan is not an easy task and anyone doing it comes under a lot of criticism
5637706 in the start most pakistanis were for him and he still has some supporters especially because the new government which promised to do things differently has failed to do much in the past 100 days in power
5637707 he wanted to serve the country and to be different
5637708 he brought parliamentary reforms he brought women into the parliament
5637709 he in a way always believed in a unity of command a very centralized command which means his command in fact

5638088 i tell you what would be brilliant we should have sir roger moore just singing mouthing the words in a chair
5638089 i dont want anything to do with this industry it absolutely stinks
5638090 im gonna go out having told the truth and with my head held high and having stood for something
5638091 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of
5638092 you get these bands who have a few hits say like the pigeon detectives who come out with another album trying to do the same thing again
5638093 im going to make a record thats truly artistic which is the reverend and the makers album thats artistically interesting then im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
5638094 its all done for profit and not for any degree of musical feeling or sentiment
5638095 and the press distort things to such a degree that youve not got a hope of knowing what the truth is so its not something that i want to participate in or fuel anymore
5638096 when i saw the skull i knew i just had to have it it was meant to be as it even has my hair colour

5638099 the decision has been forced to be made on the grounds of health and safety with very little option to the organising committee
5638100 were very disappointed that weve had to make this decision but im sure everyone will understand that its in the safety interests of spectators and those involved with the rally
5638101 people can still get close to the cars at the ramp in penrith town centre and everyone is very welcome to come and watch there we ask that spectators kindly respect this decision
5638102 it was very important to get both cars to the finish with a view to scoring championship points and after junes le mans 24 hours it was also important for st phane and me to get back onto the podium theres nothing like winning i am really delighted with this result because there were no team orders which goes to show what a sporting team peugeot is
5638103 its a fantastic result for us and for the whole team
5638104 our car was perfectly balanced and the mechanics did a terrific job which enabled us to claim our second win of year following our victory at monza we had a good fight with the n 7 car and there was never much in it so nobody could afford to make a mistake
5638105 das ist nicht schlecht es gibt kaum industrien die das schaffen

5638113 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5638114 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said
5638115 we feel deep gratitude to the local villagers and authorities that assisted us

5638122 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5638123 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5638124 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of this cease fire and should be removed immediately
5638125 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5638126 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5638127 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5638128 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5638129 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5638130 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5638131 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5638132 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5638133 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5638134 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5638135 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5638136 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5638137 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5638138 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5638139 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5638140 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5638141 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5638142 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5638143 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5638144 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5638147 disappointed with our performance at e3 and how she wished nintendo had announced pikmin 3 on stage
5638148 i would say the message is we were disappointed with our performance at e3
5638149 there were titles like wario which we think will be really fun titles that we should have showcased we were excited that mr miyamoto made the commitment that pikmin is coming it would have been nice if we could have said that on stage
5638150 you guys know im a disappointed cynic when it comes to video games evoking subtle emotions in players
5638151 but ill tell you what from what i saw on friday these guys gals at tgc are well on their way to having made one of the most emotional games of all time
5638152 and if the whole game feels like the stuff i saw last week well wow just wow and the coolest thing to me is hell now im inspired to step up to the plate and try to do something a bit more meaningful as well maybe not with our current title but one day soon
5638153 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5638154 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5638155 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5638156 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5638157 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5638158 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5638159 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5638160 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5638161 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5638162 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5638163 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5638164 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5638165 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5638166 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5638167 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5638168 who are open to doing something on the production side
5638169 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5638170 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5638171 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5638172 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5638173 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5638174 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5638175 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5638176 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5638177 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5638178 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5638179 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5638180 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5638181 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5638182 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5638183 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5638184 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5638185 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5638186 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5638187 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5638188 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5638189 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5638190 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5638191 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5638192 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5638193 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5638194 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5638195 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5638196 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5638197 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5638198 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5638199 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5638200 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5638201 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5638202 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5638203 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5638204 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5638205 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5638206 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5638207 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5638208 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
5638209 the continuation of the awakening councils as they are now is unacceptable
5638210 we fought the americans for four years and we fought al qaeda too
5638211 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
5638212 america is being overrun by an invasion force from mexico
5638213 america is being overrun by an invasion force from mexico thatll soon take over the country
5638214 and you think the gang banger with baggy pants is going to pay for your retirement you liberal fools you think that theyre going to pay for your housing in a senior citizens center you psychotic liberals dont even know youre digging your own grave and throwing lime in there all thats missing is the worm from the tequila bottle to go with it

5638216 runs threshold a new conservative publishing imprint at simon amp schuster
5638217 i f we kept the payroll tax exactly the same but applied it to all earnings and not just the first 97 500 we could virtually eliminate the entire social security shortfall
5638218 i think mccain really did something extraordinary when the way he answered that question so he put it out there he acknowledged it and he sort of inoculated himself against it
5638219 mccain has acknowledged that he was not faithful in his first marriage but not necessarily before a national television audience
5638220 shows the power of his biography and a new willingness to publicly discuss it
5638221 today is a bitter sweet day for the trust because tornado is leaving darlington after 11 years of construction
5638222 however she is now ready to stretch her legs on the great central railway britains only double track mainline heritage railway where she will be tested at speeds of up to 60mph in preparation for her network rail debut in the autumn
5638223 this is a terrific honour for the gcr tornado has been the talk of the railway enthusiast community for years but now shes finally ready to run
5638224 kenny is looking very good hes just concentrating on himself and his performance in the ring he knows hes going to have to be clinical but hes a better boxer than silva
5638225 on the law of averages youd have to fancy him
5638226 if they need to break from the monotony and go shopping or something thats what they do
5638227 but were all only human here of course we feel the pressure and anxiety building personally id be happy to be heading home now with medals around their necks but you have to earn an olympic medal and thats what were hoping we will do
5638228 we have a few boys with premier league experience and they will help the guys like myself who have never played in the premier league
5638229 in many ways it is like the northern ireland squad we dont have lots of individuals our success will be built on working as a unit
5638230 we all work hard for each other and that is what got us the results in the euro 2008 qualifiers
5638231 obviously its dave healy who puts the ball in the back of the net but i think he will be the first one to tell you its everyone else working hard in behind him to provide him with the goal scoring opportunities
5638232 with northern ireland we have had to change how we play to make sure we achieve success and i will have to look at it for both my club and country this season if we are going to have success
5638233 the result maybe isnt as important as the performance on wednesday its all about getting the lads together and working on things with an eye on slovakia
5638234 its a tough start for us and our away form has not been great over the last few years
5638235 this wont really feel like a proper away game though and im sure it will give us the opportunity to implement things we will need to do when the qualifiers begin
5638236 its a derby too which is good and there will be a bit of banter and bragging rights up for grabs
5638237 my west brom team mate james morrison is in the scotland squad and im sure there will be a few text messages swapped before wednesday
5638238 hopefully itll not be like that every week everton are next up and the main thing for us will be to get some points on the board as soon as possible
5638239 i think we are capable on finishing in mid table but i will be looking for us to do what the likes wigan and reading did when they were promoted and we can then build from there
5638240 we cant play off the cuff as much as last season but what we do in training will be vital just like what we do with northern ireland
5638241 for me it looks as if it came from old stocks as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
5638242 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5638243 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5638244 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairytale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5638245 hes actually returning us to the dark ages and making the guys that live in this town seem like sex starved men that will pounce upon the first girl they see
5638246 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything
5638247 theres a lot of anger among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger
5638248 weve got a saying up here that the odds are good but the goods are odd
5638249 well have a look at the situation appoint a committee and take it from there the national league isnt until february we have plenty of time
5638250 he has given a huge service both as a player to his club na fianna and to dublin and he brought a huge level of professionalism to his approach to the game despite the fact that he worked purely as an amateur
5638251 his record speaks for itself as manager of the dublin team that won four leinster titles on the trot but unfortunately we are still that one step away from reaching an all ireland final
5638252 im very disappointed for paul and all the management team and indeed the players who have given outstanding service
5638253 i can only do what i do and not worry about the rest
5638254 i dont know how old she is but i do know that she gave a performance that merited her medal
5638255 obviously im gutted but last sunday i didnt think id even be competing because of a rib injury so im pleased just to make the final
5638256 the dismount probably did cost me my place on the podium
5638257 my dismount is normally not a problem but i just didnt get enough height and to be honest i thought i was going to end up on my face
5638258 she went for tests and results have come back and she has cancer of the womb
5638259 she was phoned up and informed this is a massive blow for her
5638260 it is unbelievable how life is so unpredictable and finds a way to distract and derail you from your plans
5638261 my prayers are with jade her family in this hour when they face one of the biggest tests of their life in times ahead
5638262 i pray she comes out of this soon and stronger with happy memories from this country
5638263 if each one of us does our bit we will be able to keep global warming from harming our countries
5638264 but i dont know if its not too late already
5638265 sunlight opened up my eyes and tonight rivers will run dry hundreds of years in the future there could be computers looking for life on earth dont fight for the wrong side ask who does this belong to
5638266 he is wrong when he claims flash flooding during the summer has not been predicted by climate change modelling
5638267 in research commissioned by the ministers own department the northern ireland executive was warned about the increased risk of flash flooding and subsequent impacts on urban infrastructure including transport
5638268 i warned when these planning applications came before omagh district council a few years ago that they were within the flood plain of the cloughfin river and there was a risk of flooding in the event of exceptional rainfall sadly this has now happened
5638269 newcastle has had three 1 in 100 year events in the last eight years a lot of councillors and mlas have been extremely irresponsible in lobbying to have that 1 in 100 year rule relaxed and what that inevitably leads to is the sort of situation that arose this weekend with all the building and hardstanding the inevitable happens the water runs off very quickly and causes huge damage to property a lot of housing estates have been built on land where they should never have been started
5638270 we are getting more violent peaks and troughs in our weather and this is happening in june july and august
5638271 i think the one in 100 rule will have to be revised mlas councillors and mps will have to be responsible and when developers come pleading to build on a flood plain the answer must be no
5638272 cities are water traps designed to create the maximum amount of flooding as the water has nowhere to go
5638273 in former times the water would have sat in the wetlands and in the peat on the mountains and been released slowly into watercourses now it comes from the mountains to the sea in record time and we need to ensure we dont build any more property in areas where they are going to be flooded or make flooding more likely
5638274 but i have a gin and tonic every now and again i find it helps me to mind my own business would you like one
5638275 you can take the hardest rock band on the earth and they sound like a bunch of girls next to the dubliners
5638276 it was certainly a great bonus for me to have been involved against dublin and obviously i would love to keep my place in the side but that is a decision for the manager prior to the game dublin had been rated as warm favourites and i was particularly pleased to share in what was a very satisfying win for tyrone
5638277 pearse og had players like ronan clarke in action who had played for armagh against wexford and the outcome of that game must serve as a big warning to tyrone we know that while we will be made favourites we are in for a very tough time wexford not only beat armagh but they will have learned a great deal from that game into the bargain which will now stand to them
5638278 manager mickey harte and captain brain dooher have been warning us that there is a long way to go we are keeping our guard up for wexford thats the big one
5638279 it was a bit of an anti climax how it happened but im not going to complain about that i definitely started better and i think i was going to do him whatever happened
5638280 but i did feel the pressure all week id felt great and then it suddenly dawned on me how important it was to get a medal and fight through to the final
5638281 i didnt really know what had happened when the fight was stopped
5638282 i just said thank god he had been a thorn in my side in the past
5638283 cammarelle took me off the road to athens but i wasnt mature then
5638284 im mature now maybe not fully mature but enough to do this job
5638285 they asked for guidelines for living a christian life not for an outline of your personal issues
5638286 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5638287 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5638288 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5638289 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5638290 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5638297 it is the boards responsibility placed on it by the government to provide information for people mainly parents with young children
5638298 i think part of the problem is that the bbfc is an industry body rather than a public body
5638299 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5638300 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan

5638340 to succeed here you really do have to believe it will happen and really see yourself being able to do it but the reality is theres a lot of great people out there trying to get the same thing and its not likely to happen youre going against the odds to be able to pull it off

5638344 i wanted to start crying it was a huge goal
5638345 both teams were going all out for it this is what we have been training for all year to keep up with any team today
5638346 the girls fought a good fight we knew it was going to be a tough game but our girls came back from 8 5 down at the end of the third quarter that was incredible

5638383 the most senior bush administration officials discussed and approved specific details of how high value al qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the central intelligence agency
5638384 what happened at abu ghraib was no aberration but part of a widespread pattern it showed the tragic impact of the initial decision by mr bush and his top advisers that they were not going to follow the geneva conventions or indeed american law for prisoners taken in antiterrorist operations the investigative file on bagram showed that the mistreatment of prisoners was routine shackling them to the ceilings of their cells depriving them of sleep kicking and hitting them sexually humiliating them and threatening them with guard dogs the very same behavior later repeated in iraq
5638385 under the geneva convention it is the united states as a nation which must confront its responsibility for the actions of the men and women representing it in its prisons
5638386 the us justice system is based on the abiding principle that defendants are innocent until proven guilty we would encourage you to remain open minded but skeptical of sensational allegations that have no basis in fact
5638387 there is also the grotesque and deeply shameful issue that will always be a part of americas legacy the manner in which american troops have treated prisoners under their control in iraq afghanistan and guant namo bay cuba there is no longer any doubt that large numbers of troops responsible for guarding and interrogating detainees somehow loosed their moorings to humanity and began behaving as sadists perverts and criminals

5638397 due to our culture of stokvels which are informal investment clubs typically run in the townships and villages women outside the formal economy were able to invest in these initiatives as a long term strategy over and above putting their savings in interest bearing bank accounts

5638412 dear everyone i guess no one would have seen this coming but as of the end of august i will no longer be drumming for paradise lost i have decided to hang up my sticks altogether it is an incredibly hard decision to have had to make as drumming has been my life for as long as i can remember and through good and bad has been my living for nearly 20 years it is going to be very difficult i am sure and after four and a half years i will miss milly very much but in my heart i know that it is the correct thing for me to do so why am i leaving well to be honest it is a difficult thing to explain in a few paragraphs but here goes i am sure you are aware that the record industry is struggling and i for one have become increasingly disillusioned with the music business as a whole i feel incredibly lucky to have traveled so much in my career i have so many fantastic memories and have had a ton of priceless experiences i have made friendships that will last a lifetime and i wouldnt change anything however to have survived in this business for so long has meant great sacrifice and i have had to move the goalposts over the years to help make things happen and try and survive through some pretty hard times more and more is being taken away and it is getting harder and harder to make excuses for why i do this we toured so hard this past year we were basically away for five out of six months and are still out as we speak in past years i wouldnt be bothered but as a 37 year old man with a family now for me it has just been too tough my sons are 1 and 3 and being away from them has just been too painful i asked myself if i could see myself leaving them again for a three month stretch and the answer was no i couldnt i realised there was no point in having a family if i wasnt there and that is how it has to be sad as it is losing my brother two years ago showed me that there is no point in having regrets or feeling that you should have said more or done more carpe diem and all that coincidentally whilst i was thinking about my future i confided in my best friend who ended up offering me a job which will provide me with a good career and future which for a 37 year old man with nothing but drumming behind him was an offer too good to pass up i appreciate the timing of my departure is terrible but september 1st was the start date for the job and i must go through with that in requiem i have gone out on a high it has been a fantastic two years recording and touring for the album and to tour america with nightwish the way we did fulfilled a life long dream for me not a day goes by now without me thinking about that tour and it will always be with me until the day i die paradise lost and i wish you heartfelt good luck for the future i also thank all the great musicians i have played and toured with since 1986 and especially all the fans who have made it all worthwhile i am sure everyone will understand and respect my decision jeffo
5638413 it is with regret that we have to announce the cancellation of our south american tour sincere apologies to all the fans and promoters involved but this decision follows the announcement of the departure of our drummer

5638422 evidence based clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend that elderly trauma patients be treated as aggressively as non elderly patients
5638423 however some studies have suggested that age bias may still exist in trauma care even in the prehospital phase of that care
5638424 the problem of age bias raised in this study may negate efforts to improve clinical care for elderly trauma patients within trauma centers if the system as a whole does not function properly and deliver patients appropriately to needed resources
5638425 however it may be difficult to change attitudes of age bias and may require a broad societal campaign nevertheless it may be possible to address this problem without directly addressing age bias a focus on retraining the providers about triage protocols may be sufficient
5638426 additionally it may be helpful to highlight the literature that now suggests that elderly trauma patients do in fact return to productive lives after their injury which can eliminate the perception of futility of care that may be used consciously or subconsciously to justify age bias

5638430 but as they enjoy the games from the comfort of their seats at the olympic stadium they should reflect on their failure to speak up for the chinese citizens who built the stadium and their hotels clean their hotel rooms serve their meals or in the case of chinese journalists try to bring them their news
5638431 that is the role of human rights organizations in this respect we are from mars youre from venus
5638432 ge seeks to advance human rights by leading by example through our interactions with customers and suppliers the products we offer and our relationships with communities and governments
5638433 i believe the olympics are a force for good and if they were not a force for good we would not sponsor them
5638434 being a good corporate sponsor of the beijing games has sadly not meant being a good corporate citizen
5638435 the sponsors silence has only emboldened the chinese government and allowed the ioc to ignore the human rights standards it claims to uphold
5638436 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5638437 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5638438 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5638439 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
5638440 recently approved pesticides have been implicated in massive bee die offs and are the focus of increasing scientific scrutiny
5638441 epa should be evaluating the risks to bees before approving new pesticides but now refuses to tell the public what it knows pesticide restrictions might be at the heart of the solution to this growing crisis so why hide the information they should be using to make those decisions
5638442 epa needs to help shed some light so that researchers can get to work on this problem this isnt just an issue for farmers this is an issue that concerns us all just try to imagine a pizza without the contribution of bees no tomatoes no cheese no peppers if you eat apples cucumbers broccoli onions squash carrots avocados or cherries you need to be concerned
5638443 the roofscapes of our cities are the last urban frontier from 15 percent to 35 percent of the total land area and the green roof industry can turn these wasted spaces into a force for cleaner air cleaner water energy savings cooling beauty and recreation

5638449 there hasnt been a ban on kenchic products the cabinet issued a certificate of clearance some time ago
5638450 the main problem with ugandan players is that when they are audited by kenyan veterinary and health authorities and advised of measures to take to become compliant they see this as sort of a non tarriff barrier
5638451 what we all need to understand is that the east african community set up does not abrogate the need to maintain international standards in food safety and trade in animal products
5638452 this is particularly important in this era of bird flu which can decimate a countrys entire poultry industry
5638453 after you have applied they tell you to come back for the permit which they do not issue they instead keeping putting you off
5638454 ugandas ban followed the bse scare and the situation is still being studied to ensure safety and traceability
5638455 two years ago there was food for aid but today with a global food shortage the situation is grim people are reducing their food intake we only have months before we go into a major crisis
5638456 the situation is worse than it has been for a very long time lives and livelihoods are under threat and the rates of malnutrition are scary the combination of existing drought and conflict compounded by skyrocketing food prices are aggravating an already serious situation and tipping people into crisis
5638457 the emergency is made worse by the erosion of livelihoods among the landless pastoralists internally displaced persons and the urban poor across the region the poor march may rains have caused food security to deteriorate to high or extreme levels in parts of somalia ethiopia djibouti and kenya
5638458 not acting on this could have very negative consequences that would be embarrassing for governments so the un system does have some leverage on states
5638459 poverty is still a problem in this country yet most farmers who own big chunks of land dont utilise it others only use it for subsistence farming while the few who grow for commercial purposes fail to set up other enterprises
5638460 the ministry of finance has already secured the money and very soon it is going to be in our office to allow us start the programme of delivering both seeds and food items to you mr ecweru said
5638461 in kumi district all the seeds supplied by the ministry of agriculture have failed to yield
5638462 our people are starving because all their crops have failed since it is not their making we would request the government to help provide them with food ratios and seeds as they struggle to avert the situation

5638478 this devout man used considerable force upon himself clearly causing injuries and causing others present to fear for his safety to such an extent that they started to intervene and calm him down
5638479 the prosecution say the defendant ignored the advice given to him that this practice was not allowed for children under 16 years of age

5638511 it is not merely of some importance but is of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done
5638512 why should all mankind for one mans fault thus guiltless be condemned

5638516 has had catastrophic effects on the poor and weak of the whole world putting in danger the lives of women and exposing millions of people to the risk of contracting hiv
5638517 policies against aids based mainly on the distribution of condoms have largely failed
5638518 the answer to aids requires deeper and more complex interventions in which the church is active on many fronts
5638519 every condom sold sends the buyer to aquire the aids virus
5638520 lets see theres a divorce rate of around 50 percent social permission for men to experiement in homosexuality along with the womens movement to kill their babies instead of honor gods will for them as mothers and psychopathically frustrated young men murder a dozen fellow students every year or so in the public schools gee i cant see any affect upon healthy marriage and family can you
5638521 this is the first time that a model fits all our empirical data
5638522 these genes work in a sexually antagonistic way that means that when theyre represented in a female they increase fecundity and when theyre represented in a male they decrease fecundity its a trait that benefits one sex at the cost of the other
5638523 sexually antagonistic selection is an old idea by richard livescience
5638524 there are a large quantity of these traits found in insects for example and recently in deer sexually antagonistic traits have been discovered showing that high ranking males produce rather unsuccessful daughters we found that sexually antagonistic selection is operating also in our species and we found it in a very important trait which is homosexuality
5638525 i think its almost beyond a doubt that genes have some influence
5638526 my personal view is that there is probably more than one biological mechanism contributing toward homosexuality i think its also safe to say that there is at least one non genetic influence
5638527 i would like to see the first observation reproduced in a different population and possibly with a larger sample to make sure that this holds up
5638528 if it is replicated thats a very interesting finding its a possible scenario
5638529 were still working on lesbianism but were not getting to the same result and possibly well come out with a completely different explanation
5638530 i think this is an example where the results of scientific research can have important social implications
5638531 you have all this antagonism against homosexuality because they say its against nature because it doesnt lead to reproduction we found out this is not true because homosexuality is just one of the consequences of strategies for making females more fecund
5638532 however if anything were to qualify as a hate crime to us this seems like this might be it
5638533 imagine if they kidnapped somebody and you make a plea for that individual to please return that loved one to the family

5638536 all of the interviews from last night are that he did in fact refuse treatment
5638537 unless we can disprove that charges probably wont be filed in this case
5638538 you just build up so much urea in your bloodstream that it begins to poison your organs and the heart is particularly susceptible
5638539 i also find it hard to argue that first council of nicea that took place some 1700 years ago still can hold relevance in a modern society
5638540 the concept has a detrimental effect by generating a feeling of inferiority in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way that is unlikely to ever be undone
5638541 we discriminate against women because its what we always have done
5638542 none of these instructions are laid out in the bible how is this anything but the interpretation of a scant few that controls the lives of many
5638543 i also find it hard to argue that first council of nicea that took place some 1700 years ago still can hold relevance in a modern society
5638544 you are not reliant and i can do things better then you
5638545 why do the all the world governments say the earth is round
5638546 what about nasa dont they have photos to prove that the earth is round
5638547 why has no one taken a photo of the earth that proves it is flat
5638548 how did nasa create these images with the computer technology available at the time
5638549 why god heals some reptiles amputee tails and not any human amputees is god a reptile lover what does it take for him to be a human lover
5638550 i guess maybe i just offended 14 per cent of the people who are listening to this message
5638551 well if that is the case then i say thats tough this is america folks its called free speech and none of us at amp sons ford are afraid to speak up
5638552 amp sons ford on sierra highway in mojave and rosamond if we dont see you today by the grace of god well be here tomorrow
5638553 quite possibly the most offensive advertisement for an automobile dealership that i have ever heard
5638554 i really dont care about what his the owner of the dealerships opinion of us godless folks is but the most offensive part of the ad is the shut up and sit down part
5638555 i guess he doesnt support first amendment rights for those who dont agree with him
5638556 51 percent of people in this country are white why cant we tell the other 49 percent to sit down and shut up
5638557 god is the only one we can turn to at this point
5638558 our leaders dont seem to be able to do anything about it the prices keep soaring and soaring
5638559 one pair of hands at work can accomplish more than a million clasped in prayer
5638560 all those lamps burning oil its going to destroy the world and cause the whole earth to overheat
5638561 before god to cover my daughter as her authority and protection in the area of purity
5638562 it inspires me to be spiritual and moral in turn if im holding them to such high standards you can be sure i wont be cheating on their mother
5638563 they are desperately waiting for us in a culture that lures them into the murky waters of exploitation they need to be rescued by you their dad
5638564 the culture says youre free to sleep with as many people as you want to
5638565 something i need from dad is affirmation being told im beautiful
5638566 if we dont get it from home we will go out to the culture and get it from them
5638567 i promise to god and myself and my family that i will stay pure in my thoughts and actions until i marry
5638568 ive heard from fathers that this challenged them to guard their own eyes for example
5638569 it is a call to covenant which basically says i as my daughters father will be a man of integrity and purity
5638570 the villagers are complaining that the suspected wizards and witches are making the bright children in the community dumb these suspected witches are not doing good things to us
5638571 reduced to something so small you cannot tell which is the leg and which is the arm
5638572 how can they the young men prove that a person is a wizard it is likely that the people who committed these killings had personal vendettas against their victims
5638573 these people identified who is to be killed by accusing their victims of bewitching their sons and daughters
5638574 its one of the very last patriarchal hierarchies in the western world and i dont know when they will be ready to let go of that
5638575 this is bringing more and more women into our group and i think were getting more support from catholics who are saying this is getting ridiculous
5638576 the eucharist is the source and summit of our life in the church and is crucial to our approach to god does not a male only priesthood distort our view of god and the church
5638577 the woman is actually a siren not a mermaid which in greek mythology lures people to them with their beautiful songs and then kills them
5638578 the starbucks logo has a naked woman on it with her legs spread like a prostitute
5638579 need i say more its extremely poor taste and the company might as well call themselves slutbucks

5638607 we are confident in searidge as a partner and its technology and are actively pursuing other opportunities in the region
5638608 i was surprised and a little disappointed i thought that big businesses in the united states were by and large recognizing domestic partnerships like this for health care benefits
5638609 since their blue cross blue shield of alabama policy offers art benefits it is extremely troubling that honda has chosen to solely and specifically exclude same sex partners from art benefits
5638610 benefits for fertility treatment and art are limited to a lifetime maximum payment of 30 000 00
5638611 effective january 1 2008 honda manufacturing of alabama requests that blue cross and blue shield exclude domestic partners same sex partners from art benefits including diagnostic services related to fertility infertility that have a fertility or infertility diagnosis
5638612 i do have some personal experience providing infertility services for such patients i have found them to be very good patients and excellent parents i have watched these children grow up over the years and they are healthy and happy in every way they are no different than any other children
5638613 it is disappointing to see a company of this caliber and size discriminating against a certain population of patients
5638614 for one of the worlds leading automakers to discriminate and deny medical coverage for a disease based on someones personal orientation is downright appalling

5638625 i am not questioning the need but i am questioning the procedure in which its done
5638626 by instituting this three year cutback this would allow external agencies a period of time to secure any offsetting funding nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations in our opinion and i say our meaning myself a bunch of people ive spoken to should not be under the umbrella of lcg their tax dollars should not be given to these agencies
5638627 some of these have to be taken by their own merit and largely because of what service they provide
5638628 just to make the determination across the board may be convenient but not necessarily the best way
5638629 all the discussion tonight is real emotional and its all feel good but i believe what mr theriot is trying to say is also extremely accurate we cant just say yes to everything without having some consequences eventually i would like for you guys to consider putting this up and letting them the voters tell us
5638630 many agencies have are and will continue to make a difference
5638631 if you start cutting things then you begin to take away services every single one of them could express their value and their worth to the community people assign a value to things that are worth something to them
5638632 thats a lot of money for drugs ill tell you
5638633 what is occurring now is the inmates are unfortunately placing things in the toilets that shouldnt be in there blankets batteries cups pretty much anything they can get their hands on
5638634 in several instances thats resulted in the jail backing up
5638635 after dr savoie started i made these and have passed them out around offices on campus

5638637 turning to the colleges to help with fundraising is a good idea
5638638 the colleges can really connect with alumni and develop more specific relationships with the community
5638639 this is a good time to capitalize on that excitement and get people excited about ul
5638640 many members of our community have graduated from lsu and theyre going to have a loyalty to the school they graduated from
5638641 we wont change that but we can do more to let our community know who we are and why were integral to the community
5638642 there are a lot of positive things about ul that fly under the radar
5638643 we need to do what we can to get the word out
5638644 the communitys connection to the university isnt only important for fundraising
5638645 its also important in defining who you are in a community

5638738 the huge number of people now working for the eu reflects its huge influence the difficulty of finding out how many officials are working there reflects the eus wider problem with a lack of transparency it is a complicated and opaque institution which leaves it wide open to influence from lobbyists and vested interests

5638781 overall the environment for equity markets remains very difficult as it has now become clearer that we are witnessing a more severe economic slowdown
5638782 the strength in the dollar index has little to do with dollar strength but more the weakness of the other currencies
5638783 the markets focus is just very one sided at the moment the market has decided to focus on the weakness of the euro zone and hasnt taken a balanced view of risks in the u s
5638784 a good education is very important because it will help them have better future
5638785 vietnamese children are suffering from an overload of education and their study from pre school level to higher education level is focusing more on theory than practice
5638786 professionals want their kids to become doctors and engineers i also want my children to have a better life a good education can help them to do this
5638787 in my generation few 5 year old children knew how to read or do basic arithmetic
5638788 overloads can cause psychological burdens on children such as anorexia and insomnia and mental disorders which can lead to depression and even suicide
5638789 we should have balance between childrens study play and social exchanges

5638796 locarno has an excellent reputation in the tourist and cultural fields
5638797 and we are proud that a swiss airbus a320 will now carry its name to all of europes major airports
5638798 with its piazza grande and lake maggiore locarno offers the perfect setting for one of the worlds most important film festivals
5638799 good transport links are vital to our being able to stage such an event and a good number of our guests from all over the world come to switzerland by air from now on they may even get here on the locarno

5638803 you can create conditions so that those who use terror as a tool are less acceptable in parts of the world
5638804 is a method a tool a weapon used against us
5638805 police and intelligence agencies rather than the military should be the tip of the spear against al qaida in most of the world
5638806 the term we use to describe our strategy toward terrorists is important because it affects what kinds of forces you use
5638807 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
5638808 in most instances military force is too blunt an instrument to be successful against terrorist groups
5638809 it can be useful for quelling insurgencies in which the terrorist groups are large well armed and well organized
5638810 we are under pressure to behave like a coherent nation but the truth is those issues remain very much unresolved
5638811 what we need to come up with is a system whereby land is used as a means of production it should not be used for speculative purposes its only that way that we will develop this country

5638814 the image of clogged arteries presents a useful corollary to jesus well known parable in todays gospel it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of god on the one hand a rich person may too easily be tempted to cling stubbornly to his her material possessions and as a result not be slim enough to pass through the tiny aperture that leads into the kingdom
5638815 hemos recibido el visto bueno de naci n de lo contrario no hubi semos avanzado en las negociaciones y se trata de una empresa de origen chino del estado de shaanxi y en esto la provincia no ha hecho m s que expresar la decisi n de que haya inversiones en nuestra provincia que le den valor agregado a los recursos naturales particularmente al gas
5638816 una decisi n que implique la extracci n de gas para producir metanol no es una decisi n que se pueda resolver en tierra del fuego
5638817 han sido consultados con la secretar a de energ a y el ministerio de planificaci n federal que le ha dado prioridad al interconectado porque liberar a parte de los recursos que el estado nacional ten a previsto para hacer el interconectado con el continente
5638818 as que m s all de lo que se diga lo que est claro es que el gobierno de la provincia a trav s de sus funcionarios y en mi caso personal hemos hecho las consultas pertinentes respetando las incumbencias y las responsabilidades que cada uno de los estados tenemos en virtud de la ley de hidrocarburos
5638819 la provincia es la autoridad de aplicaci n pero la que dise a las estrategias y las pol ticas energ ticas es el estado nacional
5638820 por lo tanto y no desconociendo esto estas fueron las consultas que hemos hecho y hemos recibido el visto bueno de naci n de lo contrario no hubi semos avanzado en las negociaciones
5638821 esperamos que la tranquilidad sea de aqu a fin de a o y no que solo se resuma en un acuerdo salarial y permanezcamos con un conflicto por una reivindicaci n de cuestiones laborales que son los d as ca dos
5638822 porque no hay aulas disponibles en la mayor a de los establecimientos
5638823 las simulaciones se hicieron por todos los gastos que se llevan adelante en las planillas de liquidaci n del ministerio ellos dicen que solo se afectar n a los docentes que estuvieron dentro del ministerio de educaci n
5638824 siempre y cuando ese dinero se vuelque en educaci n y que no signifique que el ministerio pueda ahorrar
5638825 no queremos seguir dilatando esta situaci n porque obviamente si se dilata corremos en riesgo de que la tranquilidad no sea tranquilidad queremos llevar tranquilidad a nuestros compa eros y a la poblaci n en general

5638856 door de complexiteit van erp suites zijn saas oplossingen voor administratieve en operationele functies slechts beperkt tot n domein zoals verkoopautomatisering of tot slechts n bedrijfsproces zoals payrolling
5638857 uitgezonderd het gebruik van two tier erp zouden grote organisaties dit aanbod moeten negeren
5638858 veel van de voorspelde groei komt van saas voor personeelsmanagement en financi le oplossingen
5638859 de groeicijfers voor saas erp pakketten omvatten slechts een klein deel van de markt omdat volwassen robuuste oplossingen niet eerder dan 2011 zullen verschijnen

5638863 zullen waarschijnlijk significant zijn en vallen mogelijk niet voordelig uit ten opzichte van vooraf betaalde oplossingen
5638864 de architectuur die nodig is voor saas erp resulteert in hoge interne inspanningen en kosten voor de initi le set up het voortdurende onderhoud en het upgraden van het systeem
5638865 vooral met betrekking tot financi le data en privacy kwesties
5638866 organisaties die invoering overwegen van saas erp moeten van de leveranciers het bewijs krijgen dat hun veiligheids en privacy zorgen niet geraakt worden door superlage kosten proof of concept pogingen en aantrekkelijke beprijzingen voor early adopters die worden aangespoord om hun succesverhalen te delen
5638867 saas erp zal verder groeien vooral op het administratieve niveau
5638868 maar de complexiteit van ge ntegreerde erp pakketten samen met een gebrek aan geloofwaardig belang van de leverancier in dit segment betekent dat echt ge ntegreerde oplossingen zoals saas erp suites voor grote ondernemingen naar alle waarschijnlijkheid niet in de nabije toekomst beschikbaar zullen komen

5638902 in athens we had 3 500 tests and 26 positives the figure of 30 to 40 is an extrapolation

5638947 well a bit of it just my part of it my flat
5638948 japanese flats have same coffee table and bookshelves sofa not so nice as in japan
5638949 how did you manage to come out of the television
5638950 princess realise where telly is and put hands out of screen you do rest
5638951 okay wrong question how did you get in the television in the first place
5638952 princess doing film as usual from the spirit box behind screen film going on as normal with princess having all usual adventures riding wolves and so on and all the while princess glancing out of screen into room to see if interesting it was so princess decide want to leave film and come out
5638953 sorry ad break princess not supposed to be outside telly during ad break gets very confusing with all sorts of spirits trying to get on screen but cannot when princess crossed over okay where was oh so programme start telly spirits start moving around background come on and you see what you see then all stop when ad break come and other spirits come on with new background and so you get what princess mean
5638954 no two reasons first original spirit only go to one telly at a time when spirit master send out for programme and that always telly that on first when programme about to start so princess only here on rest of tellies only copy of princess not original second not all spirits able to leave telly princess special only princess can leave telly
5638955 yes i think so have you come out of other televisions then
5638956 of course as soon as princess know telly can be left princess try first was in japan my country that where princess made you know
5638957 tried it several times coming out of telly that is met people in japan but then princess bored want to meet other people when channel four do season of hayao miyazaki films princess get sent to london and here princess is standing on your coffee table you like london
5638958 yes well its okay a bit busy i am not from here i come from another part of britain up north i have only been here a couple of years so i am still getting used to it how did you learn english
5638959 princess learn from ad break spirits listen when they are performing bang and the dirt is gone
5638960 no im sorry i wasnt laughing at you it just seems an unusual way to learn english
5638961 not really i am afraid i was hoping i would as i really like animation but it is not really my sort of thing
5638962 princess think not appreciated by many people outside japan to be honest princess a little bored by it now done it many times and channel 4 going to keep showing it over next few weeks so princess got to keep being sent to tellies by spirit master
5638963 you see how they glowing means princess have to go back inside telly princess getting weak
5638964 oh i am sorry i was enjoying you being here
5638965 hey princess have idea next time film showed you bring around friends and we have japanese tea party
5638966 princess mean you go buy japanese tea set some tea and bring around your friends then when film start princess reach out and you can pull me on to table princess want to meet proper london people
5638967 next time film on we do tea party now please put princess back in telly
5638968 l lads ive got an err idea why dont we finish off these pints and then come back to my flat we could have a drink and a chat
5638969 i feel like getting out of the noise it would be good to just sit around and have a chat in comfort maybe we could err watch a film
5638970 true but we are going to have to go outside at some point
5638971 my flat could be a stop off that way you dont have to get too cold on one long journey
5638972 it could be a plan i quite fancy getting away from the same old same old
5638973 what do you think lads it would make a change from the usual routine
5638974 i read about japanese tea ceremonies and thought i might give it a go you know
5638975 no not really i dont think living on your own is doing you any good my friend
5638976 actually i have heard there is a really good japanese film on this channel maybe we could check it out for a bit and see if we like it
5638977 our plan is to sit up and be ready because were going to protect our own
5638978 my home is where i get my peace we will get involved if more people did what we do it would be a lot safer

5638988 frequent temperature changes uv radiation and permanent atmospheric moisture start to affect wooden ties after a relatively short time repairing the track involves not only a considerable amount of material organization and personnel it also involves heavy internal and external costs
5638989 this means considerably longer maintenance cycles and associated cost benefits for the railroad operator
5638990 the polyurethane material looks like wood and combines all the positive properties of the natural product with those of a modern composite product the polyurethane ties can be sawn milled screwed nailed and bonded with the same tools that are used for timber processing and even more durably than wood
5638991 compared with concrete the polyurethane material weighs much less and above all boasts the reproducible evenness that is particularly important with turnouts
5638992 with a lifetime estimated to be more than three times that of a conventional track construction these turnout systems and railroad ties are also of interest for operators who are not part of the german federal railways system because of their light weight the ties are also very suitable for bridges
5638993 ive competed at le mans 15 times but this is the closest race ive ever experienced thats exactly how i thought it would be from the start of the year and of course it makes our second win here even more satisfying the finish was particularly tense we really didnt know how it was going to work out up until the very last lap ive never driven a race where ive had to push so hard from the very start to the very end i think its been a great show for everyone
5638994 it was actually a perfect event for us but there were some stressful moments when i got the message in the middle of the night that the corvette was right behind me i was a bit worried at first but then i realised that we had the pace to pull away so from then on it was a bit easier mechanically the car has been perfect very quick and very easy to drive
5638995 lots of people say that winning is easier the second time round but im not sure thats true
5638996 every victory is tough but this one was something else the fact that we managed to achieve it against such strong opposition is a huge tribute to the entire team conditions were far from easy but thanks to a great car and a great team we were able to do it
5638997 for me le mans is the greatest motor race in the world and to win it for the second consecutive year is a brilliant endorsement of a fantastic team effort particularly in the iconic colours of gulf
5638998 after the midwest flooding iowa needed a mobile hospital unit

5639012 and if that requires segregation well then we have got to segregate the child in the best interests of that child
5639013 the problem in applying stereotype threat to uk medical students is that the majority of ethnic minority medical students here are from south asian backgrounds and it is not fully clear whether negative stereotypes exist about that group
5639014 the aim of the study was to establish if negative stereotypes about that group do exist and thus if stereotype threat might be one reason that uk ethnic minority medical students are underperforming academically
5639015 the fact that these negative stereotypes exist raises the possibility that stereotype threat may be occurring
5639016 students also reported being unable to learn from unenthusiastic or intimidating teachers suggesting that negative stereotyping might adversely affect asian medical students learning by interfering with their educational relationships with teachers
5639017 they give me the plane ticket you will go to boise idaho

5639020 what i like about america is that the people are friendly and always helping each other
5639021 it is more than just a dream it is a miracle
5639022 we have opportunities for people were in a growth mode as a city
5639023 the west has kind of a feeling of independence you live in your yard and ill live in my yard and when we need to work together on something we will otherwise well just kind of do our own business
5639024 its just really not ethnically charged or polarized in any way
5639025 this is not your home you have to leave kkk
5639026 people are people and there are feelings that go all across the board
5639027 i dont think it would be unique to idaho or to boise i think there are mixed feelings everywhere
5639028 i think its kind of wrong because theyre taking over american citizens jobs
5639029 thats what the united states is about were all a bunch of refugees
5639030 i think they need kind of a safe haven a place they need to get away
5639031 its also diversifying our community which i think is a good thing as well and its good for our families to reach out and help them
5639032 we are basically their parents when they come to boise
5639033 we meet them at the airport we take them to an apartment that weve already furnished with donated furniture and food
5639034 to them every piece of mail is very special and was sent directly to them and so we spend a lot of time going through advertisements and credit card applications to say you dont need this
5639035 first i put myself in their place and to be uprooted and taken to a country where i didnt even have the vestiges of language and be expected to survive i would have to rely very heavily on friendly faces and helping hands in that country and thats exactly what our role is is to be the helping hands of christ

5639042 we are under pressure to behave like a coherent nation but the truth is those issues remain very much unresolved
5639043 what we need to come up with is a system whereby land is used as a means of production it should not be used for speculative purposes its only that way that we will develop this country
5639044 they just want us to unite but how can we be reunited when they are divided over 2012
5639045 my family perished from an election related incident but people were elected on that account have never come back and said this happened because of us
5639046 it gained 9 035 045 5 percentage points from the may rate of 2 233 713 4
5639047 our inflation figures are way above that but what it tells us is that the productive base of the economy has really shrunk
5639048 we really need to change the way we do business
5639049 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency
5639050 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months
5639051 the calf has spent the last day or so in pittwater and we believe it has been nuzzling up to a moored vessel in an attempt to find milk
5639052 the best thing we can do is to shepherd the animal and hope it remains in the ocean
5639053 think about that and then ask yourself if it was really worth all the broken friendships drama anger rage arguments etc that it took to get to this point
5639054 people that get massively sucked into raiding fulfill this need through raid success as a result they often have less of a drive to work on their family friends children spouse job or school so the actually important things in their real life suffer because this crucial need is being satisfied through mmo raiding
5639055 i play games to play the actual game i dont play games to load up a web site and read a step by step strategy for how to defeat a boss sure you dont have to use raid walkthroughs but you have to be masochistic not to raid encounters are generally designed to require an extremely specific set of maneuvers in order to defeat them
5639056 i also hate the way raiding turns people into such a tiny fraction of what their character can and should be most characters end up using 2 or 3 abilities 90 of the time and in the same exact order over and over again that gets incredibly boring
5639057 it was something like all of our mages and warlocks had the tier 4 something so we had to make sure if we did a certain boss we had a hunter along otherwise if that token dropped it would be wasted having your roster decisions affected in this way is just stupid design
5639058 the reality is that each member of that 5 man group probably worked a lot harder put in more effort and used a lot more skill than a single member of that 25 man raid group in that 4 hour raid at least 20 of those 25 people probably only paid full attention for maybe 30 60 minutes of that entire 4 hours in the 5 man group all 5 had to pay attention for pretty much the whole time
5639059 then one of our guild members switched his priest to a shadow priest ran a few 5 mans to gear up and we rolled over the curator with ease adding this one class aka mana battery completely transformed everything we had read that a shadow priest was virtually required to win but had foolishly tried to do it without one since we didnt have one the utter inflexibility of the boss encounter made it so you pretty much had to forget about success if you didnt bring this one specific class lame
5639060 wow raiding however has taken a horrible turn it is the only form of end game content it requires tons of preparatory farming it requires tons of trash killing and the raid encounters themselves have far too much randomness arbitrariness too many random power immunities etc

5639093 victoria police proposes snr const moores experience and that of mr vorchheimer and his family be incorporated into training utilised in developing and training its people deputy commissioner simon overland said
5639094 such conduct can only be described as disgraceful and should not be tolerated in our community against anyone mr overland said
5639095 victoria police is of the view that snr const moore made an error of judgment and did not act in a positive manner to intervene at the earliest opportunity
5639096 looking at the bigger picture we believe the outcome supports our endeavours for the betterment of the community mr vorchheimer said

5639101 tornadoes are likely in some areas tonight monday and tomorrow and maybe even into the next few days
5639102 even though this storm doesnt look like its very dangerous and people will say its just a tropical storm or its just a category one hurricane our experience with florida tells us that if were not careful we will lose people

5639114 the first 3 skypephone was about building one of the most popular internet services skype into the heart of the device the 3 skypephone s2 builds on this approach and brings a host of other popular internet services to the front of the device
5639115 using the internet on your phone has sometimes been fiddly or complicated because of the limitations of traditional interfaces with the 3 skypephone s2 weve taken our long experience of putting the web onto mobiles and have used it to create a new concept in user interfaces the switcher key gives you instant and intuitive access to all of the core services on the phones menu carousel from every screen making the mobile internet an easy to use reality

5639123 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5639124 my ps vicent rubarema is hiding in technicalities to frustrate government that is a dangerous position
5639125 we are faced with a collapsing fisheries sector on our hands and i am not going to have incompetent managers on flimsy excuses and technicalities appointed
5639126 they have hijacked the political leaderships role and no longer want to take orders from the leadership
5639127 all the mess of having a multitude of agencies masquerading as fisheries managers was brought about by errant technical directives
5639128 my efforts are also being frustrated by the ministry of agriculture and the public service commission on technicalities
5639129 the people they are about to recruit are the ones that have been failing me we need fresh recruits willing to work
5639130 the department needs a complete overhaul and review of the recruitment exercise we need to reverse the collapse of the fisheries department
5639131 very determined to get people who are up to the job all detractors are warned
5639132 we were put as stewards and the work we are doing is not ours
5639133 it is important to protect the forest so that the children who are not yet born can benefit from them
5639134 it is difficult to imagine that the people who have cut down this forest like this expect to get rain
5639135 where five patrol officers are needed to watch over illegal activities you find only one
5639136 we lack manpower but the community in some areas is on our side
5639137 we patrol the forest together and plant trees to help the forest recover
5639138 where we have been central buganda people have depleted the forest
5639139 the once natural beautiful forests are full of cripplers or climbing plants embowabowa
5639140 what we have are paper forest reserves because in some places there is totally nothing on the ground
5639141 there is a lot we are losing because we are replacing indigenous trees with exotic ones
5639142 it is important to recognise that forests are not only about trees
5639143 grassland forests should be planted with pine trees but natural forests should have native trees
5639144 the districts are hungry for revenue from trees and charcoal burning
5639145 this is one of the main sources of income for the local people and the districts
5639146 this has created a vacuum politicians are enjoying it and by the time we wake up it will be a crisis

5639154 over the past 10 years the western pacific region encountered 127 major disasters from natural hazards or 23 of all disasters worldwide
5639155 preparedness and response can be reinforced so that human suffering is prevented or minimized
5639156 this can only be achieved by structures that will not collapse in disasters with an organized contingency plan and with a trained health workforce to continue and provide its services during critical situations
5639157 the recent decline in the oil price and the depreciation of the euro versus the u s dollar have mitigated the concerns about the economic situation in germany
5639158 the financial market experts have for good reason not been impressed by the negative gross domestic product growth rate in the second quarter of 2008 overall they reckon with a weaker but all in all robust economic development and rightly do not fear a recession

5639166 but hopefully if i keep on working hard then i will get that chance i thrive on scoring and if he doesnt put you in the squad then you have to go out and prove him wrong and i think i did that

5639172 i have been living in weymouth for the last two years where the sailing will take place in 2012 so i have two years on the rest of the competition it would be great to replicate this is another four years time
5639173 going in to the race the only thing i had to do was not finish last and the swedish guy also had to win i kept him behind me the whole race so it was a little of a bit of an anti climax going out to not lose rather than to try to win it
5639174 luckily its not a recurrence of his foot injury but he will miss the next two games at least which is a blow for him and the team
5639175 hes already missed most of pre season and could have done without this latest setback

5639183 they have cleaned the bin and placed a mattress in it
5639184 the bin was always neat and tidy and the bed is usually made perfectly
5639185 at first we thought the kids were just playing in the bin but they are there during the day
5639186 theres been a suggestion that theyve been in the vicinity on and off for a couple of weeks but certainly no ones been seen sleeping in the bin or actually living in it maitland police inspector trevor shiels said
5639187 when police investigated they found a few bedding items and living items its a bit hard to draw a conclusion

5639191 kenapa nak kamu malu dan merasa jijik melihat tangan ibu ya
5639192 nak ibu akan menceritakan bagaimana tangan ibu bisa menjadi seperti ini
5639193 nak pada waktu itu keluarga kita hidup dibawah garis kemiskinan yang parah ketika itu ayah kamu hanya lah seorang buruh bangunan kemudian ibu pun hanya bekerja sebagai tukang cuci pakaian anak2 kos di dekat rumah kita yang lama pada waktu itu kamu masih kecil sekali dan terjadilah peristiwa yang menkutkan itu pada waktu itu ibu sedang mencuci pakaian ketika itu orang2 berlarian karena ada kebakaran pada saat itu ibu tidak tahu bahwa rumah yang menjadi tempat kebakaran itu ada di sebelah rumah kita dan ketika ibu tahu kemudian ibu langsung lari menuju rumah kita ibu merasa shock karena kamu masih berada di dalam rumah warga setempat sempat melarang ibu masuk karena api mulai membesar tapi karena rasa sayang ibu yang begitu besar pada kamu ibu memberanikan diri untuk segera masuk kedalam rumah saat itu ibu melihat kamu masih berbaring di tempat tidur dan menangis ibu lalu langsung menggendong dan mencari jalan keluar tapi naas karena pada saat itu ada balok kayu yang terbakar rubuh dan mengenai tangan ibu ibu sekuat tenaga untuk mengindarkan api itu dari diri mu biarlah tangan ibu yang menjadi korban asalkan kamu tidak itu lah yang membuat tangan ibu menjadi seperti ini

5639212 we are here today on the streets of atlanta with real georgians who are struggling and need our support
5639213 well senator mccain you should meet robyn james robyn has a masters degree but she lost her job recently and in this economy shes cant find another one
5639214 id also like to introduce you to dan mizrahi his dad passed away and his mother doesnt have health insurance shes making tough choices that she shouldnt have to make choices between groceries and medicines
5639215 finally you could answer a question or two from john nail johns a republican when senator obama was in town john was able to ask him a question but john doesnt have a few thousand dollars at hand so he doesnt have to opportunity to hear from you here in atlanta
5639216 we hope georgia voters get a good look at the way john mccain is running his campaign and see that if they give their vote to mccain they can expect him to have lobbyists like jack abramoff and ralph reed running the show and making the decisions in his administration
5639217 you can tell a lot about a person by the company they keep today georgians are getting a good look at john mccain and we hope they will remember the company he keeps when they vote on nov 4

5639219 does the mexican federal government spend any funds from the public treasury national budget to maintain or provide the current gas prices
5639220 rebecca is 28 shes old enough to make decisions to do things like that
5639221 she has had other offers that she turned down she did talk to me about it and it was tastefully done and they air brushed out the underwear that she had on
5639222 when we came into these games i thought that maybe we would have four victories from the seven preliminaries
5639223 but unexpectedly i think we are fortunate because since we beat the u s in a very tough first game the good luck has stayed with us and we have won all our games
5639224 before we came to these olympic games people were talking that the u s cuba and japan are very strong
5639225 but no matter whether a team is strong or weak there are many factors that can affect results
5639226 from a marketers point of view you want to have the athletes in the news pages as well as the sports pages so if that can happen for the good reasons the right reasons thats great
5639227 stephanies got a sensational body all those swimmers have got bodies because they train so hard
5639228 so theyre fit theyre healthy theres nothing wrong at all with doing a spread in fhm
5639229 shes on the front cover of new idea and womens day this week so shes hot
5639230 when was the last time we saw a local swimmer whos not getting married on the front cover of a magazine you just dont see it
5639231 stephanies like a bullet from nowhere as far as the publics concerned
5639232 weve know about her for eight years so shes not suddenly a new star on the block
5639233 shell probably still earn a quarter of a million dollars a year or more but all the money those rivers of cash will go to stephanie rice
5639234 he wont earn as much as he could have done if hed won a gold medal
5639235 so not winning a gold medal has probably cost him millions of dollars
5639236 hes not on the scale of say stephanie rice who has three medals or libby trickett theyre much hotter and thats what the marketers will go to where the advertisers will put their money
5639237 sex sells even grant hackett is not as hot as stephanie rice at the moment
5639238 the time for her is now and shell maximise her earning potential by locking in long term deals and shell take them through to 2012
5639239 to succeed here you really do have to believe it will happen and really see yourself being able to do it but the reality is theres a lot of great people out there trying to get the same thing and its not likely to happen
5639240 you dont talk about that ahead of time and because of that some athletes who are great at believing dont really have a plan b and they dont have a gracious response to it because its something they havent prepared for
5639241 still that doesnt explain everything it doesnt explain why swedish wrestler ara abrahamian came unhinged after a loss to eventual gold medalist andrea minguzzi of italy in last weeks greco roman 84 kilogram semifinals
5639242 if i had competed in group a i would have won the gold my competitors were chasing my kilos
5639243 the interesting part is how we deal with these things its going to happen and how do you deal with it the ioc has put down clear rules regarding the medals i think that is a very strong message thats kind of reinforcing what we believe in acting on the best values of sports

5639274 the recent fall in the price of oil and the fall of the euro against the dollar must have dampened economic concerns about the economy
5639275 market experts have not been particularly taken aback by the negative growth rate of the second quarter they expect weaker but all in all solid economic conditions and do not fear a recession

5639291 to ensure appropriate democratic accountability to the people of london
5639292 i have concluded that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor
5639293 does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor
5639294 we have therefore decided to adjust the management structure and abolish that position
5639295 over the last few weeks it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge

5639321 the apple report yes most of the time it just works
5639322 in recent months you have to wonder whether apple is losing its golden touch
5639323 i mean there are rampant reports of dropped call issues with the iphone 3g the rollout of macs successor mobileme was particularly troublesome and add to all this the press has only recent stopped talking about the health of steve jobs
5639324 it is extremely frustrating to be closing my mill through lack of logs while truckloads are going past my door
5639325 the mill is the major employer in town and if all of a sudden 19 families are going to be on reduced income then the flow on to the rest of the community will be disastrous
5639326 it will be the local service station general store and hotel that will feel the pinch as families try and make the most out of limited finances

5639335 wir beginnen gerade mit der produktion der hauptkomponenten f r 2009 etwa chassis und getriebe
5639336 ferrari hat die ressourcen daf r am n chstj hrigen auto zu arbeiten ohne die weiterentwicklung des f2008 f r die laufende weltmeisterschaft schleifen zu lassen die aktuelle saison ist sehr spannend zwischen uns und unseren hauptgegnern es ist aber eine sehr schwierige herausforderung
5639337 wir haben diese herausforderung schon oft gemeistert aber diesmal ist sie schwieriger weil f r n chste saison so viele neue elemente ins spiel kommen ich denke da etwa an die r ckkehr der slicks oder auch die einf hrung des ker systems
5639338 dadurch wird dieses puzzle kniffliger als je zuvor weshalb wir so effizient wie m glich arbeiten m ssen was zeitmanagement entschlossenheit und energie angeht wir befinden uns momentan in einer sehr heiklen phase der entwicklung in der man sich von fehlern nicht mehr einfach so erholen kann ein schritt in die falsche richtung k nnte sich da als enorm kostspielig herausstellen
5639339 wir wollen so viele punkte wie m glich mit nach hause nehmen und werden hoffentlich die ersten sein die ihren namen auf dem siegerpokal eingravieren lassen d rfen
5639340 160 stunden m gen ausreichend und gut sein wenn jemand schon einen entsprechenden erfahrungshintergrund aus einem gesundheits oder sozialberuf mitbringt f r quereinsteiger die als betreuungsassistenten t tig werden wollen braucht es jedoch mehr als einen schnellkurs
5639341 im interesse der patienten aber auch der betreuungsassistenten selbst m ssen die menschen verantwortungsbewusst auf die besonderen herausforderungen des umgangs und der betreuung eines demenzkranken vorbereitet werden alles andere w re grob fahrl ssig
5639342 f r die demenzkranken bedeutet das ein mehr an aufmerksamkeit und zeit die ihnen zus tzlich zur bisherigen pflegezeit gewidmet werden
5639343 auch gegen das bem hen der bundesagentur f r arbeit verst rkt arbeitslose in diesem bereich einzubinden ist berhaupt nichts einzuwenden wenn die bewerber die entsprechende eignung mitbringen und freiwillig zu uns kommen
5639344 an nichtarbeitslose beispielsweise bereits in pflegeheimen anderweitig besch ftigte mitarbeiter die sich f r eine t tigkeit als betreuungsassistent interessieren ist bisher nicht gedacht worden dieser schritt muss nachgeholt werden

5639373 to ensure appropriate democratic accountability to the people of london
5639374 i have concluded that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor
5639375 does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor
5639376 we have therefore decided to adjust the management structure and abolish that position
5639377 over the last few weeks it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge

5639389 the police are investigating the matter but it would seem that the complaints involving pkr members were correct
5639390 you should retract your statement you should not be prejudice and throwing accusations at us you should let the police complete their investigation first
5639391 before i ask my question for this session i would like to say that the deputy minister had made an irresponsible statement and he does not deserve to be sitting in the house
5639392 he told us himself that the investigation is underway how could he say that the assault was from the pkr members im disappointed that he did not retract his statement

5639405 it sells magazines and products does it translate into greater interest and respect in womens sports and the answer is unequivocally it does not
5639406 the assumption is that sex sells the assumption is for womens sports to survive you have to attract the real fans which are male fans and you have to attract them with how pretty they are and how sexy they are

5639412 una gran cantidad de proyectos que no ten an ni siquiera permiso del gobierno de la generalitat pero que han contado con el visto bueno de alcaldes corruptos la costa est superpoblada de este tipo de urbanizaciones

5639423 i couldnt breathe or move my head i never meant to hurt him
5639424 the impression that unmis did nothing while abyei was burned and looted is wrong
5639425 the two sides and their respective armies bore the primary and indeed exclusive responsibility for what happened in abyei
5639426 the fact of that matter is that there was a breakdown of local command and control instructions of high officials were simply ignored by local commanders
5639427 irrespective of the specific numbers of peacekeepers assigned to abyei
5639428 moreover unmis has no such mandate nor do its rules of engagement allow the use of lethal force to protect civilian property
5639429 urgent discussion on incorporating chapter vii use of force provisions in a chapter vi mandate to investigate and mediate disputes and the expectations it generates regarding the capabilities given to the mission
5639430 you cannot have a robust interpretation of a given mandate for which a robust intervention capability is not provided
5639431 nevertheless it does create expectations of an international commitment to provide a broad range of protection and enforcement measures
5639432 three years down the road the prospects for the peace agreement are uncertain but not necessarily bleak
5639433 a successful implementation of the peace agreement brightens the prospects for peace in darfur

5639435 once i injured the ankle in trials i knew what lies in store still instead of backtracking i decided to give it a go after all this is olympics and i have put in a lot of efforts just for this occasion
5639436 but i guess once you injure your take off ankle you really dont have anything to do
5639437 no this is the first time that i hurt it
5639438 if the heart is still beating it means im alive now
5639439 it came at 2 02 pm three quarters of an hour into a speech that kept the nation on tenterhooks president musharraf bowed to the inevitable and announced his resignation here at last was the moment the overwhelming majority of the countrys politicians had been hoping for
5639440 most will wonder why it took the president so long some will rue the lost opportunity to impeach him what is incontestable is that the country must move on from this crisis quickly

5639443 nur wenn der vogel mit einem gelben punkt markiert und der spiegel unverdeckt war begann die elster den punkt zu entfernen
5639444 das zeigt uns dass sie im spiegelbild tats chlich sich selbst erkannt hatten
5639445 der bei menschenaffen und menschen besonders gro entwickelte neokortex wurde lange zeit als unabdingbare voraussetzung f r komplexe denkprozesse angesehen wie alle v gel haben elstern jedoch keinen neokortex sondern weisen eine vollst ndig andere hirnorganisation auf somit zeigen die aktuellen ergebnisse dass sogar selbst erkennen ohne neokortex und somit durch alternative hirnstrukturen erzeugt werden kann
5639446 we were expecting over 2 million people to come to beijing for the games we may find in the end it was less than 600 000
5639447 many many clients did not want to come because of perceptions of china and the tibet issue another issue was all the visa problems and restrictions before the games
5639448 the main problem is that government has thrown so many people out of the city foreigners and chinese alike and its so quiet hotels are feeling the pain
5639449 they made it hard to get tickets and hard to get visas the impression they gave was that they didnt want foreigners to come
5639450 generally speaking regular visitors will avoid the peak period during the olympics games only athletes coaches and fans will visit then
5639451 its lower than we expected its because chinas policy is very restrictive and its not easy to get visas
5639452 ik heb zo mijn twijfels over die verandering bij jou wat in mijn ogen namelijk nog steeds hetzelfde is gebleven is dat je kennelijk nog altijd denkt dat de wereld om jou draait
5639453 wir haben bereits viele verbesserungen an mobileme vorgenommen haben jedoch noch viele weitere vor uns
5639454 there are two major pressures impacting the development of physician scientists
5639455 decreased funding by the national institutes of health has created enormous pressure on young researchers and the marketplace of current medicine with its increased demands to be clinically productive further constrains the time they can devote to research
5639456 we expect these awards to play a significant role in changing the career trajectory of funded researchers encouraging talented young investigators to pursue careers in stem cell research
5639457 im pleased that great research has the opportunity for funding
5639458 we command the system calling all recievers we are noisy people for a better living

5639461 the foundation appreciates these donations since the scholarship program supports our student members who represent the future of our industry
5639462 his personal involvement is crucial to being an effective mayor and to ensure appropriate democratic accountability to the people of london
5639463 london has not lost the services of tim parker he has completed the first stages of the glas restructuring and we will continue to benefit from his advice im also personally grateful to him for his continuing support and friendship
5639464 transport for london is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be take are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge there are limits therefore to what can be delegated
5639465 i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport i have concluded however that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor we have therefore decided to adjust the management structure and abolish that position
5639466 we have a global it infrastructure so email runs this company from shipping to tracking to fulfillment if we lose email the company would shut down and that just cant happen
5639467 the growth in volume of pst files is a huge issue across our network with 10 15 gigabytes of pst files per user management of these files is time consuming and its a huge administrative burden for us we need to centralize the storage to reduce complexity and management costs
5639468 outsourcing became too complex and costly with too many layers so we wanted to bring everything back in house
5639469 mimosa provides dr and exchange backup right out of the box
5639470 this is as efficient as it gets and it will help me sleep better at night knowing that we will have an added layer of protection for the company
5639471 companies like jas worldwide depend on email as the primary business application and they need a unified archiving and data protection solution to ensure business continuity
5639472 nearpoint is the only unified content solution that can manage the discovery retention and protection of information across its lifecycle to limit exposure minimize risk and reduce costs
5639473 based on the recommendation from nwn we looked very hard at netapp as the potential storage provider for burts bees
5639474 the closer we looked the more apparent the fit was sustainability is a very important factor for burts bees all throughout the organization including it since netapp is a storage vendor that is sustainable in its own right and provides a technology that puts the environment first it was the clear choice
5639475 netapp deduplication and flexible volumes gave us unprecedented storage savings for our virtualized environments providing us with exactly what we were looking for
5639476 we anticipate virtualizing all of our physical servers within the next year to help us grow sustainably and that wouldnt be possible with another storage platform and with the ability of netapp snapshot technology to easily mesh with vmware it provides us with peace of mind and a much better recovery point than with some of the other data protection solutions out there
5639477 customers like burts bees that experience tremendous growth year over year need a storage platform that not only addresses their critical storage needs today but also has the ability to scale with their growth
5639478 netapp does just that providing burts bees with a storage solution that addresses its expanding storage and data protection needs but without a constant requirement to add storage expansion and its associated power and cooling requirements netapp allows burts bees to focus on sustainable business and environmental practices
5639479 asigra is addressing the need for effective affordable and easy to manage backup and recovery with its information recovery management platform asigra televaulting
5639480 asigras key differentiation its agentless service oriented architecture soa makes the solution less intrusive and simple to deploy and maintain decreasing management costs for service providers and increasing their profitability
5639481 idc data shows that the amount of digital information that will be created captured and replicated will grow from 161 exabytes eb in 2007 to 988eb in 2010 a six fold increase worldwide archiving software 2008 2012 forecast idc 212216 with so much information being digitized as well as mobilized through laptops and mobile devices companies are trying to define retention policies and retrieval processes to meet management objectives and regulatory requirements worldwide storage services 2008 2012 forecast idc 212063
5639482 with mounting pressure to comply with regulatory requirements and improve disaster recovery practices companies are experiencing dissatisfaction with traditional backup methods that are falling short regarding efficiency reliability and ease of use
5639483 asigra televaulting is delivered to both small and medium enterprises smes and large enterprises through managed service providers including outsourcers and integrators the platform is designed to make it easy and cost effective for customers to achieve regulatory compliance and drive greater benefits from virtualization
5639484 the management and support of most solutions which require agents on customer endpoints can represent additional costs and complexity for the storage service provider furthermore the costs associated with storing increasing amounts of data is concerning if the cost structures become too prohibitive then service providers risk losing their recurring service revenues from these customers
5639485 a simple approach to data backup protection for businesses in industries with regulation and compliance concerns such as legal financial healthcare and oil and gas
5639486 we think the idc study accurately captures the challenges organizations of all sizes and their managed service providers continue to face we believe that the future will see more and more service providers looking to asigra for an affordable flexible solution to meet their customers constantly growing backup and recovery needs
5639487 the genetics policy institutes stem cell action awards presented at the world stem cell summit honor the people and groups who have made the greatest impact in advancing the cause of stem cell research
5639488 gpi is very proud that we can honor these heroes for their effective actions that are lifting awareness and bringing us closer to delivering on the promise of stem cell research
5639489 sorry to inform you but nothing comes between me and my tuner
5639490 well you know it all depends on whether its spelled t u n e r or t u n a
5639491 there is potential that this continuing research will have huge clinical implications
5639492 if we can define the mechanism for recovery the translation of these findings to the clinic will dictate how much massage is needed for how long and when it should be performed after exercise
5639493 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
5639494 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
5639495 its hard to describe exactly how the exercise intensity would be matched in a human but this was considered a significant amount of exercise that would likely cause muscle soreness and possible damage
5639496 we know biological tissues are sensitive to the magnitude of frequency duration and load so we controlled the force frequency and time spent on massage
5639497 one fundamental question is how much of a role does inflammation play in repair to a muscle are we preventing inflammation and therefore improving recovery we havent proven that yet
5639498 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise
5639499 a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage
5639500 ultimately we could also find out how massage helps not just exercise induced muscle injury but swelling and pain associated with other medical conditions as well

5639502 this is a unique project and the unodc is privileged to be working in partnership with the government and all stakeholders in its implementation
5639503 women and vulnerable children are the main beneficiaries they will benefit from improved service delivery particularly at provincial and community levels as a result of increased capacity and the revamped collaboration of the relevant government institutions and civil society organisations
5639504 strengthening civil society organisations particularly those working at community level must always remain one of our strategic objectives as they were the ones who deliver services to the most vulnerable in society
5639505 they understand their issues and are able to listen to their problems the community also trusts them and feel more free to open up
5639506 in simple terms school refusal is absenteeism where children complain of physical symptoms or express fear about going to school
5639507 its different from truancy because these kids generally stay home with their parents knowledge
5639508 the longer a child suffers from school refusal behavior and is allowed to stay home the more difficult it is to return to school
5639509 its important to seek solutions and get them quickly back on the right track
5639510 the combination of brain imaging and genetics research has exciting potential to reveal the genes that are important in the development of brain disorders
5639511 said hilary blumberg md neuroimaging expert and lead author of the study dr blumberg is an associate professor of psychiatry diagnostic radiology at the yale school of medicine and yale child study center as well as director of yales mood disorders research program
5639512 the number of times that a physician will deal with a surrogate decision maker is growing as our population ages and conditions such as alzheimers disease become more common the issue of how physicians interact with surrogates is a very important one we found that physicians often want to take an active role in determining what is right for a patient and often grapple with the needs of the patient versus those of the surrogate
5639513 i always think its important that its not a decision that the family member or the surrogate is making for themselves but it is a decision that they are making for someone else based upon their best knowledge of what that person would want
5639514 when i feel strongly that the patients quality of life is really poor then i do feel that it is appropriate for the physician to try and guide the family member toward a decision
5639515 if the patient cant make the decision then i discuss it with the family i sometimes will push the family to do what i think is best for the patient
5639516 i think family burden is an issue i dont think it should govern what the final decision is but i do think it should be addressed
5639517 we were shocked to find such high rates of hardship among upper income families
5639518 these results suggest that state and federal policies that are in place to help families with disabled children are not going nearly far enough
5639519 they are not eliminating deprivation and these findings are particularly troubling now when the nations economy is struggling families raising children with disabilities are likely to be hardest hit during this economic downturn
5639520 these families struggle to provide adequate care for their disabled children

5639523 the recent fall in the price of oil and the fall of the euro against the dollar must have dampened economic concerns about the economy
5639524 market experts have not been particularly taken aback by the negative growth rate of the second quarter they expect weaker but all in all solid economic conditions and do not fear a recession

5639573 pakistan civilian leaders should now move quickly to challenge the taliban and al qaeda which threaten its own stability
5639574 the first challenge is to choose a new civilian president free from any taint of corruption or complicity with past dictatorships the presidency must also be stripped of the special dictatorial powers that musharraf seized for himself including the power to suspend civil liberties and rule by decree
5639575 american aid can only make a difference if pakistans leaders are finally willing to face up to the countrys problems
5639576 the bonds given to fertiliser companies are quoting at a discount of about 15 per cent so a bond with a face value of rs 100 will fetch only rs 85 this amounts to the government paying only rs 85 against the dues of rs 100
5639577 the companies are asking for delivered costs of fertilisers they have to give cash to raw inputs providers transporters and others moreover when they deposit tax they will have to give it in cash so what they need is cash and not bonds
5639578 the authority is of the view that government intervention in the form of an enactment is not desirable at this stage therefore self regulation through the industry led barc has been recommended with government guidelines covering barcs organisational structure functioning and methodology

5639580 disturbing facts and figures that illustrate the consequences of having no access to sanitation
5639581 but it is worth noting that very many people are still not familiar with the statistics or even aware that there is a global sanitation crisis
5639582 these people use a fancy toilet which is connected to an effective sewer system and they are probably unaware that this toilet and its flushing system are critical to a healthy life
5639583 the year is not over yet but i would like to take a look at what the iys has achieved so far
5639584 if we are to reach the target we now need to provide at least 173 million people per year with access to improved sanitation
5639585 when i visited ethiopia earlier this year i learned that 1 3 million latrines had been built within 18 months in the countrys southern nations province
5639586 unsgab will continue to call a spade a spade or perhaps i should say a toilet a toilet and ladies and gentlemen i hope i can inspire you to do the same
5639587 is the iys 2008 making enough impact on the ground will our activities lead to sustainable improvements
5639588 in other words how many more people are gaining access to improved sanitation facilities how many have already paid a visit to the toilet how many now experience improved sanitation as a basic facility
5639589 six months down the line we can conclude without doubt that unsgabs efforts are bearing fruit we are on the right path and support around the world is increasing but that does not mean we have achieved all our goals in fact we have only just begun

5639593 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
5639594 air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
5639595 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke
5639596 of course the real solution is to reduce air pollution

5639763 since were now moving quickly toward 1 0 it may also help to know which direction were headed to help out weve also prepared a this will be a living document and well keep it up to date as the android landscape evolves currently it covers the next few months roughly through the end of the year and a bit into next year well update it with additional detail as we are able to but even right now it can help give you a picture of how things will play out as the first phones draw near enough of that though youre probably wondering whats actually new in the sdk well you should read the api delta report for all the details but here are a few highlights first and most obviously the new home screen is included along with a ton of ui changes for 1 0 some new applications are included an alarm clock calculator camera music player picture viewer and messaging for sms mms conversations several new development tools were added such as a graphical preview for xml layouts for users of eclipse and a tool for constructing 9 patch images since weve got a new home screen application now we thought the now obsolete version from the m5 early look sdk might be helpful to developers so its source is included as a sample a number of new apis are fleshed out and improved and others are now close to their final forms for 1 0 tons of bugs were fixed of course if you had problems with the mediaplayer try it now there are a lot of changes the ones in the list above are just my personal favorites so you should check out the links above for the full story not all the changes are additions though im sorry to say that we had to remove a few things such as the gtalkservice for security reasons and the bluetooth api theres a bit more detail in the links above and well follow up on those in particular here in this blog to give you the scoop in fact weve got a little list of topics we want to talk about here so stay tuned

5639911 seabrook beach hottie before the big storm m4m 26 mass
5639912 i cant see fitting the middle school program in what the state baseline is without losing some programing
5639913 we must feel confident as a board that the school we are designing will actually fit the program we offer
5639914 i think theres been a number of points of view raised that the cost and the size of the school has to be addressed
5639915 i dont think we could be more specific then weve been already and i suspect if we engage in further discussion we will be more specific
5639916 eminent domain is a very serious issue and i suggest councilors take a long hard look
5639917 the goal is to keep the flavor of the original barn
5639918 if you can ride on a wave on some kind of craft thats surfing

5639921 you make of it what you want to make of it
5639922 even if youre an adult and you read a book it takes you back to when you were younger
5639923 i still remember the first day my grandmother bought me a book it was great
5639924 you talk to a lot of people and they assume that there arent any new comic book collectors
5639925 comics have changed a lot its not just spider man and fantastic four and what you see in the movies right now
5639926 they even write moby dick and last of the mohicans and a lot of classic books
5639927 its a lot like any other kind of collecting in that people are complete ists
5639928 they dont just want issue number 12 and 35 it occupies your time for completing something
5639929 i dont think its the final goal of having them all
5639930 its the trip there once the guys have it all they lose interest and want to sell it
5639931 back in new york it was more adults about 90 percent
5639932 from a store owner perspective you get to talk to a ton of fans and get to talk about what you think can happen
5639933 energy is no longer affordable and the effect is reaching well into the middle class we need to meet with police chiefs and with mayors to talk about setting up shelters people are coming in every day
5639934 it might be down now but i think well see home heating oil prices reach 4 a gallon and higher
5639935 theres a lot of brain power here there are a broad group of stakeholders represented we can work together to find regional solutions
5639936 people 65 and older make up 20 percent of our households
5639937 they make up 35 percent of our low income and the percentage of their energy burden is high at 13 to 15 percent of their income this year with higher electricity prices we need more liheap low income home energy assistance program funding and we need to increase the eligibility rates
5639938 we need to work against shut off moratoriums to prevent deaths
5639939 we represent low income and middle class folks we look forward to working with this group
5639940 you can only chip away one issue at a time
5639941 theyre seeing increases in the cash needed to buy the fuel

5639943 were fairly clear that getting off oil right now is a good idea
5639944 the art of nancy cooper funk nature pets scenes of the kennebunks
5639945 its about what people feel they feel nervous they feel uncomfortable
5639946 the people of this state are grossly overtaxed as it is
5639947 this is obviously not to the advantage of the people
5639948 the woman wanted something for her children to hug while she was in treatment where the face is you slide in a picture of the person you want to remember we put mom and dad in there
5639949 the show normally takes four hours to set up but they did it in two and a half

5639953 ive been playing music as long as ive been surfing
5639954 traditional blues players are players that have been through something
5639955 the older you get the hipper you get as far as being a blues player
5639956 the goal is to keep the flavor of the original barn
5639957 we have seen many pictures and stories about the tibetan buddhist monks over the years we have read about buddhist monks fleeing from tibet to india to escape the chinese cruelty and so now to finally be able to spend a whole week with our visiting tibetan monks is a lifetime experience i am tremendously impressed with their courage and their dedication to human rights and religious freedom
5639958 if you can ride on a wave on some kind of craft thats surfing
5639959 all these enclaves of support are coming together for one purpose
5639960 to give back to these brave americans its going to be fun thats the essence of surfing
5639961 i am so proud of her she worked real hard
5639962 she decided at the last minute to enter so she only practiced her dance routine four or five times she loves to be on stage
5639963 ms valentine is my favorite teacher i have been with her for two years and she is the best
5639964 shannon has never taken tap lessons she taught herself to tap
5639965 i heard them call the first runner up and it took me a minute before i had realized that she had won
5639966 brandi was not even going to enter the pageant this year but changed her mind at the last minute
5639967 is the size i wanted and im from this area im familiar with the area and the people
5639968 based on the licensing definitions for a food service establishment and also the definitions of a meal and restaurant based on new hampshire state statutes it is clearly defined as a restaurant if it sells any food
5639969 so if part of the establishment is selling sandwiches soups and coffee and pastries thats certainly a restaurant with sit in available even if the food is going out the ruling was no restaurant use im not sure what changed
5639970 an eating establishment where food food products or beverages including alcoholic beverages are served and for which a charge is made even if the serving of the meal is not the primary function of the establishment
5639971 i think they should follow the conditions they agreed upon in the beginning
5639972 parallax partners should be required to adhere to the established height restrictions of 35 feet to keep with the scale of existing structures on portsmouth avenue and to minimize the impact of additional traffic on an already congested intersection by reducing the number of feasible rooms by an estimated 40
5639973 its a community event that started off with all volunteers and last year chuck marsden re directed it
5639974 were looking forward to doing lots of programs for middle schoolers of new hampshire this coming year
5639975 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5639976 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5639977 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5639978 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5639979 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5639980 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5639981 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5639982 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5639983 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5639984 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5639985 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5639986 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5639987 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5639988 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5639989 the trees are a part of the landscaping of the home and we are making every effort to preserve that
5639990 during construction you are going to have to move a lot of the soil what happens if we keep getting the wet weather we have been
5639991 we used to show horses together but when she died i completely got out of it
5639992 when linda got diagnosed with cancer it bothered makayla because she knew what i went through
5639993 she has been the one who has been organizing and making calls and doing all the legwork
5639994 lindas youngest daughter is 12 and she and linda have a really close relationship
5639995 i couldnt imagine the possibility of losing my mom at such a young age
5639996 instead of doing a walk a thon people would get sponsored by showing horses
5639997 ribbons for linda collects money from all sorts of different people and places
5639998 we just want to make a difference in their lives and make this easier for them
5639999 were so lucky here on the seacoast that this happens every fall
