580142 la cgpme approuve le discours de v rit du pr sident de la r publique sur la n cessit de remettre travail et emploi au c ur des politiques sociales la strat gie du partage du temps de travail tait une erreur il est bon que cette page se tourne en ce sens les mesures annonc es dassouplissement des 35 heures ouvrent de nouvelles perspectives aux entreprises en particulier en ce qui concerne les heures choisie
580143 le salari qui le souhaite peut dans le cadre pr vu par une convention ou un accord collectif effectuer des heures choisies au del du contingent dheures suppl mentaires applicable dans lentreprise ou dans l tablissement ces heures choisies reposent sur un accord entre le salari et son employeur bien quelles soient effectu es au del du contingent dheures suppl mentaires elles ne sont pas soumises lautorisation de linspecteur du travail et nouvrent pas droit au repos compensateur obligatoire une telle possibilit deffectuer des heures choisies doit tre pr vue et encadr e par une convention ou un accord collectif de branche de groupe dentreprise ou d tablissement cette convention ou cet accord doit en outre pr ciser les conditions dans lesquelles ces heures choisies sont effectu es fixer la majoration de salaire laquelle elles donnent lieu et le cas ch ant les contreparties notamment en termes de repos le taux de la majoration ne peut tre inf rieur au taux applicable pour la r mun ration des heures suppl mentaires dans lentreprise ou dans l tablissement

580146 de m me il convient de souligner que le chef dentreprise doit imp rativement conserver la possibilit de former librement son personnel sous peine de sengager dans une d marche loignant la formation de lentreprise
580147 pourquoi faut il se retenir dembaucher pour viter le pire au cas o les choses tourneraient mal pourquoi rendre le pire ing rable et le faire redouter parce quil serait ing rable pourquoi faudrait il absolument que lun des deux soit en faute lorsquun salari et un chef dentreprise se s parent
580148 trente deux ans apr s linvention en france du divorce par consentement mutuel quelle audace je propose que nous commencions d finir dans le monde du travail une s parabilit lamiable et aux conditions honorables pour les deux parties

580155 he just looked worried depressed anxious way turned into himself
580156 it would be overstating it to say he looked like a guy who was being led to his execution but its not far off
580157 almost everybody believes that he had absolutely nothing to do with amerithrax
580158 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
580159 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone

580161 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
580162 even though its going to be very useful to have better more reliable figures its also disappointing and very sad that we found out that the epidemic has been worse than we thought for the last 17 years
580163 its like shifting from standard view to wide screen high definition television
580164 in fact the separate historical trends analyses suggested the number of new infections was never as low as 40 000
580165 the fact remains that there are far too many people becoming infected in the united states every year therefore these findings should be a wake up call that the epidemic in the united states is far from over
580166 until you engage the department of justice on this issue as part of an overall comprehensive strategy youre going to miss a major source of infection for the african american community that then goes on to infect women and children
580167 we still have people actually in the united states who are on waiting lists to get treatment
580168 if you simply look at the 19 percent reduction in funding due to inflation and the 40 percent increase in incidence in the new estimate it borders on public health malpractice

580195 so many people interpret release as something you do with the throwing arm but in order to get possession of the ball in your throwing hand you have to release it from the glove
580196 we teach the students at my umpires school that if you see a ball is in a injured or fallen players glove tell his teammate to pick the ball out of his glove
580197 reaches a young demographic and its important for some of these people who have been uncritically supportive of sen obama to come face to face with some of his credibility issues and when youre addressing a political candidates credibility ridicule can be very effective
580198 political ad that millions of young people will see is a negative attack on barack obama the republicans strategy is clear kill the hope thats brought millions of new young voters out of the woodwork
580199 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
580200 its going to take a hell of a lot of money

580210 probably leave rates unchanged and give a no bias statement
580211 we expect the ecb to be on hold for at least the next 12 months
580212 to the mounting evidence that the eurozone economic downturn is deepening
580213 the ecb will no longer describe the economic fundamentals as sound
580214 we expect the risk of a much sharper downturn in the labour market to keep the ecb on hold despite the current inflation overshoot
580215 we wouldnt say it very loud but there may be fair chances that julys 4 1 percent may have been the peak in inflation
580216 the eurozone economy is heading toward a stagnation phase bound to last at best a few months
580217 probably state that it is too early to deem as entrenched the recent downward movement in oil prices
580218 money statistics will be a key signal for the rate outlook

580222 everybody has a camera in their telephones when people can record an event taking place that helps us during an investigation its helpful
580223 i think that while its appropriate for the police department to invite video reports of wrong doing both by ordinary people and police officers the new york police department has a long way to go to ensure that police officers who engage in wrongdoing like what was captured in the two video tapes that were recently disclosed are held accountable
580224 when you look at how people use technology embedded systems mobile computing mobile internet devices servers super computing in almost every aspect of technology linux is emerging as the dominant platform
580225 we are seeing this incredibly unique cross pollinization of innovation
580226 weve had a lot of hand wringing around fragmentation in the past
580227 how do you create applications for mobile and embedded linux how do you to go to market with linux systems how are they received by the eco system how do isvs actually make money with apps and how do operators roll out new services and deploy apps to support their business models
580228 there is no single platform that has a single code base that covers as many different kinds of applications and niches as linux does
580229 linux is expanding its presence in other workloads as it continues to hold down key success areas in web and infrastructure roles
580230 it can force people to follow you which means all your twits will be showed in their twitter home page including potentially malicious links
580231 technical details will be added as soon as this vulnerability will be fixed
580232 im working on several ways to abuse twitter as a platform and ill publish my research in this blog when im done
580233 athletes give up in order to get where they are in the olympics the hours of training and sacrifice to make it to that level of competition is amazing to me the song is about that idea how people have to give up the little things in order to achieve their goals in this case the olympic games
580234 theyre both good on the defensive end as well and bring a lot to our table
580235 its interesting in that they bring different facets of the game jimmy is dangerous with one swing of the bat and then reed kind of brings a different factor into the game when hes in the lineup i definitely like the balance in our club
580236 nobodys really hitting the ball out of the park today
580237 we know how this park plays when the wind is blowing in and we did the small things today and i think thats why we won
580238 i just try to find a way to get on every time
580239 if the bunts not there for me then im comfortable swinging the bat i just feel if the other team is giving me something offensively a bunt whether it be the left side or the right side of the field that i have to take advantage of that situation especially when im leading off that inning
580240 it keeps them both fresh and we need to do that
580241 i think jim hendry has the right type of guys in this clubhouse guys that want to play every day
580242 if you didnt want to play every day you shouldnt be here
580243 i think jimmy edmonds has got that same attitude and i have that we prepare ourselves on and every day basis to play if something happens to the other guy i think that preparation has been a direct cause of our success this year
580244 he doesnt back off he gets after it and it shows
580245 even though early in the game he wavers a little bit he just collects himself and digs in and does a heck of a job
580246 you can only get away with that so many times ive done that quite a bit throughout the course of the year and found a way out of it
580247 i told pitching coach larry rothschild boy well be fortunate if we get 6 innings out of him
580248 ill tell you what over the past two years this guy does as good a job as anybody we have here at putting an end to a losing streak
580249 he started out 1 5 and hes what 10 1 since not too shabby
580250 all he cares about is winning the game and thats what you want even when he doesnt have his best stuff hes going to go after hitters
580251 theres been a lot of times this year when he hasnt had his good stuff but i think a lot of good pitchers when they dont have their good stuff they find a way to battle through 6 or 7 innings
580252 another thing good pitchers do is stop potential losing streaks and thats what teddy did today
580253 and its a lot easier when the guys go out there and put 5 runs on the board and pressure on their pitcher
580254 as the starters in general we expect a lot out of each other
580255 the other guys in the rotation are happy we won today but even that being the case we expect more
580256 they want more out of me and that attitude goes around its fun having those kind of expectations out of each other
580257 youve always seen that over the years like with curt schilling and randy johnson in arizona when you have aces on good teams always trying to one up each other
580258 it seems we have four or five guys rolling and trying to compete with each other each day youre going to find something special out of that pitching staff
580259 theyre the reason were here right now theyve been pitching so well especially when we werent hitting
580260 hes committed to throwing the fastball and the slider hes moving the fastball to either side of the plate and the slider has a good bit to it
580261 thats the guy we want to see and there he is
580262 my job is to throw in the seventh and eighth innings thats my real job
580263 but it wont be him its not him it might be okay but it wont be him
580264 i took my profile off of am i wasnt going to tell you dont take it the wrong way
580265 i took mine off too days ago i didnt want you to take it the wrong way either and it was indeed a funny coincidence that we both so delicately and stealthily committed ourselves in the same way at the same time and had indeed decided not to tell each other for fear of misinterpretation
580266 dont take this the wrong way but i want you completely i need you
580267 i am putting myself out there and now i am vulnerable
580268 geogen victoria believes that the generation of base load geothermal power on the three exploration areas in victoria will be able to compete with the burning of dirty la trobe valley lignites even without the need for carbon offsets or an emissions trading scheme
580269 we are planning to drill up to 30 shallow scout holes to determine the areas geothermal gradient that is the level of high grade heat which can be used for the generation of geothermal base load electricity
580270 the location of the scout holes is being finalised but all will be close to high voltage transmission lines connected to the national electricity grid
580271 its an ideal terrain for geothermal energy resources it will be able to provide a large source of energy in the area and encourage the growth of industries that require heat
580272 no civilization can survive the physical destruction of its resource base
580273 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
580274 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
580275 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack

580286 cloud computing is fundamentally about re engineering the worlds computing infrastructure to enable game changing even life changing applications
580287 to ibm cloud computing is much more than the normal evolution of a data center
580288 we consider cloud computing to be the model that can fundamentally change the current it market structure and create paradigm shifts
580289 to spread cloud computing in japan it is very meaningful that ibm has launched the first cloud computing center in japan at this time ns solutions research center will actively use this center and advocate cloud computing
580290 to develop high skilled human resources in the it field it is necessary to create the latest it environment for the education space
580291 kyushu university is very interested in cloud computing technology which can provide an on demand it environment to our students and teachers we have been working with ibm the pioneer of this field kyushu university will continue to take advantage of cloud computing technology more actively
580292 this announcement further demonstrates ibms commitment to our state and to our people
580293 i look forward to maintaining this partnership with ibm for years to come

580299 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did

580302 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
580303 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
580304 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
580305 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
580306 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
580307 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
580308 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
580309 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
580310 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
580311 marijuana remains a controlled substance and it is illegal under federal law to possess dispense or cultivate marijuana in any form
580312 we might as well have just got robbed by a bunch of thugs downtown
580313 this is an action with the federal government which is sad
580314 because these laws need to be revisited in washington especially the medical marijuana law were incarcerating people by the tens of thousands were destroying peoples lives and people who have a medical marijuana legitimacy are caught in the middle its a problem we need to resolve this conflict is totally unacceptable

580363 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
580364 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
580365 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
580366 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and
580367 and im sure many of us agree wholeheartedly with naomi
580368 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries
580369 you could have a very significant shock to traditional consumption patterns and also some important growth effects
580370 the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today
580371 it would be a mistake a misinterpretation to think that a huge rollback or reversal of fundamental trends is under way
580372 distance and trade costs do matter but we are still in a globalized era

580376 being green is in their best interests not so much in making money as saving money
580377 green companies are likely to be a permanent trend as these vulnerabilities continue but its going to take a long time for all this to settle down
580378 cannot take a risk that the just in time system wont function because the whole global trading system is based on that notion
580379 they are going to have to have redundancies in the supply chain like more warehousing and multiple sources of supply and even production

580383 het is moeilijk om een zekere medaille op te offeren voor een hoger doel maar het programma laat me geen andere keuze
580384 maar ik ben door mijn omgeving overtuigd dat het onhaalbaar is ik ben niet meer die jonge god van sydney 2000 ik ben een dertiger die spaarzaam met zijn krachten moet omgaan
580385 ik besloot op het laatste moment dat ik op de avond voor mijn vertrek naar peking voor mezelf en voor de buitenwacht duidelijkheid wilde hebben het is een verschrikkelijk moeilijke keuze maar nu de kogel door de kerk is geeft dat me veel innerlijke rust mijn liefde voor de 100 vrij is z groot dat ik helaas gedwongen word mijn sportieve ambities aan te passen terwijl ik van mezelf z ker weet dat ik op de 200 vrij een medaille in de wacht sleep buiten phelps hoef ik op die afstand namelijk voor niemand onder te doen nu zwem ik in de aanloop naar mijn enige individuele nummer alleen de 4 x 100 vrij als voorbereiding
580386 wie niet waagt die niet wint of je zoals nu zeven olympische medailles hebt of straks acht dat maakt voor mij geen verschil ik wil alleen nog maar die ene 100 meter winnen je kunt kiezen voor zekerheid door te starten op de 200 vrij met als gevolg dat ik op de 100 vrij minder kans heb op goud of je laat de 200 vrij schieten om nog n keer verschrikkelijk uit te halen en een unieke trilogie te voltooien die keuze is voor mij snel gemaakt daarvoor ben ik te veel sportman
580387 maar dat zegt niet zoveel veel van mijn tegenstanders hebben dit seizoen moeten pieken tijdens olympische kwalificatiewedstrijden de enige wedstrijd waarop k hard wilde zwemmen de ek in eindhoven heb ik wegens ziekte moeten missen
580388 daar heb ik allebei de afstanden gezwommen en daardoor mijn 100 vrij verknald
580389 mijn maximale zuurstofopname de zogeheten vo2max bedraagt 91 zon hoge waarde komt volgens olbrecht maar zelden voor ook uit andere metingen blijkt dat ik er nooit in mijn leven zo sterk voor heb gestaan daarom durf ik met een gerust hart alles op de 100 vrij te zetten

580562 i was actually pleased at the universitys quick reaction at 1 30 in the morning
580563 come on now go on your way and if you wish make a complaint
580564 so we get a number of messages nowadays and these messages can get quite distorted or garbled as they come down the line for example we were told to man the vital points in one such message the message that we received was to man the riffle points that set us guessing for quite some time until the message was repeated once again this time correctly but we had to still find the meaning of vital
580565 we are trying to ensure safety of the trucks on the highway by all possible means and also attempting to keep miscreants away
580566 the policemen were overstretched trying to prevent mobs from setting afire the government buildings and vehicles hence the army had to be called out
580567 if i didnt believe that already it was confirmed when he said he would not be able to meet us at the train station because he was doing a same sex blessing in the cathedral at the time of our arrival dorothy i guess were not in kansas anymore
580568 i was also asked by several people whether or not my own witness and that of other gay lesbian bisexual and transgendered people had been
580569 theres no place like full inclusion theres no place like full inclusion
580570 one of the most intrusive aspects of this lambeth conference has been the presence of gay activists integrity usa is the umbrella organization but six gay lesbian organizations have come here run a daily newspaper called the lambeth witness of gay and lesbian christians rented about 1 3 of the spaces in the marketplace and provided speakers for many self select groups for bishops and their wives additionally these folks have sponsored about half of the evening fringe events they use all the advertising and promotional techniques that money can buy they are better funded than any other organization here gene robinson is also here has been for almost a month now he is seen daily walking on the campus and interacting with bishops that will talk with him of course the tec bishops are only too happy to do so and there are a few from a couple of other places that are also always happy to see him like michael ingham from vancouver canada remarkably as the conference continued there is less and less press about gene the gay newspaper keeps him on their front page none other
580571 my second trip to the marketplace was disrupted the first booth on the corner by the door is the integrity booth they are handing out rainbow ribbons and increasingly these are showing up on tec bishops some wives and the gay press when you walk into the marketplace a watcher at that booth akin to a carnival barker starts shouting about your rainbow ribbon if you dont have one you are admonished to come and get one if you are leaving the marketplace and still dont have a rainbow ribbon you are again told to get one dangerous no it is simply annoying
580572 at lunch break for the bishops on thursday there was a gay demonstration on the lawns outside the big blue tent and their closest lunch cafeteria gene was there at the beginning but when they started kissing and acting out he left so did the bishops hurrying their wives away
580573 i find that many of our north american friends blame us and criticise us for bringing in the issues of sexuality and homosexuality but in fact they are the ones who are bringing these issues in here at lambeth you come across many advertisements for events organised by gay and lesbian activists which are sponsored by the north american church if you visit the marketplace at the conference you will notice that almost half the events promoted on the noticeboard promote homosexuality and are sponsored by the north americans and in the end we the people who remain loyal to the original teaching of the anglican communion which we received from the apostles are blamed they say that we talk a lot about sexuality and that we need to talk more about poverty about aids and injustice they are the ones who are bringing sexuality into this conference its not us we want to talk about the heart of the issues which divide us not only sexuality that is just a symptom of a deeper problem

580617 ok look you need a sign heres a great big pig with wings a flying pig something that never happens something that doesnt even exist and yet here it is just for you you can believe him
580618 do we have to keep on killing isnt there another way
580619 can you brief me on himmel what well find there and be expected to do
580620 chances are that that will be enough to straighten things out
580621 just stop there please and run the flag back down the pole
580622 i had a six months survey of societics seven years ago to give me a general idea of the field ive worked with survey teams since then but i have only the vaguest idea of the application of the information we got could you cover the ground again only a bit slower
580623 well im sure you realize that a good survey is half the problem it must be impartial and exact if it is accurately done application of the k factor equations is almost mechanical
580624 youve lost me again everyone always talks about the k factor but no one has ever explained just what it is
580625 its a term borrowed from nucleonics and best understood in that context
580626 however if you have something like heavy water or graphite that will slow down neutrons and an absorber like cadmium you can alter the speed of the reaction
580627 thats the ideal though the impossible to attain in a dynamic system like a reactor all you need is a few more neutrons around giving you a k factor of 1 00000001 and you are headed for trouble each extra neutron produces two and your production rate soars geometrically towards bang on the other hand a k factor of 0 999999999 is just as bad your reaction is spiraling down in the other direction to control a pile you watch your k factor and make constant adjustments
580628 well get to that just as soon as you realize and admit that a minute difference of degree can produce a marked difference of kind you might say that a single impossibly tiny neutron is the difference between an atom bomb and a slowly cooling pile of inert uranium isotopes does that make sense
580629 this is a generalization and you must look at it that way
580630 all the pressures cross relationships hungers needs hatreds desires of people are reflected in their interrelationships one man standing by himself tells us nothing but as soon as he says something passes on information in an altered form or merely expresses an attitude he becomes a reference point he can be marked measured and entered on a graph his actions can be grouped with others and the action of the group measured man and his society then becomes a systems problem that can be fed into a computer weve cut the gordian knot of the and are on our way towards a solution
580631 the obvious why did you do it change sides i mean give up a positive work for this this negative corruption
580632 positive negative war peace those are just words and it took me years to find it out what could be more positive than making something of my life and of this planet at the same time its in my power to do it and ive done it
580633 we have the stars now but we have carried with us our little personal lusts and emotions theres nothing wrong with that i suppose as long as we keep them personal its when we start inflicting them on others the trouble starts well its over now at least this time
580634 i dont know how you managed it but im glad you found me
580635 but criminal stupidity on my part that let you walk into this trap
580636 dont worry about it i knew what i was getting into but i still had to go spring the trap to see if it was a trap
580637 the whole thing is past the patch and polish stage now
580638 no i was before but not any more as long as i thought it was a normal problem i was being outguessed at every turn you must understand the ramifications of societics to a good operator there is no interrelationship that cannot be uncovered hengly would be certain to keep his eyes open for another field check our kind of operation is very easy to spot if you know where and how to look the act of getting information implies contact of some kind that contact can be detected hes had our location marked and has been sitting tight buying time but our time ran out when you showed them we were ready to fight back thats why i destroyed our setup and cut our trail
580639 im sorry i forgot about your being hurt what can i do
580640 i put a field dressing on thatll do answer my question what is there left what can be done now
580641 ill have to kill hengly that will set things right until the team gets here
580642 you told me yourself that a war couldnt be averted by assassination no one individual means that much
580643 you must look at the power struggle between planets as a kind of celestial chess game it has its own rules when i talked about individuals earlier i was talking about pieces on this chessboard what im proposing now is a little more dramatic im going to win the chess game in a slightly more unorthodox way im going to shoot the other chess player
580644 but im no good for it youre right youll have to go but i can help you plan it so you will be able to get to hengly you might even stand a better chance than me because you are so obviously an amateur now listen carefully because we havent much time
580645 once youre clear of this building youll have to get cleaned up
580646 but thats the only thing you should stop for get to hengly while he is still rattled catch him off guard as much as possible then after you finish with him dig yourself in stay hidden at least three days before you try to make any contacts things should have quieted down a bit by then
580647 its the best way as well as being the only way ill be safe enough ive a nice little puncture in me but theres enough medication to see me through
580648 if im going to hole up ill hole up here ill be back to take care of you
580649 lift me up so i can get at this door cant seem to stand too well any more
580650 i was with you as far as the 3ls what are they a private code
580651 not a code abbreviation linear logic language the pitfall of all the old researchers all of them historians sociologists political analysts anthropologists were licked before they started they had to know all about a and b before they could find c facts to them were always hooked up in a series whereas in truth they had to be analyzed as a complex circuit complete with elements like positive and negative feedback and crossover switching with the whole thing being stirred up constantly by continual homeostasis correction its little wonder they did do badly
580652 ill admit that societics has carried the art tremendously far ahead but there were many basics that had already been discovered
580653 if you are postulating a linear progression from the old social sciences forget it
580654 there is the same relationship here that alchemy holds to physics the old boys with their frog guts and awful offal knew a bit about things like distilling and smelting but there was no real order to their knowledge and it was all an unconsidered by product of their single goal the whole nonsense of transmutation
580655 but how do we work this back to the k factor
580656 once youve gotten rid of the 3ls and their false conclusions remember that politics in the old days was all we are angels and they are devils this was literally believed in the history of mankind there has yet to be a war that wasnt backed by the official clergy on each side and each declared that god was on their side which leaves you know who as prime supporter of the enemy this theory is no more valid than the one that a single man can lead a country into war followed by the inference that a well timed assassination can save the peace
580657 of course not all of the old ideas sound good they have a simple minded simplicity that anyone can understand that doesnt make them true kill a war minded dictator and nothing changes the violence orientated society the factors that produced it the military party that represents it none of these are changed the k factor remains the same
580658 theres that word again do i get a definition yet
580659 of course the k factor is one of the many factors that interrelate in a society abstractly it is no more important than the other odd thousand we work with but in practice it is the only one we try to alter
580660 if a society has a positive k factor even a slight one that stays positive then you are going to have a war our planetary operators have two jobs first to gather and interpret data secondly to keep the k factor negative
580661 everything is in the green so far the ship wasnt spotted on the way down now all we have to do is wait for transportation
580662 im finding out now theyre built to take punishment but being dropped twelve feet into mud soup then getting baked by rockets isnt in the original specs
580663 before we left i drew up a list of current magazines and newspapers i would need you can start on these ill have a sampling program planned by the time you get back
580664 a little trouble in the streets mobs and thats an incredible feat of observation
580665 i had the feeling that if i came in here stark naked you wouldnt notice it
580666 get wrapped up in the computation sorry i tend to forget about people
580667 youre right doing the job im supposed to help you not pose for the before picture in home hospital ads anyway how are we doing is there going to be a war certainly seems like one brewing outside ive seen two people lynched who were only suspected of being earthies
580668 remember the analogy of the pile it boils liquid metal and cooks out energy from the infrared right through to hard radiation yet it keeps on generating power at a nice steady rate but your a bomb at zero minus one second looks as harmless as a fallen log its the k factor that counts not surface appearance this planet may look like a dictators dream of glory but as long as were reading in the negative things are fine
580669 cant tell about it yet you never can until the computation is complete theres a temptation to try and guess from the first figures but theyre meaningless like trying to predict the winner of a horse race by looking at the starters lined up at the gate
580670 let them there are few enough pleasures in this life without taking away all delusions
580671 positive bad much worse than it was when we left earth
580672 now its time to stop looking and start doing what do i do
580673 i thought we had settled that you cant stop a war by assassinating the top man
580674 we also settled that something can be done to change the k factor the gun is for my own protection while youre radioing results back to earth and theyre feeling bad about it im going to be doing something now you tell me what that something is
580675 you can well its possible to change one of the peak population curves
580676 you mean get a lot of guys to take jobs in other towns through the commercial agents
580677 fine in the long run but of absolutely no value in an emergency
580678 cant you isolate some recent key events that can be reversed
580679 it wouldnt be a final answer just a delaying action
580680 take this organization out of the equations and you might even knock us negative
580681 doesnt sound like very important who or what are they
580682 proof positive of the law of averages its possible to be dealt a royal flush in a hand of cards but it isnt very common its just as possible for a bunch of simpletons to set up an organization for one purpose and have it turn out to be a supercharged high frequency k factor amplifier thats whats happened with this infernal s p n b a seedy little social club dedicated to jingoists with low i q s with the war scare they have managed to get hold of a few credits they have probably been telling the same inflated stories for years about the discrimination against natives of this fair planet but no one has really cared now they have a chance to get their news releases and faked pix out in quantity just at a time when the public is ripe for their brand of nonsense putting this bunch out of business will be a good days work
580683 if they are this important and throw so much weight it look suspicious if they are suddenly shut up like an obvious move by the enemy
580684 not at all that might be true if for instance you blew up the headquarters of the war party it would certainly be taken as an aggressive move but no one really knows or cares about this society of the half baked native born there might be reaction and interest if attention was drawn to them but if some accident or act of nature were to put them out of business that would be the end of it
580685 i believe in accidents i believe that even in our fireproof age fires still occur buildings still burn down and if a burnt building just happened to be occupied by the s p n b just one tenant of many and their offices and records were destroyed that would be of very little interest to anyone except the fire brigade
580686 im glad were on the same side thats your department and i leave it to you ill just listen for the news flashes meanwhile i have one little errand to take care of
580687 to see hengly the planetary operator here abravanel told me to stay away from him to run an entirely new basic survey well weve done that now and pinpointed some of the trouble areas as well i can stop feeling guilty about poaching another mans territory and let him know whats going on
580688 the last thing in the world we want to do is to be seen near him theres a chance that he well might be compromised
580689 he might also be surrounded ten deep by the secret police did you stop to think about that
580690 societics has been a well kept secret for over two centuries it may still be a secret or bits of it might have leaked out and even if the himmelians know nothing about societics they have certainly heard of espionage they know the un has agents on their world they might think hengly is one of them this is all speculation of course but we do have one fact this society of native boobs we turned up we had no trouble finding them if hengly had reliable field men he should know about them too the only reason he hasnt is because he isnt getting the information which means hes compromised
580691 well do something to help hengly tomorrow but this operation comes first sit tight get some rest and dont open the door for anyone except me
580692 hes the only one left now so you can get some sleep see you early in the morning though
580693 dont talk to me of treachery my little man of peace creeping up with a gun to kill a friend is that peaceful where are the ethos of humanism now you were very fond of them when we were in the university
580694 he wont kill you not at first at least hes the loneliest man in the universe because he has given up one world for another that he hasnt gained yet there will be no one he can confide in hell know you have come to kill him but he wont be able to resist talking to you first particularly if you make it easy for him to defeat you not too easy he must feel he is outthinking you youll have a gun for him to take away but that will be too obvious this small gun will be hidden as well and when he finds that too he should be taken off his guard not much but enough for you to kill him dont wait do it at the first opportunity

580699 a special person doesnt have to be a lover it could even be a friend
580700 they accelerated this as a result of pams death on monday
580701 i believe they are using this as a tactic to apply pressure at a time when he is most vulnerable because of this tragedy that he suffered
580702 16 unanswered complaints going back as far as 36 months
580703 i couldnt get anything close to that at the bank
580704 we certainly dont believe any downgrade would be appropriate mr chaney told abc television
580705 the banks in very strong shape and at an operating level things are going extremely well but thats a matter for us to sit down and talk to the ratings agencies with and to assure them thats the case
580706 i think the fed is going to stand on the sidelines holding at 2 0 percent were getting a very mixed economic picture right now said scott anderson an economist at wells fargo
580707 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members
580708 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are
580709 i told myself when i get to be a man ill live here
580710 im sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
580711 i aint got no matches but i got a long ways to go
580712 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
580713 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
580714 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
580715 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
580716 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
580717 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
580718 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
580719 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
580720 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
580721 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
580722 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
580723 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
580724 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
580725 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
580726 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
580727 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
580728 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
580729 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
580730 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
580731 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
580732 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
580733 is it technology fatigue a colorful way of branding yourself were not sure
580734 but the demand is clear they are our fastest growing item
580735 a nicer way of connecting than plugging someone into your cell
580736 i wanted to get away from the whole status thing at reunions so a business logo didnt feel right
580737 having my own little logo frees me up its a way to be expressive of me outside of whatever job i happen to be doing at the time
580738 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
580739 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
580740 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
580741 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
580742 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
580743 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
580744 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
580745 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
580746 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
580747 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
580748 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
580749 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
580750 vi ska g ra det h r i r tt ordning

580753 we always consider the territory and hardware for titles and i just want to make sure that were neutral about dealing with companies
580754 in north america microsoft is doing very well with its hardware and for that reason its a very important partner for us
580755 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
580756 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
580757 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
580758 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
580759 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
580760 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
580761 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
580762 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
580763 to this day ive never witnessed a club atmosphere in america better than that one
580764 there were no gimmicks no giveaways it was just fans that wanted to see the houston dynamo advance to the final i still get chills talking about it
580765 i remember sitting back and saying to assistant coach john spencer this is incredible you wish there was another word to describe it awesome memorable theres no word that quite does it that for me was the most incredible 30 seconds of witnessing a crowd it was like soccer had definitely arrived
580766 it seems like weve had a lot of important moments in a short period of time
580767 i think the way the guys stuck together that first season was pretty incredible
580768 one thing that did help us was that guys were new here and had no one to hang out with
580769 i replay that one at certain moments of the year
580770 i walked in and was hit by a wave of emotion
580771 as much as people dont like to lose money what they really dont like to lose is their own money
580772 the basic idea is to let economic incentives have a chance
580773 its been very hard to produce successful results through traditional weight loss methods

580785 theres certain people in your life you realise arent exactly the people that you thought they were
580786 its pretty full on for me its quite shocking it has shattered me as a person
580787 they are disrespecting me and degrading my relationship with dean theyve hooked me up with every ex ive ever had or any guy ive talked to since the announcement
580788 with all the hoo ha thats gone on this week between jess and i we cant wait to get back there actually
580789 there has just been so much stress on us that were kind of just looking forward to getting away from it all now
580790 tanas coaching toulon and he was passing through melbourne on his way home
580791 tana was up front with me he said ive spoken sonnys management group and he made sure to keep me in the loop of what was going on
580792 i was certainly aware of his interest in sonny and he was here doing the sly
580793 i made tana aware of what the plans were for sonny not only for the world cup but also our game in new zealand
580794 but who am i to step in and interfere what i can tell you is tana did tell me that he and sonny had been communicating
580795 i havent talked to him since he left australia for france but i know it doesnt look good for me when ive been mentoring the guy and hes pissed off overseas
580796 if sonny hadnt been in a position he was in im not too sure he would have made that move to toulon
580797 had a few other areas in his life been more settled we probably wouldnt be talking today about it
580798 i could sense his frustration with a few things when we talked
580799 it would have been very hard for me to comment or advise him because ive never been in the position he has been in
580800 as a friend those issues are between him and i and thats how they should stay
580801 its not the ideal and i do feel for the bulldogs and the players at the club but unless you know the whole situation its hard to pass judgement
580802 im not saying what he did was the right thing to do but he is a young guy at 22 and we have to look at exactly why he made this decision
580803 i think he was dealing with a lot of issues and i dont think his situation is over
580804 tony is a very good thrower and has been doing a bit of work on it quietly in the background
580805 with all the injuries we have got in that key area hooker we think thats the best option we have got
580806 we were pretty spot on and probably the best thing was that it was because we were under a lot of pressure and there was group of young people involved for those guys to experience that and come through on the other side i think is really good for them
580807 rodney is a lot more comfortable there but you have to try things if you dont try things you dont learn things but he is definitely comfortable at eight especially when richie is there you have got richie getting there first and him getting there second as a forager
580808 you would have to say that south africa are for the fact that they have three home games but we are in charge of our own destiny if we can win the remaining games then we will have a big show

580810 love is like quicksilver in the hand leave the fingers open and it stays clutch it and it darts away
580811 its not so much that were afraid of change or so in love with the old ways but its that place in between that we fear its like being between trapezes its linus when his blanket is in the dryer theres nothing to hold on to
580812 i just didnt leave the house when i was in a fib
580813 its a concern because it can be difficult to pass a needle through
580814 in ganschows case we turned the radio frequency on and the baylis device went right into the left atrium one try very easy
580815 speaking to us at medical conferences many doctors have expressed to us their intention to switch over completely to the nrg needle
580816 i just thought 80 had a better ring to it
580817 in a few years hopefully well look back and think how silly it was the way we were poking needles through like that
580818 im just looking forward to having a normal life where i dont have to pretend to tie my shoes in a store because im getting dizzy and need to put my head down
580819 i dont want the state to take a role in telling us what to do
580820 my job in district 214 is try to do the best i can for this community
580821 the people here like what the schools provide and we cant endanger that
580822 if this is the land of opportunity then we as a state and as a society have an obligation to create those opportunities for everyone as best we can
580823 would a different kind of tax be as reliable i think its still pretty unclear
580824 but at the same time we never have enough i would like to see schools all over the state funded better but im not sure at this point how wed go about it
580825 i think there would be a way to make it work without hurting the kids out here in the suburbs but wed have to put aside politics to get there
580826 as a statewide system were only as strong as our weakest link
580827 if were failing to educate children somewhere whether its st charles or chicago or anywhere in the state and we have to remediate them down the line in the prison system or elsewhere thats not a good way of doing things
580828 i just said to my team now we take control and i just cruised to the finish
580829 we bike around because we dont want to pay for gas
580830 road racing is a little more exciting since theres a broader field

580843 that coming from such a respected coach helped me a lot it was a great motivating factor
580844 kevin loves his sons but he didnt aim for sole custody he wanted to be a co parent and didnt expect britney not to fight for custody
580845 it is what it is i dont know how to explain that i am who i am i love where i am at
580846 i dont know i just dont pay attention to it i guess i dont watch tv no internet its pretty awesome actually gives me a lot more time to spend with my family and my friends

580848 i am going to go for shecklers foundation if it was up to me id go for the kids

580851 india is rapidly becoming a global r amp d hub in several industries its scientists are doing sophisticated drug discovery for big pharma businessweek com 6 10 08 its engineers are designing key components of jetliners for boeing ba and airbus developing next generation networking equipment for companies like cisco systems csco and building auto bodies dashboards and power trains for such vehicle manufacturers as general motors gm indian companies are also innovating for the indian marketplace witness the 2 500 car by tata motors ttm
580852 the advantage comes in the form of an entrenched and vibrant democracy that will ultimately drive india to outperform china socially and economically messy frustrating and more often than not agonizingly slow indias democracy would seem to be chaotic at the surface

580880 you may vote for a person who is pro choice if you feel you have a moral reason to support the candidate for his stand on other issues
580881 its hard to find a candidate who supports all of the churchs teaching
580882 its a difficult time to decide how were voting especially this year
580883 there may be times when a catholic who rejects a candidates unacceptable position may decide to vote for that candidate for other morally grave issues
580884 for those who want to be told what to do this document does not tell them
580885 the reason this is important is no candidate this year and few candidates historically have perfectly lined up with catholic social teaching
580886 if you vote for someone who supports the war be actively involved in trying to change his mind
580887 were not interested in creating the united catholic states of america
580888 were not into endorsing party candidates or parties we want to focus on issues
580889 a catholic cannot vote for a candidate who takes a position in favor of an intrinsic evil such as abortion or racism if the voters intent is to support that position
580890 we dont want to tell anybody who to vote for you can be a catholic whos a democrat a catholic whos a republican but be a catholic first
580891 hes a name on a list a volunteer when are we going to start talking about gas prices jobs and the issues facing americans the mccain campaign is all done with the gotcha games
580892 he just shouldnt be representing catholics for the campaign its offensive
580893 my past continues to be a source of shame to me and unfortunately my family im not blaming anyone for this it was my own fault and while the revelation of my failing was deeply humiliating it was also an important wake up call for me over the past four years ive tried to make amends with family friends and supporters
580894 there is no doubt that the dramatic progress made in reducing abortions over the last 30 years now at their lowest number since 1974 will be rapidly reversed under a president obama
580895 appear to misunderstand and subsequently misrepresent the substance of church teaching on these difficult but important ethical questions
580896 our moral obligations to patients who exist in what has come to be called a persistent vegetative state
580897 m y father has judged that the burden of persisting in a vegetative state far outweighs the benefit of being sustained that way this in my view is a very catholic way of thinking
580898 that claim has no foundation in the text and is actually contradicted
580899 the church insists on the important distinction between validly withdrawing a life sustaining means because the means itself is burdensome and wrongly withdrawing it because in someones view life itself has become burdensome
580900 by omitting food and fluids what are we trying to achieve
580901 whose burden are we trying to ease assisted feeding is often not difficult or costly to provide in itself but the housing nursing care and other basic needs of a helpless patient can be significant to discontinue assisted feeding in order to be freed from such burdens puts the caregivers interests ahead of the patients even if we prefer not to recognize the reality of our choice
580902 three years from now im going to be sitting here crying my eyes out at the thought of you leaving for college in just a few days
580903 i have daughters and ive been thinking about this a lot and if they were faced with this decision i decided that at the end of the day i just want them to be happy

580916 this question is very important it shows that you have really lived your life for every body part that you gave me in the past i have told you was wrong and i have given you an example why but today is the day you need to learn this important lesson
580917 my dear the most important body part is your shoulder
580918 no it is because it can hold the head of a friend or loved one when they cry

580949 a la vista de los numerosos ataques que sufre la comunidad negra a manos del gobierno estadounidense que usted aspira a dirigir por qu no ha sido capaz de dedicar un solo momento a hablar con o desde la oprimida y explotada comunidad africana o negra
580950 esto es democracia en funcionamiento ha hecho una pregunta leg tima as que quiero responder
580951 pienso que est desinformado pues en realidad he hablado de todas las cuestiones que ha citado
580952 la situaci n es terrible si antes una familia se gastaba cerca de 80 euros ahora con suerte llega a los 15 euros
580953 por ahorrar no dejan ni propina el a o pasado pod amos sacar los camareros cerca de 50 euros y este verano la mejor semana sacamos 20 euros
580954 una raci n de fritura para dos personas la comparten entre cuatro y as con todo para vender un pescado m s grande depende mucho del esfuerzo del camarero porque los clientes no est n dispuestos a asumir esos gastos
580955 otros a os he llegado a preparar al d a m s de 200 espetos
580956 es el fruto del trabajo realizado en el pasado tambi n fue bueno ser n mero dos gan una gran cantidad de partidos fue duro
580957 tengo una gran cantidad de partidos en mis espaldas luch duro para llegar aqu fue duro jugar bien tras ganar en toronto la semana pasada
580958 no quiero ir a una residencia tan s lo me conformo con un peque o hueco de una habitaci n para tumbarme
580959 siempre tienen mucha prisa ocultan datos sobre su vida huyen del sitio donde comenzaron a sentirse mal y es dif cil convencerles
580960 animo a las personas en mi situaci n a comenzar un tratamiento a participar en talleres la cuesti n es entretenerse porque la verdadera lucha es estar bien ser feliz
580961 ahora llevo cuatro meses sin probar nada ni una cerveza
580962 sin embargo los comercios tradicionales saben mantener el tipo incluso despu s de 2007 porque son perseverantes
580963 habr a que seguir una l nea mucho m s tradicional para que no s lo haya un monumento sino que la monumentalidad abarque la ciudad en su totalidad
580964 aunque el comercio tradicional siempre se ha caracterizado por ser inventivo en la actualidad se tiene que trabajar muy duro para llegar a ser competitivo en la ciudad
580965 muchos de los nuevos comerciantes logran despuntar y son m s r pidos que sus antecesores porque salen al exterior a buscar nuevos productos
580966 malague os de pura cepa y relojeros de toda la vida
580967 con la llegada del reloj de cuarzo se rompe la tradici n mec nica en estos objetos y muchas tiendas deciden renovarse pero nosotros nos mantuvimos igual siempre como taller
580968 mantenernos impasibles a estos cambios ha reforzado la chispa de nuestro taller
580969 la especializaci n en este sector es importante talleres como el m o habr uno o dos en m laga porque ya no se forman nuevos relojes eso lleva toda una vida de trabajo
580970 el cliente quiere saber qui n le va a arreglar su reloj y como lo va a hacer de ah que la fidelidad de los usuarios sea latente
580971 el amor que siento a la mec nica del reloj lo transmito a mis clientes
580972 adem s mejoramos los precios de los productos y la oferta si los comparamos con los grandes comercios
580973 mantenemos la confianza en el cliente y eso hace que nuestra tienda siga activa
580974 la gente cuando pasa por aqu se asombra por la singularidad del negocio
580975 a pesar de todo a la vista est que mi negocio se mantiene y que mis ojos han visto muchos negocios de la zona convertirse en cad veres
580976 en estos negocios se vive del d a a d a porque son familiares y aqu no hay ni vacaciones ni paga extraordinaria
580977 la nica forma que tenemos para competir con los grandes comercios es la atenci n al cliente el trato cercano y los precios razonables
580978 por desgracia el futuro de la tienda se ve complicado porque despu s de m no creo que mis hijos contin en aunque mantengo la esperanza
580979 aunque siempre que hablamos de personas adictas al trabajo pensamos en ejecutivos porque son los m s llamativos lo cierto es que este perfil de personas puede ir desde el agricultor que planta lechugas hasta que se va el sol obsesionado por obtener m s y m s resultado hasta el alto ejecutivo o el ama de casa que tienen que tener la casa impecable los hijos perfectos que cocina pasteles y que se apunta a un curso de macram
580980 el mundo funciona gracias a ellos y los dem s son todos unos vagos sa es su mentalidad es m s a los adictos al trabajo les cuesta entender que sus trabajadores por ejemplo no sean como ellos que prefieran irse con sus familias o al cine antes que seguir en la empresa realmente no entienden que las motivaciones de los dem s no sean el trabajo
580981 hoy d a las empresas est n colocando a personas que podr an considerarse adictos al trabajo en puestos intermedios para que estimulen o presionen a los dem s premian m s su condici n personal de estar totalmente entregados a la empresa que sus cualidades para el puesto las empresas les hacen sentirse bien

581043 70 percent of americans with a religious affiliation say that many religions not just their own can lead to eternal life
581044 bolstered by the fact that among nondenominational church members responding to the pew survey the percentage of those claiming many religions can lead to eternal life is much lower
581045 for example 34 percent of nondenominational evangelicals agreed with the many religions option
581046 how much do you agree disagree if a person is sincerely seeking god he she can obtain eternal life through religions other than christianity
581047 shape of faith to come is in some ways discouraging christians are becoming more universalistic and lack biblical views on a host of other issues
581048 anguish and outrage concerning the american imperial adventure in iraq frequently bubble close to the surface
581049 operations such as blurring the issues invoking the divine flogging scapegoats slandering critics and reasserting ones devotions to traditional ideals become increasingly strained with repetition since a peoples capacity to tolerate contradiction is distinctly more finite that is an empires capacity to manifest them
581050 thank you for following the way of peace after moses jesus and mohammed
581051 often its the spirituality more than the theology that is a better ground for conversation

581053 when madeline albright was u s secretary of state she made an important speech indicating an apology for the cia backed coup in iran in l953 which overthrew the popular prime minister mossadeq he had threatened the west by nationalizing the iranian oil industry

581055 how is it possible to be a faithful christian in an american empire facilitated by a violent christian bible
581056 that the bible proposes the radicality of a nonviolent god struggling with the normalcy of a violent civilization
581057 the violent normalcy of human civilization is not the inevitable destiny of human nature

581062 they just keep knocking them out of the park ive seen every one of them
581063 i think this is going to address some major issues with marriages and its got enough evangelism in it that people can get saved
581064 obviously we think that marriage is a crucial issue to address in our culture inside and outside the church
581065 marriage has become simply a contract a piece of paper we hope that the movie is going to impact homes not only inside the church but outside the church because every one of us knows a couple that struggles either we are or we know somebody who is
581066 if couples learn some things out of this film that will help them in their marriage then it will be successful to us if we can help save some marriages that are on the brink of going off a cliff it would be great
581067 i think the things that this movie could do for peoples lives are immeasurable
581068 i think the message is timeless love is not based on an emotion its not birds chipping and flowers blooming all the time sometimes its hard and its a decision very often love starts with an action and then follows with an emotion rather than vice versa as we tend to think that it does
581069 what we keep hearing from those fight scenes from couples is do you guys have a camera in my house because my wife and i have had those fights
581070 i think thats why theyre so hard to watch because theyre so real this couple is fighting about real issues theyre fighting about finances theyre fighting because of miscommunication theyre fighting because he struggles with an internet pornography issue
581071 she catherine refers to caleb viewing trash on the internet so that when children are watching the movie it will go right over their head
581072 but every adult knows what were talking about we believe we can deal with a very sensitive subject without being graphic that we can address the issue without slapping people around with it or showing things that are inappropriate a family can still go and see this movie
581073 the opening weekend is the key and is so critical
581074 unfortunately we live in a society with movies where its market driven and box office driven
581075 and war broke out in heaven and the dragon and his angels were defeated and there was no longer a place for them in heaven

581080 weve got more than one camera plus i dont have to both direct and play a major role
581081 the foundation of marriage has been attacked devalued and redefined by many in our culture
581082 it is our desire to tell a story that would allow the audience to relate to common marital issues and then to take them down a path toward understanding principles for unconditioned love through the roles of husband and wife
581083 our hope would be that after viewing the film couples and singles hoping to marry would be challenged and exhorted to pursue god honoring relationships that reinforce the foundations of marriage in light of a relationship with jesus christ we want people to realize that fireproof does not mean the absence of fire but the ability to withstand it
581084 we could not be more pleased with our relationship with albany the police and fire departments offered their services and equipment and some officers volunteered their time and others received credit for training exercises
581085 the fire department even burned down an old house for us that is a pivotal role in the movie and gives kirks character the opportunity to rethink lifes priorities phoebe putney hospital let us film on site as well as provided some doctors offices as a set for some scenes more than 20 sets and a production office were provided by local businesses
581086 i just wanted to be part of something exciting that a church was doing on the quality level that sherwood has brought to the screen i wanted to be sure that my casting if it occurred would be of the lord and not just because i had more experience than others
581087 in my lifetime the divorce rate has climbed to one out of two marriages and the marriage rate has dropped 30 percent what if we can make a dent in those statistics
581088 if we go back to the idea of redeeming the time because the days are evil this is the best use of our ministry time
581089 we each have full time responsibilities at the church but this is just something else that we feel needs to be done and is worked into our schedule
581090 thats why you see all of these volunteers out here in the hot sun taking vacation and personal time away from their jobs to help make this movie we are preaching a two hour sermon in the format of a hollywood movie and will be able to reach people who would never set foot inside a church
581091 they are doing this for more than here more than now they have a sense that long after they have left this world this movie will still be telling a story of redemption and will represent what they feel is important in life
581092 fue una experiencia desgarradora no s lo por la informaci n sino porque su vida tambi n estuvo en peligro
581093 only the pure of heart would sacrifice themselves for the one they love
581094 if you want to come into a movie theater and have an experience not be told a story but actually have a physical emotional experience then this is the ride for you
581095 we had a great opening weekend with facing the giants and so it spread to other cities
581096 300 ans dhistoire de lartillerie et de la d fense
581097 cest loin d tre le cas ailleurs et notamment en europe si la r union poss de encore ces canons cest parce quil ny a jamais eu de fonderies dans l le en france les canons d suets taient sans cesse refondus pour r utiliser le m tal
581098 intimement li es lhistoire maritime car elles d fendaient les rades et les navires et qui pour 99 avaient d j servi bord de bateaux
581099 il nen existe que deux pi ces recens es travers le monde selon mes investigations lautre se trouve quelque part en afrique sans quil y ait plus de pr cisions
581100 nous avons galement lun des derniers exemplaires du gover anglais de la fin du xviiie si cle ajoute t il ce mod le a t imagin pour raccourcir la longueur des canons de marine afin de diminuer lencombrement bord il signe la transition entre le canon classique du milieu du xviiie et la caronade 1 il avait notamment le d faut davoir encore beaucoup trop de recul lors du tir il ny a eu que tr s peu de pi ces mises en circulation et ce dans la marine anglaise
581101 chasse roues ndlr aux angles des rues saint paul ou saint denis comme d coration dans les jardins et villes comme remblais
581102 il y en a notamment sous le barachois c t de lactuelle piscine je pense que si les travaux pr vus imposent de creuser on va en retrouver la pelle
581103 dans les ann es 30 la plus grande batterie de saint denis a t pr cipit e terre aff ts de canons et pi ces dartillerie compris dans le bassin existant l poque afin de le combler
581104 ce sont les villes qui cumulaient la plus grande activit maritime qui avaient le plus grand nombre de batteries 2
581105 pratiquement toute lhistoire de lartillerie avec ses moments cl s comme la r volution qui sest op r e en 1850 1860 avec le chargement des canons non plus par la bouche mais par la culasse
581106 de lhistoire de la d fense de l le il ne reste plus que les canons les aff ts m talliques de c te comme celui recens saint paul supportant un canon obusier fran ais de 1827 sont rares
581107 les lus oublient certains domaines du patrimoine on en fait un argument de campagne comme lenvironnement sans se donner les moyens de le d fendre et de le montrer
581108 gas is over 4 a gallon and yet she also recently voted against measures to prosecute gasoline price gougers
581109 dici la fin de lann e dun d samiantage l ger pour retirer les l ments utilis s pour lam nagement int rieur
581110 saint pierre le r sultat est primordial peu importe le reste on a gagn et cest tout ce quon va retenir
581111 hai muhammad siapakah yang dapat menghidupkan tulang belulang yang telah hancur luluh
581112 siapa pula yang sanggup menghidupkan tulang belulang yang telah hancur luluh itu
581113 ia akan dihidupkan oleh allah yang menciptakannya kali yang pertama dan dia maha tahu tentang segala makhluk
581114 i do not feel included in the planning process people like me are always left out
581115 im concerned the plan will be too influenced by those who have a lot of money
581116 a lot of people feel like it doesnt matter how you plan folks that have a lot of money or a lot of influence get to do what they want
581117 we engage in the public process we go to these meetings we do the hard work but at the end of the day our expectations are not met
581118 assuming people like me participate in the plan and the plan is carried out fairly by the city i think tulsa will change for the better as a result of it
581119 it goes well beyond that trying to change the culture and the climate so that theres a sense of security in our community so people just live their life and also let them know theres a group of men that care about them
581120 for them to be out there doing what they are doing it makes me feel food it makes me feel that my kids will be safe
581121 its sad that they havent caught the person and he may be out there doing other things and robbing other different stores
581122 healing the new childhool epidemics autism adhd asthma and allergies
581123 if everything is free of charge its value is very low if something must be paid back then they try their best to do it this is the system
581124 the government will distribute everything for them through a payback system otherwise controlling the aid will be very difficult
581125 we have received power tillers and diesel on credit from the government even then we still need more help to get bank loans so that we will have cash to hire field hands
581126 the world food programme is delivering rice for villagers even if they stop delivering rice villagers can feed themselves with their own income
581127 if the un cannot deliver rice and stops their assistance to us we will be in trouble we have no income now as our employers are finding it difficult to start their farming
581128 i have no job now and am relying on rice aid from the wfp all of us need jobs urgently to resume our lives we lost everything in the cyclone
581129 five of my six children were killed in the cyclone im now living with my granddaugther in this new house i lost everything in the storm
581130 we were staying in a thatched tent before my husband got this new house in a lucky draw
581131 we have nothing left we eat when food aid is delivered we eat when we can get day jobs at a construction site
581132 id like to personally thank joyce mentel and vixay zayas for the work theyve done on this project
581133 without their efforts our company would need be able to meet the demands of the burgeoning consumer market when demand increases the only way to provide for this change is an increase in technology most importantly we wont be laying anyone off all current employees in our yukiko schmahl county plant and all online casinos project employees will be guaranteed employment for 3 years
581134 we chose to use perl in our online casinos text studies because it is a lingual programming language
581135 and also because it is easy to combine with other programming languages perl is easily installed on linux platforms and modules can be compiled that allow us to communicate with database technologies
581136 with increased profits well be able to hire more employees and really grow our business
581137 were proud to announce news that our online casinos company has devised new algorithms and computer models for enhanced online casinos analysis
581138 and as a result were expecting nearly double last quarters profits in the coming months
581139 and were happy to also announce our own software team has developed important online casinos production algorithms that will boost our profits dramaticly
581140 mostly because well need time to train these employees to be as effective online casinos producers as possible
581141 well be hiring more workers within the next 6 months why because while some jobs will be made redundant in the new profit model we can take the talents of these valuable employees and parlay them into other equally paying jobs within our corporate structure
581142 were excited to learn that over 1000 new jobs will be created
581143 the mall traffic is ok but not very high quality now with over 1000 new people visiting each day business will surely skyrocket
581144 probably leave rates unchanged and give a no bias statement
581145 we expect the ecb to be on hold for at least the next 12 months
581146 to the mounting evidence that the eurozone economic downturn is deepening
581147 the ecb will no longer describe the economic fundamentals as sound
581148 we expect the risk of a much sharper downturn in the labour market to keep the ecb on hold despite the current inflation overshoot
581149 we wouldnt say it very loud but there may be fair chances that julys 4 1 per cent may have been the peak in inflation
581150 the eurozone economy is heading toward a stagnation phase bound to last at best a few months
581151 probably state that it is too early to deem as entrenched the recent downward movement in oil prices
581152 money statistics will be a key signal for the rate outlook
581153 a decisive inversion in the credit cycle may open the way to rate cuts in 2009
581154 if you dont have something nice to say do say it at all
581155 it feels good to behave the way i want to behave out there
581156 when he told me he felt fine it was his ballgame at that point
581157 we have all the confidence in the world in barry
581158 to go eight innings that was very very impressive this guy can pitch
581159 when you go up against peavy especially in san diego you know its going to be a battle
581160 the key is to get that out of my head that im facing peavy
581161 we just have to play better everybody has to play better myself included
581162 he was solid out there tonight very much in command
581163 ive seen him do that throughout his career when he was with the as and i was with the angels
581164 he had three pitches working tonight i thought the change was very very good
581165 im glad we didnt wreck i just wished it wouldnt have started raining so hard and we could have raced a little longer
581166 i was turning the wiper on in the low speed corners and i couldnt really use it
581167 i couldnt see through the back window there was very very low visibility
581168 as we circled around i kept hoping id see the 5 car race winner fellows sitting off on the side somewhere
581169 it was raceable as long as you could see where you were going
581170 as long as you could get the rain off of your windshield
581171 the priority in this sport has to be our drivers and you had a number of drivers on the radio saying they cant see and are hydroplaning under caution
581172 i dont think as a series we did a good job of listening to those so we fell victim
581173 when drivers are saying enough is enough we need to heed that caution and we did not today
581174 i have to be honest i had a lot of fun today this is pretty cool its the first points race in the rain
581175 unfortunately this game they judge you for that they criticize winning or losing a game
581176 thats the way it goes it happened in the past and theres nothing i can really do
581177 quite frankly i was lucky to not give up nine runs with what i had going on
581178 we have done some rehearsals and in one rehearsal we encountered periodic rain
581179 that may have turned out to be a test for us so we are very confident of producing a successful opening ceremony
581180 i dont know if we want to play the cardinals every day because theyre pretty good but howard seems to play pretty good against them
581181 i think he feels comfortable here hes around his people and hes relaxed
581182 if they lose faith in me id probably lose faith in myself
581183 but theyve had faith in me all along and i knew i could do it
581184 ive been pretty much streaky i think most power guys are like that
581185 you always hear that term that they come in bunches
581186 i was thinking of giving up but i carried on only for the beijing olympics
581187 i am glad zhao and feng came back and showed they are close to getting back to their best
581188 we can see they still play high quality volleyball they still show motivation determination and teamwork
581189 the scene was overwhelming and i cant explain the stench
581190 every room was filled with animals and they were in the beds and everywhere
581191 the risks associated with allowing this cross bred cat into the country when we already have up to 12 million feral cats wreaking havoc on native fauna are simply too great
581192 that is why i have banned the import of these cats immediately

581222 no s si tuvimos 20 o m s reuniones previas la organizaci n fue ejemplar todav a para dar a conocer el campeonato se convoc a una junta de prensa en donde cuidamos todos los detalles la base del xito fue la planeaci n en ese entonces aportamos 180 mil pesos a trav s del ampayeo uniformes pelotas la transportaci n interna de los equipos y hasta facilitamos la unidad deportiva nazario ortiz garza para juegos nocturnos en donde nos hicimos cargo de pagar el alumbrado el ingeniero ricardo plata manej todo en gran forma y al igual que el profesor jes s gallegos y baltazar gonz lez trabaj intensamente la planeaci n del campeonato se hizo como corresponde a un torneo de esa magnitud
581223 como titular del deporte en el municipio asumo la responsabilidad de todo pero se dieron muchos apoyos y el presupuesto sencillamente se termin hemos apoyado al softbol en el nacional master varonil y en un femenil eso es en dos a os y medio que llevamos al frente de la comisi n municipal del deporte
581224 el se or baltazar gonz lez se acerc con a o y medio de anticipaci n incluso antes de tener la sede del campeonato nacional master varonil ya cuando se le ofreci apoyo entonces pidi el torneo y se trabaj conjuntamente para alcanzar el xito el cual fue reconocido en todas partes el campeonato fue exitoso porque se plane con anticipaci n y se trabaj adecuadamente en todos los detalles ahora apenas hubo tres reuniones y lo nico que entregamos es una carta aval que se nos pidi para presentarla a la federaci n mexicana de softbol

581230 the impact of oil prices on local economies is extremely big

581233 nos encant la idea el tema lo grabamos hace cuatro d as la inspiraci n surgi r pido porque nos vimos reflejadas en la historia que trata de un hada que descubre su talento pero no quiere aprovecharlo la moraleja es averigua de lo que eres capaz desarr llalo y cree en ti s la mejor

581239 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
581240 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
581241 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
581242 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
581243 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
581244 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
581245 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
581246 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
581247 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
581248 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
581249 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
581250 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
581251 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
581252 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
581253 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
581254 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
581255 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
581256 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
581257 for it matters not how small the beginning may seem to be
581258 people are always blaming circumstances for what they are the people who get on in this world are the people who get up
581259 if you think you can you can and if you think you cant youre right
581260 he who has never failed somewhere that man cannot be great
581261 recipe for success study while others are sleeping work while others are
581262 success is not so much what we have as it is what we are
581263 hold a picture of yourself long and steadily enough in your minds eye and you
581264 the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
581265 success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm
581266 those who have attained things worth having in this world have worked while
581267 be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid
581268 to be a champion you have to believe in yourself when nobody else will
581269 most people give up just when theyre about to achieve success they give up at the last minute of the game one foot from a
581270 if you envy successful people you create a negative force field of attraction that
581271 it is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped
581272 one half of life is luck the other half is discipline and thats the important half
581273 yesterday i dared to struggle today i dare to win
581274 look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end
581275 even if youre on the right track youll get run over if you just sit there
581276 when i was young i observed that nine out of ten things i did were failures so i
581277 success is like a ladder and no one has ever climbed a ladder with their hands
581278 nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude
581279 i can accept failure but i cant accept not trying
581280 often the difference between a successful man and a failure is not ones better

581283 kenapa saya mahu mencabar shabery senang sahaja kerana umno kemaman memerlukan seorang yang boleh memberikan fokus kepada bagi kerpentingan ahli bahagian ini
581284 umno kemaman memerlukan timbalan ketua bahagian yang bekerja secara sepenuh masa untuknya bagi membantu ketua bahagian yang kini adalah menteri besar
581285 sebab itu dia boleh berdebat dengan datuk seri anwar ibrahim baru baru ini tetapi kerja belum tentu bahkan tidak
581286 bagi saya shabery tidak patut berdebat dengan anwar baru baru ini inilah masalahnya apabila shabery tidak sedar anwar bukan calang calang orang untuk berdebat dengannya
581287 cadangan usul mencalonkan tengku razaleigh kerana dirasakan beliau orang yang layak untuk memulihkan umno yang sedang tenat sekarang

581289 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
581290 given that they have announced these parks i think the government will want to show that citizens have scope to use them
581291 china wants to show it is progressing in human rights
581292 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
581293 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
581294 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact
581295 hiv aids continues to be a public health emergency that has not received adequate nor appropriate attention as a nationwide priority
581296 to make measurable progress against hiv we need to know whether infection rates are going up which groups are becoming infected and which prevention activities reduce new infections

581312 i still think the maritime park is the communitys best hope for a win
581313 i am sick and tired of people slandering my good name
581314 while i sometimes try to bring humor to my work with co workers i have never intended to offend anyone with my remarks humorous or not
581315 i am extremely embarrassed to have allowed myself to be placed in the position of being the subject of this type of complaint
581316 it would not be prudent for me to comment at this time
581317 since this all came up ive worked around females without any issue
581318 man this is hard you know what in the world is the answer to this
581319 like indicating you know he might want an answer to number five
581320 we asked for some guidance on that from the florida department of law enforcement
581321 they indicated that without the knowledge of what they were talking about that investigation couldnt go forward
581322 all i know is that someone said i was trying to tell them answers but i waved goodbye and didnt say a word
581323 it was totally false just a political ploy to slander my name
581324 mcnesbys dislike and anger over ms sievers actions is well known within the sheriffs office and the pensacola area community

581330 you have to put yourself out there and prove yourself that youre in it for the long haul and not just some twitter spammer who follows everyone
581331 what i missed what i didnt want to miss what i caught and hated what i caught and liked
581332 knowing that 1700 people follow me on twitter doesnt phase me its actually kinda cool
581333 i dont like people to follow me unless ive met them
581334 i dont care what some joe schmoe in seattle is doing hes going for coffee and i dont care but once i meet someone whether virtually or in real life its great
581335 it was as if wed been friends all of our lives
581336 weve grown six fold in the last 10 to 12 months both in active users and updates
581337 it was really obvious that electric was the right choice for the united states it makes so much more sense than hydrogen and other technologies
581338 the militarys had extremely high powered electric vehicles for quite a long time and it was just a matter of time before they came down to the private sector
581339 it takes a lot of sophistication to get a manufacturing operation started
581340 the motorcycle industry wants to ignore this which is part of the reason i had to do it
581341 the big companies are very invested in gasoline motors thats what they built their reputation and heritage on
581342 its not just the little cucumber sandwiches and punch its a party
581343 and its great because men are more involved with their children and it all starts at the beginning and they get to open presents too

581357 it is bad but its not as bad as other places
581358 there seems to be no increase in the number of cases weve handled regarding bankruptcies or other debt problems over the past couple of years
581359 about 17 percent of all our legal aid cases are dealing with bankruptcy or debt problems
581360 getting hard numbers has been difficult because virginia is a non judicial state so you cant just go pull up a record and get a total count of all filings
581361 counties like lee wise and dickenson have a pretty high share of the high cost loans
581362 between 2004 and 2006 for example washington county had 867 high cost loans for home purchase or refinance that is 18 percent of all its loans thats significant
581363 weve got a lot of high cost loans here when a lot of those people could have qualified for a conventional mortgage
581364 its nothing like a local bank the character of the lenders is changing folks are approached by telephone to get these loans it looks good with no down payment and no interest payments but when you look behind the curtain its not
581365 in many cases they lenders come to the house for closing six months after refinancing the lenders are nowhere to be seen and people find they cant make the payments
581366 it used to be we had people with a traditional fixed rate mortgage who would get behind in their payments and we would work with them
581367 the problem now is a large percentage are variable rate loans the terms of the loan are not always disclosed or not disclosed in a way people can understand and after the first six months people find out they cant make those payments
581368 we deal with a lot of loan companies and mortgage companies the predatory lenders who make these adjustable rate loans and when people cant pay the 1 000 monthly payment they foreclose
581369 people are getting horrible loans that adjust every six months i worked with one woman whose double wide trailer payment was 1 025 and has gone up every six months
581370 you want to ask them what were they thinking but you cant say that
581371 a lot of people are dealing with just trying to make ends meet
581372 it used to be chapter 13 bankruptcy was a perfect vehicle for people in trouble to keep their home
581373 these new loans we cant solve the variable rate means you cant look into a plan to come out of the debt
581374 we have not had any significant changes in our delinquencies
581375 it always has its ups and downs but its a small percentage our delinquencies ranged from 2 4 percent during the past year but usually about half a percent to 1 5 percent truly go bad
581376 part of the problem nationally is the underwriting standards were compromised
581377 at trisummit bank all our loans are done on a traditional basis we verify employment look at the equity in the house were not doing 100 percent financing or refinancing and most importantly does this person have the capacity to repay the loan and have a history of good credit
581378 under the old law people could file for bankruptcy but still keep their house if they could make the payments
581379 since 2005 it is much more expensive and much more complicated to file for bankruptcy now if you file more than likely they will foreclose on your home

581495 we made enough progress on most of the major issues togive the negotiators confidence to continue talking through thenight without a strike
581496 there are still sticking points but theyre confident theycan reach an agreement
581497 people are going to drastic measures to pay for their childrens education
581498 with all the uncertainty in the economy and the job market the wrong move could cause the parent to lose their home or pay hefty fees
581499 thats a dangerous game that could lead to a downward spiral
581500 if you dont have the money today then will you really have the money tomorrow when the bill is due
581501 but it looks promising that it would grow over the next several years its just not the comprehensive solution to the student loan problem
581502 normally i would have took out a small loan or put it on my credit card
581503 it doesnt have to be a 40 000 a year school
581504 there are good schools that cost less than private and those are much better options
581505 had to go well i knew that it was going to be a tough road if i couldnt get an indication of interest from barnes amp noble
581506 when youre this geographically spread out you have to be sure you have good interpersonal relationships with people
581507 you dont want to just always be asking them in an e mail are you finished with that packaging yet
581508 we show them colors or open up a ziploc bag and dump out a bunch of prototypes instead of just saying heres a product
581509 debbie bennett says a wal mart buyer she met with recently was excited to see lightwedge making a product in a color shed chosen
581510 we talk about what the barnes amp noble customer would like and how were going to sell it in the stores
581511 we work much more closely with them than other vendors who tend to show you things when theyre in production or already done
581512 we look carefully at every idea that comes in and in some cases try to coach the inventor on how to improve or refine their concept
581513 i woke up to the reality that you cant be a one product player and expect to see growth
581514 you have to grow through line extensions and getting into other product categories and price points
581515 the market for reading aids and book lights is growing
581516 and lightwedge has grown to be the largest of the three or four vendors we work with
581517 were working with them on a plan to aggressively go after infringers

581519 this is what our money from the oil bought for these people
581520 if you dont have something to say dont say anything
581521 is another proof that these people are not interested in the welfare well being of the palestinians not on their daily needs and or even in their national political program

581542 the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago
581543 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
581544 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
581545 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
581546 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
581547 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
581548 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
581549 most demolitions are of multi storey buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
581550 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
581551 it was an eye opener to realise that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable
581552 imagine your children leaving in the morning for school and returning later in the day to find their home their whole world has disappeared while they were gone

581563 what i do with my life or body doesnt effect anyone but myself
581564 this years presidential election is between a turd sandwich and a douche
581565 every soul in this realm is part of the whole there is no need for privacy among them they are communal constantly sharing lifes experiences with one another all souls have a lesson to teach for every life is filled with different challenges and answers to those challenges also no one sleeps in this realm for why would someone want to miss one second of havens splendor
581566 from what i learned from my brother there are no houses in haedes either
581567 for another reason entirely i assure you here privacy is not necessary in haedes it is not allowed
581568 if privacy is not necessary why are we going somewhere private
581569 it is not necessary for them dear maelduin you and i are another story entirely
581570 maelduin that is not what we came here to discuss as much as i dislike speaking their names let us talk now about the titans and your connection to them
581571 shiba the lone female titan was prophesied to bear a child to the titan darkness their son would be the culmination of all evil in existence and an heir to the throne held by his father from this coupling was born shaddo a being not just born of evil but also with his mothers cunning and craftiness he was born in the shadows and comprised of them as well but unbeknownst to either his father or mother there was to be born another the dark prophet nin gauble did not inform the others of the second child a child born of light and goodness
581572 how could two evil beings have a child that wasnt evil
581573 for two reasons the first is that there must be a balance between good and evil just as nacht was born in later times with tag so a boy named light came into being alongside his brother secondly shiba was the bearer of the essence of love
581574 it is possible because of the nature of the eternal essences
581575 shiba was the vessel of love during the reign of the titans and it proved to be their undoing had she not been light could not have been born and the forces of good would have had no leader to rally around
581576 shiba was a seductress capable of enticing anyone to carry out her whims
581577 a boy of flaxen gold hair he radiated a cleansing white light that bathed all in its brilliance
581578 the pain she felt at being away from her son devastated shiba
581579 the child light was quickly found by a band of warriors that opposed the titans these fighters did not know why they were drawn to the woods at the southern tip of atlantia but they also could not resist its call the child was taken north past the land of the stone races to the first vestiges of human civilization in the universe
581580 what do you know of the universe you speak of a wholeness a vastness to all things yet everything seems to occur on one planet are there others have you been there
581581 maelduin what i know of the universe is what ive experienced my universe is one planet one world that is all one truly knows of the eternal existence around them are there other planets im sure there are have i been there most certainly not
581582 to say haven and haedes exist on another planet is just a way for the uninitiated to understand the concept of the two realms it would be just as if saying haven were located in the clouds hanging in the sky and haedes was a fiery pit beneath the planets surface all three realms of the dead exist solely in the ethereal and all existence is dependent upon the ethereal for that is the reservoir of souls
581583 somewhat there are certain ways to travel into the ethereal realms and back again but only a chosen few have the ability or knowledge to accomplish that feat before you ask yes you are one of the few it is your essence your soul that allows it
581584 so if not all human souls are able why are they so important
581585 were there no souls of silver no essences brought forth to mankind the world wouldve remained in darkness forever
581586 and lights arrival had changed something no one had anticipated
581587 shiba and light did talk and shiba told him why she was there she knew that if she did not take his life the other titans would destroy them both light knew this as well and when shiba finally drew her sword and ran it into his chest he knew it was inevitable
581588 the pain shiba felt at slaying her son tormented the titans spirit as she rejoined her brethren
581589 at lights death the last vestiges of light were extinguished evil won thankfully that information was lost on the rebels
581590 propheteus had foreseen this moment the time when the titans began their fall
581591 what propheteus failed to inform each about was that the essence shiba carried would need a new host
581592 most importantly being the vessel of love put each in touch with the doings of the other three essences
581593 after discussing what had happened with his comrades the beholder surmised that if they were to eliminate the other three holders of the essences then they would have the power for themselves and could finally defeat the titans
581594 he asked for eachs help in easing his mind and each obliged he took the last remnants of gilmores mind and transplanted it into his sword drago anyone who was to slay gilmore and pick up the sword of drago would instantly have his sense of self washed away and replaced with gilmores shattered mind the bad news was that gilmore felt the need to feed on souls to sustain him residue from shepherds bloodlust found its home in the hunger causing him an insatiable desire to consume all life
581595 the beholder and his brother genepool were the next to score a victory over a titan
581596 when the beholder was fighting cubis mentally the titan was able to draw the beholders soul into the fight
581597 magrath however fed on the bodies of his victims growing not just stronger but physically larger
581598 the tradeoff for the essence of chaos was styxs sanity she had presumed the battle to be an easy one though magrath was an intelligent being styx was much more accomplished in the mental arena she had underestimated her opponent a concept she would never have considered possible styx was known for her ability to judge people and situations and her instincts had failed her it was all she could think of for days afterwards until she was obsessed with tracing her missteps this obsession and the fact that she knew she had judged someone incorrectly tore her mind to tatters
581599 yes and what you saw was her talking to someone she knew she could lie to her attitude towards you when you meet will certainly be very different from her reaction with the others and i assure you the two of you will meet in due time use caution when talking to her maelduin she cannot only manipulate time and space with ease but ones own mind as well
581600 very well in fact we have a mutual understanding as rulers of realms we have to keep things running smoothly lillith enjoys a similar relationship with styx i highly doubt you will be able to leave here and be reborn without first chatting with styx in person as it were
581601 not to worry she has quite a fondness for you and your siblings
581602 when the time came however styx had recovered enough to be instrumental in fighting against the remaining titans
581603 the titans marshaled the remnants of their forces and marched on atlantia
581604 the titans had broken through the gates of the city and were slaughtering anyone they encountered on the streets
581605 bedlam the entropic would twist the minds of his victims and control them via his own mind
581606 the only titan that did not participate in the carnage was nin gauble and for good reason
581607 once they had reached the temple they were met by six ancients
581608 the battle raged for days as the ancients fended off the titans attack
581609 the hunger had battled against gibbring from the moment the fight began
581610 the will cosmic was nothing but a mind on the air but a powerful mind that could alter and create new realities better than styx could dream of
581611 the five titans remaining continued to fight but the end had already begun propheteus took council with the will and power cosmic and told him of an amazing prophecy they would create a new universe one of light and order all they had to do was summon this new existence from the void having opened the door to the void by casting gibbring into it the will and power cosmic abided by his words from the void came tag and a new day began with the first sunrise
581612 all does not end well as in tags wake came nacht darker of heart than any titan nacht was the embodiment of evil skeletal in form and dripping in shadows nacht was the unexpected consequence of the need for balance propheteus had not informed the cosmics that nacht would come into being for fear they could not go though with what had to be done this was not the first time and certainly not the last that not informing someone of an entire prophecy has had unintended costs
581613 but nachts birth was necessary and isnt he your father as well how can you say it was costly
581614 coming to the truth of the matter and accepting said truth do not always happen at once
581615 and yes maelduin nacht is my father and i love him as much as i love my mother i just cannot be near him as i simply cannot bear to be near that much darkness nor can he stand the light i bring
581616 so what happened to the last five titans i know theyre still alive
581617 nacht had been banished from atlantia and tag spirited away into seclusion on the island
581618 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
581619 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
581620 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding by travers and milgram
581621 via the lens provided on the world by messenger we find that there are about 7 degrees of separation among people they wrote
581622 they could create large meshes of people who could be mobilized with the touch of a return key
581623 they have the right to be out without being questioned
581624 how many drownings does it take before the public realizes that the water safety decisions at those beaches are made in some office in manhattan by people who know nothing about ocean lifeguarding
581625 theyre made in union offices by peter stein and the people he makes supervisors through patronage
581626 shes entitled to her views but i just wish she had some evidence
581627 there are rigorous rules in place for our beaches and pools for how many lifeguards we need and how they must be deployed
581628 if there are disagreements of a professional or personal nature between janet fash and peter stein thats not our bailiwick
581629 you cant prevent people from being active in the union but theres no patronage
581630 the message to them is that your chief is speaking out and this is what youre getting because of it
581631 no one not the lifeguards the public or even the city has been able to break peter steins stranglehold on the lifeguard system
581632 yeah not sure what happened just got new battery less than 30 minutes ago and my car is stalling

581636 the dealership costs an arm and a leg i know a really good guy
581637 you know they take advantage of women i had a lady right before you who paid 6 000 for a new engine at the dealership my guy would only charged 3 000 dealership charges women more
581638 its a good thing i dont need a new engine
581639 look i may not know a lot about cars but i do know what i want i want you to take me to the dealership thank you
581640 heres my card find out how much it costs then call me my guy will do it for half and i will tow you for free

581664 due to the fact that we have now had three known incidents of shop lifting involving the one coloured girl plus friends who has come in with two or three others coloureds sic
581665 if any group of aboriginals mixed or otherwise comes into the shop you will ask them to leave this does not include any customers of a long term basis say to them they are not be allowed in sic but can come in individually if they are willing to be searched on their way out
581666 if they ask why it is because of a recent spate of shoplifting involving people of their appearance if they start yelling or otherwise call the police
581667 a full blood her skin was whatever you want to call it chocolate or something
581668 i had a very angry reaction to the shoplifting and spoke to staff and gave them that memo and we had a meeting afterwards and it wasnt enforced

581707 both parties are talking the green bay packers and brett
581708 and i think the discussions are moving ahead i would hope that we would have something resolved by monday
581709 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
581710 primarily it starts with the fact does brett want to play football
581711 the second is do the packers want him to play for the packers those are the two principal points that have to be resolved and only two parties can make that determination not me
581712 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially
581713 im not looking for things to interject myself to its an issue that needs to be addressed because of the competing interests you want to make sure its done properly and within our rules this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
581714 whats going on between brett and the organization is something that the players and coaches we cannot handle
581715 were not involved in it i think they did a good job from a responsibility standpoint dealing with it for about two days but the focus has been on improving
581716 today was our first bump in the road in terms of having too many negative things happen in practice and i think thats a credit to their focus and their energy level and staying true to its training camp
581717 everybody is going through it and theyve done a really good job no one is really talking about it frankly

581729 la isla del tesoro que desapareci de la cartograf a mexicana
581730 para saber si al norte de cayo arenas arrecife alacr n y las islas de cabo catoche exist an otros accidentes topogr ficos
581731 en realidad no se trataba del comienzo de las negociaciones sino precisamente de su final es decir que ya todo estaba acordado
581732 el 4 de agosto de 1998 el legislador nacionalista del pan jos ngel conchello quien era presidente de la comisi n de relaciones exteriores del senado muri en un extra o accidente carretero
581733 es tut mir leid dass sie in letzter zeit nicht die zeitung gelesen haben das ganze wird jetzt immer bekannter
581734 dr mitchell ist ein gro artiger amerikaner aber wir teilen nicht seine ansichten zu diesem thema
581735 they challenge people to find themselves about to throw a punch to walk away or else face the prospect of killing someone and doing a long time in jail as a result
581736 the idea came from the family members of the victims
581737 the message is stop one punch being thrown and save two lives from being destroyed
581738 we want to make sure that if people behave that way then they are punished appropriately
581739 when dwaynes offender got off it was our aim to do everything that we possibly could to deter anybody else or any other family having to go through what we had to go through
581740 we felt let down by the justice system and anything that we could have done to get this law passed was all that we were aimed at doing
581741 we hope that even if it does save just one life then the ad campaign has helped
581742 sometimes i think time goes fast and sometimes it goes slow but theres been a lot of effects with my family
581743 all i can say is that this new one punch amendment to the criminal code homicide act is a good thing
581744 it may be that they dont even receive huge sentences but the fact is someone will be held accountable for what happened
581745 there are signs that the economy is slowing but there are still lots of strong features of the australian economy theres still lots of reasons why we are in good shape compared with all the other major economies in the world
581746 we had a situation where it was over heating where government spending was growing too fast we had inflation at a 16 year high the former government was not investing in skills and infrastructure
581747 but its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures
581748 that will keep the economy ticking along reasonably well in my view
581749 at the end of the day we just dont know we are in the hands of qantas as to whether these incidents are part of a pattern we should be concerned about we have asked the company for a briefing to tell us whats going on our members are concerned but they are not concerned enough that they wouldnt be prepared to go to work
581750 i think its a tick in the box for qantas because they operate to such high safety standards
581751 the air traffic controllers contacted the pilot when they thought they saw smoke coming from the back of the aircraft
581752 the pilots would have had a warning from the flight management system the pilot decided to return to sydney they flew out over the ocean to dump fuel because they were overweight for landing
581753 about five minutes after taking off it was very obvious the plane was very low in the sky it was very strange
581754 for 45 minutes we did not know what was going on there was an announcement once every 40 minutes the plane circled for about an hour and a half dumping fuel from the plane
581755 the 767 has three independent hydraulic systems on board so that if one springs a leak there are two others to back it up the safety of the aircraft was not at risk
581756 there was no safety issue at any time the qantas group operates more than 330 000 sectors each year and air turnbacks are extremely rare
581757 better yet ive used the money ive saved on gas since then to fully pay for my upcoming diving vacation in fiji
581758 i spend less than 10 a week on gas for my car now even at these prices
581759 and the trip to work costs me about 1 00 each way with my annual pass id be crazy not to do it
581760 ive uh been in guant namo bay for two years
581761 como me gustar a acariciarte las tetas con suavidad hasta hacer poner tus pezones duros
581762 pues a mi me gusta mucho la verdura para cenar m s que la sopa incluso
581763 lamer a todo tu cuerpo muy despacio hasta notar que tus estremecimientos me vuelven a excitar
581764 c mo me hubiera gustado conocerte cuando estabas sola all en la universidad e invitarte al cine hablar y hablar mientras cen bamos en una terraza junto al mar
581765 c mo me hubiera gustado desnudarte a besos despu s en tu habitaci n del hotel
581766 has estado alguna vez en logro o bien esto nos puede pasar o no yo no digo que nos pase a mi a veces me pasa incluso me veo fumando el t pico cigarro de despu s de la conjunci n feliz de los respectivos l quidos aunque yo no me lo fumaba incluso cuando fumaba
581767 quiere venir conmigo luego vivo aqu al lado y necesito una ducha para quitarme el olor a merluza a la plancha me ha gustado su sonrisa y me gustar a besarla
581768 no te preocupes yo te enjabonar y te secar hasta notar el verdadero olor de tu piel despu s abrir tu cama blanca
581769 tengo tanto sue o que me ir a a dormir ahora mismo

581773 kinder warum klingt ihr alle gleich das deutschpop wunder als schrecken ohne ende
581774 neue texter hat das land deutsche k nstler und die alte liebe muttersprache
581775 he does not believe that there will be nationalization of banco de venezuela
581776 the announcement is part of the destruction of the private sector of venezuela
581777 from now on the private banking sector is against the wall with this decision you create uncertainty because why invest if the state can come and take it all
581778 with this the plan of having banks that sell the structured notes and have losses capitalize their institution collapses because this purchase is seen as the beginning of a plan that may nationalize the whole banking sector
581779 if you or i had any intention of defrauding the government of a couple of million dollars wed be thrown in jail
581780 why arent the executives facing such charges for having defrauded the government of billions of dollars
581781 xochicalco la casa de las flores punto tur stico en cuernavaca
581782 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
581783 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
581784 i hit a lapped car with no brake lights i have no idea who it was
581785 i couldnt see 5 feet in front of me down the straightaway under caution somebody stopped i locked up all four and boom its just not right
581786 we are totally aware there is one issue on the table and that is human rights either you say because of some serious human rights issues we close the door deliver a vote that is regarded as a sanction and hope things evolve better the other way is to bet on openness we are taking the bet that we will see many changes
581787 the games are going to beijing because its a show the spectacle lives on and needs new and exciting places
581788 we need china to act as a check on the u s
581789 the u s is the only superpower it dominates everything including the olympics and the medal tables
581790 to advance the social agenda of china including human rights
581791 and im not convinced that the way to get china to respond positively is to splash headlines in the western press
581792 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
581793 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
581794 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
581795 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of the good
581796 and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to
581797 it is very disappointing to see the new cabinet list
581798 the new cabinet cannot give thais any hope in dealing with the economic situation
581799 with nonstop protests against the government samak had no choice but to replace some of his unpopular ministers
581800 also regrettable but i dont think china is regressing the way that russia is we have a greater opportunity to work in a cooperative way with china
581801 we understand as the dalai lama does that tibet is part of china but we hope tibetans are not repressed or oppressed
581802 you dont want to go over there and insult the chinese
581803 it would not be good for our relations i certainly dont think the president would or should go over there and be confrontational at the same time i think the president can in a very diplomatic style make it clear what we stand for and believe in
581804 i see a steady progression in russia of more and more repression of rights and the disappearance of semblances of democracy
581805 we have to deal with them negotiate with them especially in light of their hoard of petrodollars but we cant sit by and watch a country murder people in england
581806 using tabloids oprah people mag the children and whatever it takes to get elected
581807 this years state budget dedicates more than 1 7 billion in direct property tax relief to new jersey homeowners and tenants
581808 despite significant reductions in spending we were able to preserve rebates for 90 percent of last years recipients
581809 this property tax relief is much needed and we want to ensure that all eligible residents have the opportunity to apply
581810 the august 15 deadline is only about two weeks away and many potential applicants still need time to file extending the deadline to october 31 will help to ensure that everyone has the chance to participate
581811 republican john mccain and democrat barack obama are once again tied in the latest gallup poll daily obama received a brief increase in support near the conclusion of his overseas trip last week gaining a nine percentage point advantage in july 24 26 polling but that bounce disappeared almost quickly as it emerged
581812 famous for no reason just a pretty face the ad implies but loitering below is something more nefarious obama dog whistles the ad hitting old racists in the sweet spot could f k these white girls
581813 ive covered a lot of campaigns and ive never seen anything like this
581814 presidential election campaigns usually youre working all the time you get to the hotel at two in the morning and youre back on the plane at six but mccain does one event a day one event its unbelievable
581815 with over 30 000 books the average waterstone s has a lot of stories to tell
581816 but we want more they say everyone has a story in them so let it out
581817 your best pals are happy to listen to your rambling romantic sob stories once maybe twice but dont be tempted to go on and on
581818 channel your obsessive thoughts weepiest self pitying moments and bouts of vengeful fury into the concise elegant japanese poetic form haiku
581819 i thought youd visit new york city is so close the phone doesnt ring
581820 submit your haiku here your comrades in frustration amp devastation amp misery amp rage will read them and you might even feel better
581821 i love tuscaloosa i also believe it sprung up from the riverbanks for the solitary purpose of making me crazy every time i go back i fall in love with it again especially the language people there give a damn about everything and they like talking about it
581822 flying lessons being the rage among young women in the years just after amelias flight
581823 sugar get up and get dressed and pack your school clothes and dont you dare forget those new red shoes nobody at the river bend hunting clubs seen hide nor hair of your daddy this week and ive had it up to here with his gallivanting around well come back for your play pretties next week
581824 the teacher grabbed my wrist and jinkie took one more puff exhaled thoughtfully then pointed at her with her chesterfield
581825 by the time we started high school i knew i had erred in ever thinking jinkie strong but i did not care anything could hurt her and did only she wouldnt let on and i loved her all the more for this what she was was fearless and fearless passes for strong if you dont look too close
581826 one of the best trial lawyers in virginia a charming robust man whose genuine decency never failed to influence a jury and whose capacity to take a witness apart and not seem like a showboat had served him well for 30 years of practice
581827 only thing that matters in a murder case is did the fellow whos dead need to be killed and did the right fellow do the job
581828 this is some of the best diving ive seen anywhere
581829 i went to turks and caicos every day it was the same its neat and everything but its the same thing twice a day
581830 a funny thing happened on the way to the forum
581831 be realistic about how much time or money youre willing to put into the project
581832 its not a bargain if it just sits in the garage and never gets used
581833 my philosophy is if you can buy it old for as much as or less than something new then you have made a great investment theres a misconception that antiques are fragile but if theyve lasted 80 to 100 years then you know theyre good sturdy pieces
581834 i just want to see it i dont want to buy it
581835 to me yankas life story is very bound up in her music
581836 its incredibly striking and also completely unique in soviet era rock music she was the only woman really doing what people here would consider indie rock setting an example i find compelling
581837 when i was growing up we respected russian cultural heritage
581838 but my parents were political refugees so that was taboo
581839 i grew up during the reagan 80s and i would liken being russian in this country then to being muslim after 9 11
581840 every night the news basically said the soviets wanted to nuke us
581841 people would come up to me and say nasty things if they heard me speaking russian to my grandmother who spoke no english halloween one year somebody wrote commies go home on our driveway with shaving cream
581842 it just struck me one day i need to go back to russia learn russian and find my family
581843 people always have been and always will be fascinated by cases like this
581844 crimes that occur in places where we dont expect them to happen
581845 whether the national media starts devoting broader coverage will not depend on its news value of course but the amount of disturbing information that comes out especially suspicions involving the husband
581846 weve made a lot of progress in terms of race and gender in this country
581847 but this story shows that some old attitudes havent died
581848 want skin she cant wait to get her hands on
581849 writing novels to me is basically a kind of manual labor
581850 i have to pound the rock with a chisel and dig out a deep hole before i can locate the source of creativity
581851 the piece really requires the viewers imagination to complete it
581852 at that heightened moment there is still a possibility of change the man can get up and rescue the child and possibly rescue his environment
581853 years ago my mother used to say to me shed say in this world elwood you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant well for years i was smart i recommend pleasant you can quote me on that
581854 mrs watts those peaches are not fittin to eat i tried one a while ago and they have no flavor whatsoever
581855 the first thing i wanted to do was street course its basically just riding continuously around the park
581856 she really is a fresh breath of air from all the queens who have nothing better to do than bicker and fire off diatribes against other posters
581857 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
581858 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
581859 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
581860 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
581861 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
581862 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
581863 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
581864 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
581865 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
581866 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
581867 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
581868 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
581869 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
581870 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
581871 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
581872 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
581873 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
581874 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
581875 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
581876 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
581877 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
581878 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
581879 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
581880 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
581881 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
581882 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
581883 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
581884 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
581885 satsar p s songsb sta tror fortfarande jag kan prestera bra
581886 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
581887 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
581888 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
581889 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
581890 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
581891 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
581892 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
581893 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
581894 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
581895 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
581896 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
581897 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
581898 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
581899 decir que la llamaban 15 veces al d a es poco incluso a la una de la ma ana le preguntaban d nde estaba muchas veces se les encontraba en la esquina de la casa controlando a mi hija y dici ndole c mo se ten a que vestir es decir la acosaban demasiado

581918 il pd rischia una condizione stabilmente minoritaria per uscirne dobbiamo scontentare qualcuno e andare a prendere voti a destra sui temi della vita e della tecnica serve un nuovo umanesimo
581919 se il pd non vuole ritrovarsi nei prossimi anni in una condizione stabilmente minoritaria deve mettere in discussione assunti considerati intoccabili definendo la propria identit e la propria agenda con coraggio
581920 sulla nostra agenda gli italiani devono discutere litigare se necessario
581921 su questi temi siamo troppo sbrigativi certo pi facile staccare la spina si fa prima molto pi complicato doloroso e faticoso invece gestire e assicurare unassistenza continua ai malati affrontare problemi spinosi e confrontarsi con la sofferenza durante la vita e anche alsuo punto estremo senza facili scorciatoie
581922 i voti che mi sono mancati afferma erano in parte quelli della sinistra radicale sia come conseguenza del tracollo della sinistra arcobaleno sia per lostilit verso un candidato visto come troppo moderato e in parte erano i voti dellarea dipietrista direi persino indipendentemente dalla volont dei dirigenti
581923 nei prossimi anni avremo una radicalizzazione a sinistra con rifondazione comunista e le altre forze che si metteranno in competizione in quellarea che per un tempo non breve sembrano decise a disinteressarsi di una prospettiva di governo e con unaltra componente litalia dei valori quella cio che abbiamo scelto come nostro unico alleato che sembra interessatissima a collocarsi in una posizione concorrenziale con il pd
581924 tutto questo ci dice che i voti ce li dobbiamo andare a prendere nel vasto pelago del popolo che ha votato centrodestra
581925 ora si tratta di definire lidentit e lagenda del pd le alleanze vengono dopo
581926 in tutti i paesi europei sono gi pronte le liste dei candidati mettere mano adesso al sistema di voto senza unintesa larghissima sarebbe surreale
581927 e certo non aiuta la scadenza del referendum elettorale che in realt non altro che la convalida e la radicalizzazione dellattuale legge calderoli e che considero parte di questo contesto tuttaltro che entusiasmante da cui dovremmo uscire perenni dibattiti metodologici su dialogo s dialogo no dialogo forse
581928 una dimensione ormai antropologica dellitalia contemporanea un processo del luned che dura 365 giorni lanno un berciare ininterrotto che in realt non fa che alimentare linefficienza delle amministrazioni pubbliche e una cultura della denigrazione cui ci dobbiamo sottrarre
581929 se si costruisce un centro congressi nel molise o un aeroporto in umbria noi dobbiamo dire bene la reazione non pu essere sempre qualsiasi cosa si faccia cosa c sotto
581930 per evitare polemiche generalizzate sulla casta sostiene rutelli lantidoto sta in un principio di accountability per ogni uomo pubblico che sia parlamentare assessore o presidente di unauthority
581931 la soluzione non pu essere invece litalia del non fare nulla che esattamente il risultato cui porta questo continuo processo del luned contro chiunque cerchi di amministrare e realizzare
581932 noi dobbiamo dimostrare insiste rutelli che il pd non una delle vecchie case ripittate non la prosecuzione dellesperienza di questi quindici anni con un altro nome e per farlo dobbiamo anzitutto uscire dagli stereotipi
581933 coloro cui si offre unintegrazione devono volerla e parteciparvi lintegrazione non un principio astratto non basta una bella dichiarazione e un esercizio faticoso che esige reciprocit anche su questo nel pd dobbiamo fare una discussione pi coraggiosa sapendo che il successo della destra sui temi della sicurezza affonda qui le sue radici nella percezione profonda da parte dei cittadini della difficolt e anche di alcune impossibilit penso al fanatismo islamista dellintegrazione
581934 allorigine di tanti episodi di violenza urbana c un problema gigantesco che riguarda ormai unintera generazione il problema il salto di qualit che c stato tra i giovanissimi oggi addirittura tra chi ha undici o dodici anni nelluso delle sostanze psicotrope e non possiamo affrontarlo con la solita guerricciola tra proibizionisti e antiproibizionisti perch qui non si tratta pi di uno spinello con gli amici ma dellinterazione sempre pi frequente tra alcol spinelli che peraltro sono ormai quindici volte pi potenti di quelli di ventanni fa e la pasticca che si compra a dieci euro in discoteca unintera generazione ci dicono gli studiosi rischia di andare verso la schizofrenia e perch mai la sinistra non dovrebbe occuparsene
581935 quando ho detto in una riunione che negli ospedali c chi accelera la morte di anziani rimasti soli per appropriarsi dei loro effetti personali dal fondo della sala una voce mi ha replicato che magari lo fanno per liberare i letti per poter curare altre persone non mi sembra una risposta come dire allaltezza del problema
581936 confrontarsi in modo non convenzionale sullimpatto della scienza e della tecnica sulle nostre vite
581937 costruire un nuovo umanesimo per il xxi secolo non pi la rielaborazione delle culture socialista liberale e cattolico democratica del secolo scorso sui diritti delluomo

582018 having listened to claim on this show this week which you are rightly skeptical about that alcohol had caused more deaths than all the wars together i thought i do a bit of research beginning with the revolutionary war there have been about 1 542 897 us deaths attributed to war counting the most up to date numbers in iraq right now in 2005 the number of deaths attributed to drunk driving was only 16 855 according to the cdc they only way that deaths attributed to drunk driving could be as high as us war casualties would be if this rate was held for the last 100 years which obviously it hasnt given that cars 100 year werent exactly what they are today not to mention the fact that the population has grown dramatically so all in all the numbers are probably closer than they should be but wars went out mostly because theyve been around longer love the show keep up the good work

582035 we demand the best for our children even if you dont
582036 we need an extended teachable moment in our schools collective efforts on the part of educators parents and social justice activists to expose and eliminate these silences in our curriculum and teaching on the national level we need courageous leaders willing to put the issue of race on the table along with the equally difficult topic of american empire it is only when we begin to address both issues at a societal level that real change will come to our schools

582038 a few years ago i served as an expert witness and consultant in a discrimination lawsuit against a school district in washington state
582039 information of this attack was shared very late with pakistan this was a case where the us did not want to alert the pakistanis in advance because of concerns over information leaks
582040 it s just a first date prescribes that you play to win that means that even though a first date isn t a big deal you should still be on your game and try

582042 there s almost twice as much turbulence experienced in the winter months than in summer over greenland
582043 the pacific route between australia and the us is another hotspot for turbulence that occurs almost all year round
582044 the us is terrible in the northern summertime because of storms
582045 about a dozen in flight turbulence injuries are reported in australia each year to the atsb and many more go unreported some of these injuries are serious and have resulted in broken bones and head injuries
582046 most commercial aircraft have on board weather radars so they typically avoid the main parts of the thunderstorm however turbulence can occur in regions where the radar is not seeing much but where there is visible cloud
582047 turbulence can also occur in the clear air on the sides and above rising thunderstorms and this seems to be a source of some very severe encounters especially at night when the pilot does not have any visual clues

582052 they are so arrogant as to think that they do not have to answer to anyone when they take our tax money every month and took our votes last november
582053 the fact that we as parents are forced to do armstrong morton and the boards job in order to protect our children shows that these people need to go
582054 if a teacher pisses morton off then she will be removed within days if a teacher throws a video tape at a retarded child or comes to work drunk in front of students or is abusive to female teachers then for morton and those board members he is not an urgent issue because he is not a threat to them they are really pathetic people like everyone says pathetic people that dont give a rats ass about my son or your daughter so how can we support them when they would rather let our kids be in the same building with a violent man how are they helping us
582055 this is totally baseless the claim is rubbish there is no truth in this
582056 baitullah did not write any letter to anybody he never asked for any help or assistance

582078 as soon as i heard what they were planning i really wanted to be a part of it
582079 i put together several proposals but when editor rachel meisel finally called me she started out by saying that they werent going to be publishing any of them

582085 i got the idea last year while shopping for a sympathy card with my wife
582086 i asked my wife why she was buying two cards when we only needed one and she explained to me that she did not know what to write inside of her card of choice so she was going to hand write the message from one card into the other i decided that evening to do a google search for sympathy card messages and discovered that i could only find floral shops offering some sympathy messages but no site specifically dedicated to providing various types of greeting card messages
582087 many people have busy lifestyles and demanding responsibilities that take up a lot of their time but this does not have to be a reason to neglect showing someone what they truly mean to you regardless of whether you need a creative card message words of comfort for a sympathy card thank you note examples graduation or other congratulation messages or even if you are looking for holiday christmas poems giftcardmessages com has it all although there are countless choices of greeting and e card services often the messages are ineffective impersonal and or inappropriate there are other sites that offer personalized greeting cards however many users lack the creativeness to materialize their feelings into effective verses giftcardmessages com seeks to alleviate unnecessary frustration by providing just the right words to communicate that special message for any occasion

582161 in order to get anything banned in trans d tropin protein and essential fatty acids would have to be banned until any organization can dictate what type of food a person must eat they will not be able to prevent anyone from using trans d tropin lastly since trans d tropin increases endogenous hgh within physiological parameters there is no method available to test for trans d tropin use

582163 if there was security in the south why would we come here
582164 we will stay here even for 10 years until the bombardment ends
582165 there were armored vehicles on the hill and they were firing there was a heavy bombardment and planes bombed too
582166 they did not differentiate between the guilty and not guilty
582167 when the napalm hit our village many people were still sleeping in their homes
582168 those who survived the flames ran to the tidal flats we were trying to show the american pilots that we were civilians but they strafed us women and children
582169 we should not ignore or conceal the deaths of unarmed civilians that resulted not from the mistakes of a few soldiers but from systematic aerial bombing and strafing
582170 history teaches us that we need an alliance but that alliance should be based on humanitarian principles
582171 we consider macarthur a hero to our country but no one can know the suffering our family endured
582172 i too came to know about it this morning on television
582173 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent
582174 the fact that we have young people over there who have u s passports is of tremendous concern because of their ability to come back into the united states
582175 we have previously said that increased activity in the pakistani tribal areas gives us some reason for concern
582176 we have also previously talked about our concerns that al qaida is seeking to recruit western looking sympathizers with no criminal records who could more easily blend in and attempt to travel to the united states
582177 no credible information at this time to suggest an imminent threat to the homeland or u s interests at the olympics
582178 i understand there is a problem of extremism at some madrassas
582179 but to put everyone under this broad net of suspicion is beginning to infringe on peoples civil liberties
582180 michael mccauls failed publicity stunt shows it is past time for new leadership in texas 10th congressional district
582181 a nice sound bite that trivializes a very serious issue for this country
582182 our objective is to get more medals than anybody thats what competition is about
582183 im confident that by showing respect to the people to the olympics it will put me in a position to continue to have frank and candid discussions
582184 this is an enormous show of face gesture of face from the president to actually go to the olympics
582185 this is chinas international coming out party in many respects the olympics so its an enormous thing
582186 if this man is going as the leader of the free world to one of the most notorious rights abusing regimes in the world and he spends the whole afternoon watching water polo what does that say about where the united states priorities lie
582187 he said he didnt have the time personnel or the necessary equipment
582188 even when his boss ordered him to go ahead with the test he refused
582189 in mexico aids patients face two deaths one physical one social
582190 its a terrible shame that despite having medicine to detain the physical death in mexico and many parts of the world we must still endure a social death
582191 in mexico not all men who have sex with men consider themselves gay so they arent being reached by gay outreach organizations
582192 there is a whole cultural identity and stigma around the disease
582193 hiv and aids reproduce in a brutal way the stigmas and discrimination that are already present in mexican society
582194 and the doctor sent me away saying i was faking it
582195 but i knew if i was rude theyd even be less likely to help me
582196 im fighting for all the patients because this could happen to them tomorrow
582197 for the government and the decision makers were the scum of society
582198 so to spend money on us brings them little political benefit
582199 and that if you let it grow there will be a huge cost for the country
582200 these jellyfish near shore are a message the sea is sending us saying look how badly you are treating me
582201 we need to take care of it for our tourism industry but the big problem is not on the beach its whats happening in the seas
582202 human caused stresses including global warming and overfishing are encouraging jellyfish surpluses in many tourist destinations and productive fisheries
582203 in the past few years the dynamic has changed completely the temperature is a little warmer
582204 these cultural and sport personalities are examples of honoring the islamic republic of iran
582205 they should promote the spirit of gallantry and not the culture of consumerism
582206 i think a lot about what happened there as a mother im pained by everything thats happened
582207 the physical places are an important part of that history they keep the history alive when youre in these sites you are living that history
582208 human rights has to be a reality in this country and not just something we do for our external image
582209 our plan would involve practically all the police stations and military regiments in the country which could get uncomfortable
582210 but that would be a meaningful step because it would show the whole government was involved in the abuses
582211 its a little expensive for cubans but once a year you can afford to have this kind of fun
582212 the government is squeezing us i dont have time to read or think its a catastrophe its torture really i feel schizophrenic without books and thoughts but were kept too busy just surviving we dont have time to think
582213 nasser let us believe that we could push israel into the sea he made us believe that we were a great nation
582214 but it all turned out to be a big lie
582215 you know it wasnt the information age back then you had to read a lot of books just to get a tiny bit of detail
582216 he has divided society between rich and poor this is the worst era of all it wont get any worse mubarak has kept us so distracted by trying to earn a living that we have time or energy for nothing else weve lost a younger generation of leftists
582217 when i used to run from the police id take my books with me
582218 if i didnt the police would come into my flat and confiscate them
582219 we want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents
582220 we need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances
582221 my boss complained to me about my work i wanted to cause trouble for him by stabbing somebody
582222 ive been feeling frustrated because i cant find a job
582223 my supervisor scolded me at work i wanted to vent my resentment by stabbing someone the target could have been anybody
582224 i stabbed him because of my frustration it could have been anybody
582225 individualism is spreading in japanese society so the number of young people who feel they are isolated from society is increasing many people feel that the competitiveness of japanese society has made them outsiders i believe thats the reason behind the incidents
582226 i believe the akihabara rampage was a trigger for these recent stabbing incidents
582227 from about 2000 the british government established a system to support such young people their system included a program in which specialists counseled troubled youths so they wouldnt feel isolated from society such measures dont show short term results but now we are in a period where we need to prepare similar measures based on a long term perspective
582228 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease
582229 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
582230 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
582231 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact
582232 hiv aids continues to be a public health emergency that has not received adequate nor appropriate attention as a nationwide priority
582233 to make measurable progress against hiv we need to know whether infection rates are going up which groups are becoming infected and which prevention activities reduce new infections
582234 we need a comprehensive national aids strategy with measurable outcome targets a timeline for action increased funding and a particular focus on those most at risk including racial and ethnic minorities
582235 we were told if we didnt want to be his wife we would be killed i was 15 years old by then
582236 when we were in world vision we were told each and every day that people have different attitudes
582237 even where i am now there are a lot of things people say but some of them dont even know that i was once in the bush but i dont mind
582238 some of the things i hear people say is that they dont want to see or be near someone from the bush like me
582239 but for us who have come back from the bush we know that it can happen to anybody the same way it happened to us
582240 get rid of the anytime soon and i would say encouraged
582241 it could be a blessing it could be a curse
582242 please be advised that the united states attorney for the western district of virginia has closed its criminal investigation file in this case
582243 bowens office has been roiled by allegations of overspending and mismanagement
582244 threatened to put hexes on employees and made inappropriate sexual remarks in the presence of staff members
582245 was all about anonymous allegations that have been found to be without merit and dismissed
582246 i would say im glad the system worked in this case that it reached the right result in finding these anonymous allegations to be specious and im glad that our organization continued to produce good work while this cloud hung over our head im glad its been removed and im glad that the integrity of the organization and of me personally has been substantiated through the process
582247 anti corruption efforts in iraq u s and iraq take action but much remains to be done
582248 this leaves future program investments vulnerable to wasteful spending ineffectiveness and inefficiency
582249 moreover intimidation and threats continue to impede effective anti corruption efforts and current iraqi regulations continue to have a corrosive effect on the perception of iraqi commitment to aggressively address corruption
582250 he told me about a defendant he tried and convicted sentenced him to four years
582251 the judge said what are you going out in the streets
582252 we have a large group of rich people who are moving to this poor environment
582253 the people around them are still very poor they are very angry
582254 there is a group of people who are sore at us we didnt buy their houses for 3 million or 5 million
582255 they have this feeling that if they keep complaining all the time then ill have to buy them out to get rid of this headache
582256 bse 14 350 is the nearest support upside target is 14 786 and 15 150
582257 after crossing bse 15 000 there is a possibility of a rally in strong midcap stocks
582258 cyberbullying is much worse because you cannot see the bully and its a 24 7 thing you cant get away from it
582259 schools are struggling with this issue because youre dealing with a students private space but they know they cant just ignore cyberbullying
582260 we are seeing school systems address this problem in various educational programs and those will continue to grow in number and in content
582261 it is not required under the rules that the premier should meet the president every time he embarks on or comes back from a foreign visit
582262 its true that i never saw the fox i met that day again so that encounter is a turning point for a story which for me had ended
582263 but on top of that ive added the whole of my experience from my career and put it in this film especially in the ending and the conclusion that grown ups can appreciate
582264 the story was a fiction and called for a feature film so it was not specifically a desire to do fiction but to tell this story when you make a documentary you and the narrator are often frustrated because youre limited and have to deal with what you have
582265 in this case i wanted to give myself the means to tell exactly what i wanted while keeping the energy and the authenticity of documentary making
582266 the need for reform or the pelagian captivity of the church
582267 i find calvinist such as yourself very entertaining on one hand you write a post asking whats up with all this pelagianism in the church and that something needs to be done about it ok then sir put your theology where your mouth is stop blithering about it in a public forum and start confronting the one who is really responsible for all this god since man is unable to do anything from a freewill standpoint but is predestined or foreordained to do everything then god is the person you need to take issue with
582268 all that the father gives me will come to me and whoever comes to me i will never cast out for i have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me and this is the will of him who sent me that i should lose nothing of all that he has given me but raise it up on the last day for this is the will of my father that everyone who looks on the son and believes in him should have eternal life and i will raise him up on the last day
582269 all xs come to jesus and are raised to the resurrection of life
582270 if you truly adhered to predestination then you would realize that its god fault for all this and not any one else
582271 but alas there is the rub in your own mind you believe that man does have a choice and does have a freewill if you didnt then why all this complaining you seem to act as if we have a choice here but according to your theology we really dont
582272 i want to believe in jesus but god wont let me
582273 the issue the rest of us have with calvinism is that your theology does makes god out to be a monster because god is somehow more concerned with his power and sovereignty than about love
582274 you see the issue most people have is that calvinism grossly violates mans god given sense of natural law or right reason whenever this is violated then this is a good sign something is not truth but a lie i e calvinism
582275 why do calvinist have a problem with god setting aside his knowledge or power so that he may love or better yet allow man to love him god is not some power hungry deity as calvin made him out to be besides who made the rule or where is it found in the bible that if god is not totally in control he is somehow not god let me clue you in there isnt
582276 all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing and he does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say to him
582277 open theism is not a pagan philosophy but rather predestination and original sin are the seed of paganism calvinism has its roots from is augustine prior to him the only place most of the 5 points of calvinism were found were in gnosticism and pagan philosophy
582278 besides sir you are so severly blinded by calvinsim that my rambling here will do little to prick your mind or your heart about what you have said about open theist or the so called heresy of pelgianism whatever that means good luck in your search for truth i just hope god manipulates your brain to find it

582285 is like were putting money in the bank for later
582286 i think competition makes us all better so those two guys will compete for the job
582287 but well have a starter before the first game right now i dont see this quarterback being a rotational deal
582288 ive been working with coach holgorsen on a lot of things like footwork and throws
582289 i had to learn to slow down and not try to do everything 100 miles per hour
582290 its one of those deals where you know it when you see it more than anything
582291 you look for guys who can handle pressure who can throw accurate balls who have the intangibles and can lead a team
582292 arm strength footwork theres a whole list of things that you know are important and they have to possess them the more of those traits they possess then the better off youre going to be
582293 its just going to be who is able to manage the situation and be productive during two a days
582294 guys who can play football rather than just execute drills thats what im interested in seeing
582295 i think the good thing is that both of them are capable of being conference champions i think we can win with either one of them
582296 they have two different styles but the bottom line is being able to move the ball
582297 they have to keep the offense on the field and score touchdowns and theyre both able to do that
582298 i feel that we have two quality guys and we just have to evaluate them in the fall and see whos improved over the summer the good thing is that theyre both good so i dont think we can make a bad decision
582299 but the bottom line is that one of them is going to be happy and one of them is going to be angry

582304 you mad skippy im fat i would say this photo is me but that wouldnt be fair the whale isnt that big
582305 we just wanted an hour without someones eyes rolling someone stomping their feet someone asking why for the 50th time an hour of just grownup time even if it meant wed spend it talking about the three creatures that had just about driven us over the edge for the third time that day
582306 then i remembered something my dad had done i had to up the stakes a bit given that kids roll their eyes at pennies these days but i figured it was worth a shot i dug into the change jar on the dresser fished out exactly how many quarters i needed and then called the kids into the bedroom
582307 as i opened the window and pushed the screen out of the way i told them that i had ten dollars in quarters
582308 man they scrambled the wife and i sat down at the kitchen table with cold drinks and watched through the patio door all three were on their hands and knees although the 12 year old mostly sat there and directly his brother and sister to shiny spots he was sure hed just noticed
582309 still an hour and a half later they came back in and the youngest had tears in his eyes
582310 now i waited for the its not fair crying to start but the girl and the younger boy both started apologizing for losing one of dads quarters
582311 the younger two ran off to wash up and the 12 year old god help us hes already almost 6 feet tall watched them leave then said you know grandpa told me that he used to throw ninety nine pennies out the window and tell you not to come back inside until you found one hundred of them
582312 he hasnt threatened to let his siblings in on it but i did notice the thirty bucks i intended to let them spend on video games inched up to over sixty and he ate an entire medium pizza by himself the little shit has something on me
582313 this is my legal partner this is who i file joint income tax with and who i can finally get on my insurance policy
582314 this is the person that holds my heart in their hands this is the person i want to sometimes take for granted and for whom i always want to be there this is the person for whom i would swallow molten lead if it meant they would get to dance on the edge of forever and feel nothing but happiness
582315 i dont have any cash but if youre hungry i just bought some food
582316 siren blood curse sonys horror game split up into 12 episodes is the scariest game of 2008
582317 very hot when we asked them for more information bush laughed and said when we share information with your guys the bad guys always run away
582318 the question is why its taken the americans so long to see what the isi is doing
582319 weve been telling them for years but they wouldnt buy it
582320 there is no involvement by the isi of any form in afghanistan
582321 the security of pakistan afghanistan the entire region and maybe that of the whole world will be determined by developments in the tribal areas over the next few months
582322 the indian embassy bombing seems to have finally provided it this is the smoking gun weve all been looking for
582323 what we were trying to do was bring national security and the war on terror under the interior ministry but it was wrongly announced
582324 they said they were still waiting for a signal to act in the tribal areas to be honest none of us could think of a thing they had done in six months
582325 we need to identify these people and weed them out
582326 it was the first thing i read on my blackberry when i got off the plane
582327 we seem often to be threatening death to each other not offering life
582328 we need to speak life to each other and that means change
582329 we are requesting the media and the public for privacy
582330 on the honesty and the loyalty of the current security force in kirkuk
582331 marginalize any other ethnic group control kirkuk and annex it to kurdistan
582332 the kurds want to lay bricks for an independent state but escalating tensions will not bring any good to anyone
582333 now appears to be a degree of durability in gains
582334 i think it takes away what obama considers to be an issue that works in his favor and also puts the focus more on the economy and energy prices where he wants to increase taxes during a recession and doesnt really have a plan to bring us to energy independence
582335 the more success we have in iraq and the more that casualties are down and the more troops were able to bring home the more it is a vindication of the surge strategy advocated by john mccain
582336 obviously you could say it helps obama in that his withdrawal timeline no longer appears so out of whack it also helps him with centrist voters and thus makes it harder for republicans to portray him as not ready to be commander in chief
582337 but i still dont like his withdrawal plan because it is rigid and still too fast
582338 on the other hand mr bushs pending withdrawal plans would increasingly demonstrate the surge has been a huge success and thus arguably worrisome that obama does not understand the war we are fighting very well and is not ready to be commander in chief
582339 my granddaughter said the explosion occurred when someone turned the lights on
582340 a strong whistling sound came up from the ground floor
582341 five minutes later a strong gas smell took over the dormitories followed by the deafening explosion we felt the flames rise up around us
582342 will not give up a single iota of its nuclear rights
582343 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges
582344 seriously seeking to increase the size of joint investments to more than 3 billion over the next years
582345 i personally believe that us americans like obama because he wants to give us maps and end the war in the iraq and in like such as south africa and the iraq because people over here should help the obama should help mccain for everywhere like such as
582346 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has
582347 in fact he has done more than we could have hoped for
582348 almost one third of german teen agers polled said they didnt know what the word auschwitz stands for
582349 i never contacted the red sox after the deal was made
582350 both parties agreed that it was in the best interest of everyone involved for manny to move forward
582351 from my point of view in dealing with the red sox they did things in a forthright manner
582352 i extended myself a little more friday because i was trying to beat out a hit
582353 when i slow down is when i feel it grabbing not so much when im running it doesnt let me extend normally
582354 thats why were going to talk to the doctor and see what he wants to do maybe with a supersonic anti inflammatory it will come down
582355 weve tried heat stretch stim ultrasound massage i got a cortisone shot before the all star break weve kind of exhausted everything i dont know its just a nagging thing that hasnt gone away
582356 thankfully its not a major aspect of the game for me
582357 im not that fast to start so i really feel slow
582358 hes getting used to la hell do fine out there he can hit anywhere
582359 the ball was coming out of his hand on a downward plane with velocity that was good

582369 he was able to take away our athleticism and we were really in trouble
582370 we were really struggling to make anything happen in the first part of the second half
582371 we switched our formation from a 4 4 2 to a 3 4 3 to try and get some energy up top
582372 our depth was a huge reason why we won this game
582373 our bench gave us the energy we needed and helped put us on top
582374 to have the game in our hands to be able to see the trophy right in front of us this just hurts a lot
582375 with the 1 0 goal lead we played a little bit safer but the momentum swing at the end of the game was too much to overcome

582426 it is not good that you go to the place of the yam ko desh
582427 there are fully 600 mounds still to be seen in the state and at least 500 more must have been destroyed within the last 150 years the enclosures usually known as indian forts but probably having no connection with military usage are also vanishihng rapidly it is the duty of the state to locate measure photograph and chart these structures before they disappear entirely
582428 they have proven to be burial sites arising perhaps from an ancient custom of the canadian hurons who thus met to honor the bones of their dead every 10 or 15 years
582429 generally a number of skeletons in various positions have been found and with them arrow and spear heads stone tools pottery vessels and in the upper strata iron copper and brass kettles glass beads and now and then silver crosses indicating the visit of a catholic missionary
582430 numerous indian bodies were exhumed in 1870 many arrow heads of course were overlooked and i was lucky enough to be on the ground not so long ago when such remains still rewarded the patient seeker
582431 one early witness tells how the red men used to try to fool the spirits of the departed
582432 the object of this custom was that the spirit might not be able to follow their track in the sand according to the current superstition the soul of the deceased lingered for several days unwilling to quit his earthly belongings as a ghost cannot cross water the ruse resorted to get the spirit out of touch with his freinds and he hereupon gave up his intention of staying near his familiar scenes and companions and started off for the happy hunting grounds
582433 it is really astounding how little we know of the many peoples and cultures which the coming of the white men have caused to vanish in indian mounds in forts or enclosures in the old pits and on ancient camping sites we find many a relic for which the archaeologist had no classificaiton and the use of which he is ignorant when in doubt we take refuge in the term ceremonial and express the belief that the arcicle of carving had something to do with the religious ovservance of the tribe
582434 is plainly the figure of a man with a drawn bow but what does it mean
582435 how long the indians had been in america before the arrival of columbus and how they got here is one of the great puzzles that confronts us

582447 there is absolutely no truth to any of the rumors
582448 outstanding dancer and a very sweet girl but thats about it
582449 i have four boxes one for each kit i bought
582450 well theyre not included you know so i have to charge for those
582451 really because on the package here it says pointing kit includes bullet point 1 foam pouch thingys bullet point 2 box insert forms bullet point 3 box
582452 yeah i know thats what it says but the box isnt included
582453 im sorry but i really believe the box is included so i need you to ask someone else about this
582454 pode deixar v j t passando a gente vai at o ponto brigada
582455 so ma how is it here are they treating you all right
582456 lying on the living room floor partially clothed with a plastic bag over her head
582457 as is the case sometimes there were complicating circumstances which prevent us from meeting the requirements of the statutes he was charged under
582458 proving any charge other than hit and run beyond reasonable doubt would have been difficult
582459 on behalf of the entire family we are very disappointed and very frustrated
582460 i understand that this was an accident but he left the scene of that accident and that killed my cousin
582461 the prosecutor did the best he could and we appreciate that but the laws need to be changed if his sentence is only a year
582462 when something like this happens you think oh hes in deep trouble but this is not deep trouble fifteen years is deep trouble
582463 for decades ed woods movie plan 9 from outer space has reigned supreme as the most brilliantly awful movie ever made
582464 when you can take the fire from my hand it will be time for your to leave
582465 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
582466 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
582467 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
582468 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
582469 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
582470 when i was 22 i was a different guy so im not trying to spin anything
582471 you spend two hours with somebody and now you know them thats not the case
582472 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what the repercussions are from this event
582473 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here
582474 he got knocked down but he got right back up and went even harder and in omaha it showed
582475 he is the best in the world he is mr backstroke and if you start thinking that hes not or somebody tells him that hes not then hell prove it over and over and over again that he is
582476 i dont know where i sit in the history of the sport the way i look at it i just need to keep doing what ive been doing year in and year out im not worried about whether im the best backstroker of all time thats not something i think about im more focused on the goals ive set for myself
582477 his personality in public seems to be a devil may care surfer dude hey everythings cool and groovy but inside he has the heart of a competitor
582478 and the difference between great swimmers and champion swimmers is great swimmers love to win champions hate to lose fear of failure is stronger than the joy of victory
582479 was pretty much set in stone after the 100 backstroke my olympics was very much so downhill
582480 for me it was if i win the 100 im probably going to win three gold medals with this one im going to have to be on my toes the whole time
582481 there were some rough days when we got back to austin
582482 then i realized those things arent anybodys to keep theyre just on loan world records kind of let reality sink in and moved on
582483 ive always trained to win on my worst day but apparently my worst day is not good enough to win anymore
582484 what any swimmer wants what any athlete wants is to have that one particular race or game and claim your career on that one day
582485 you can say this is what i swam for if i were to go 1 51 during the olympics i could just go to the press conference and hang up my towel because i wouldnt need to swim any more
582486 theres some cute girls on this u s olympics team
582487 a bit of a reality check might be good for the guys bring us back down to earth
582488 the work ethic within the group has been great and we prepared well for this game so i think it just reinforces how tough it is to win away from home and i think we need that heading to south africa
582489 we were confident whether we were over confident i dont know
582490 we get a couple of days off now hopefully get the niggles bumps and bruises out of the way and i guess get away from footy because its been pretty full on over the last couple of weeks and get a bit of balance going on
582491 the whole experience wasnt pleasant but the key for us is to make it a piece of growth
582492 you dont see too many roads without bends in them
582493 to be honest i think we tend to put our own barriers in front of ourselves that arent necessarily there
582494 most barriers in this game are self imposed its what you think of it if you think winning away from homes tough then its tough
582495 oh no that would mean id get water in the hole i want a dry hole
582496 im leaving tomorrow were getting on a plane to virginia
582497 we like misty oak lane the best weve lived in three places misty oak lane is the best because its near my school and its a very good neighborhood we have friends there and i play in my cousins pool
582498 sorry george but youre telling such a good story i cant help it
582499 oh youre right its your life seems like its a pretty good life huh
582500 me too well george of misty oak lane it was great talking to you have a great trip to virginia and listen to what your mommom says while youre visiting hope you get to come back soon
582501 oh i will were coming back august fifteenth im trying to find buried treasure
582502 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
582503 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
582504 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
582505 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
582506 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
582507 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
582508 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
582509 and we need and i need michael moore in my life

582528 for the last two months republicans have used every single tool available to us to allow this house to vote on expanding access to americas abundant diverse and currently locked away energy resources during that same time democratic leaders have used every single tool available to them to deny this house that opportunity theyve even gone as far as preventing rank and file democrats from working with republicans to bring forth commonsense bi partisan energy solutions for the american people today their goal was to adjourn the house as quickly as they could even as republicans stood by on the house floor prepared to debate the merits of producing new domestic energy for the american people instead democrats gaveled the day closed switched off the cameras turned off the lights cut the mics and ran for the exits but republicans remain on the floor right now ready willing and able to lead on the most important issue facing the american people but while democrats showed today that you can run from a debate on energy they wont be able to hide from it much longer its my hope that theyll come back in september chastened by their constituents and ready to work with republicans on tackling the energy crisis facing this nation
582529 i want to commend the house republicans for once again standing up for the needs of the american people while democrat members of congress were all too quick to cut out of town for the august recess today house republicans stood their ground this afternoon demanding the democrats address the need for more american energy and lower gas prices speaker nancy pelosi and her democrat members can expect to have their vacations interrupted by the resounding call of americans demanding relief at the pump and independence from foreign oil i applaud the efforts of the republican congressmen for putting americans needs ahead of their own demanding action from the democrat congress and revolting against politics as usual in washington
582530 just inflate your tires and get tune ups and we can save the same amount of oil as drilling
582531 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
582532 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
582533 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
582534 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
582535 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
582536 no i spent enough time thinking about and sweating over this to know that it is interesting the characters and themes spoke to me day after day week after week while i worked on the plot this is just a bad moment i should not scrap this idea and start with something new

582549 dynamics of world history is extraordinarily valuable because it is much more than a christopher dawson compendium or than an introduction to dawson it is a very carefully collected and edited quilt of dawsons most important writings a multicolored quilt rather than a collection of disparate essays it covers and comprises what it ought to cover and comprise and the richness and the quality of dawsons historical thinking will catch the eye of its readers at first sight

582577 a key effect of devaluation is that it makes the domestic currency cheaper relative to other currencies there are two implications of a devaluation first devaluation makes the countrys exports relatively less expensive for foreigners second the devaluation makes foreign products relatively more expensive for domestic consumers thus discouraging imports this may help to increase the countrys exports and decrease imports and may therefore help to reduce the current account deficit

582581 subprime lending also called b paper near prime or second chance lending is the practice of making loans to borrowers who do not qualify for the best market interest rates because of their deficient credit history the term also refers to paper taken on property that cannot be sold on the primary market including loans on certain types of investment properties and certain types of self employed individuals subprime lending is risky for both lenders and borrowers due to the combination of high interest rates poor credit history and adverse financial situations usually associated with subprime applicants
582582 when the rates were getting too low they switched to competing by way of advance ratio versus selling price
582583 in other words if lender a was offering 90 financing lender b would go to 100 financing then lender c would advance 100 of selling price plus costs then to 105 etc we have seen the u s equity lenders now go to 130 of selling price giving back 10 15 to the purchasers to help buy furniture large electronic products groceries while the remaining 15 20 was eaten up in fees

582586 a bank run is a type of financial crisis it is a panic which occurs when a large number of customers of a bank fear it is insolvent and withdraw their deposits
582587 the queues that formed outside northern rock the countrys fifth biggest mortgage lender represented the first bank run in britain since 1866 the panic was prompted by the very announcement designed to prevent it only when the bank of england said that it would stand by the stricken northern rock did depositors start to run for the exit attempts by alistair darling the chancellor of the exchequer to reassure savers served only to lengthen the queues of people outside branches demanding their money the run did not stop until mr darling gave a taxpayer backed guarantee on september 17th that for the time being all the existing deposits at northern rock were safe

582590 what do the wars in iraq and afghanistan and the economic recovery in the united states have in common more than one might expect to judge from the last couple of rounds of us growth figures 2004
582591 during the second quarter of 2003 when the war in iraq was in full swing some 60 per cent of the 3 3 per cent gdp growth rate was attributable to military spending
582592 the war has been a large part of the justification for the bush administration to run ever widening budget deficits and those deficits predicated largely on military spending have in turn pumped money into the economy and provided the stimulus that low interest rates and tax cuts on their own could never achieve
582593 these are the us governments own projections and we all know they have every incentive to accent the positive if this is the best they can do at this point then you know things are not just bad they are calamitous
582594 this glimpse at the future clearly shows that the debt of the us will in the foreseeable future go from being a troubling yet manageable fraction of the economy to being several times the size of economy that cant happen without serious repercussions
582595 the us government will be spending money they dont have which means creating more of it out of thin air and diluting the value of all the dollars that came before it doesnt take a harvard mba to know that the kind of deficits projected above guarantee a persistently weak dollar higher inflation and higher interest rates going forward
582596 the great depression ended as nations increased their production of war materials at the start of world war ii this increased production provided jobs and put large amounts of money back into circulation
582597 world war ii spending often required a conversion of plants designed for civilian good production into military factories and back again over the 9 year period substantially higher federal tax rates that were paid by the majority of households imposed much stronger fiscal drags on the benefits of the spending finally less of the military spending was earmarked for wages and use of locally produced inputs which reduced the direct stimulus to the local economy

582602 the president chooses one of the three candidates for the job his nominee must be approved by the homeland security and governmental affairs panel and then confirmed by the senate

582606 you realize very quickly he has a good idea what hes doing his feel for it is impressive
582607 he understands whats going on he knows how to catch
582608 thats the way he is hes going to live on the corners this guys one of the great pitchers of our era
582609 a couple of them were good pitches they put good swings on abreu and the one to a rod
582610 im so moved its been a long wait even if we have to wait for hours it is worthwhile
582611 the torch represents peace and harmony the olympic spirit will give us strength to rebuild
582612 theres a lot of glory in having the torch come here this is our way of showing our support
582613 this is my life now and i was eager to get back to it and i couldnt be happier
582614 next year you and i and everybody else will be freer and have more space to say what we believe to be the truth
582615 the lesson here is that this is what foreign policy ought to be about
582616 it was obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit on this flight
582617 on the plus side the flight of our first stage with the new merlin 1c engine that will be used in falcon 9 was picture perfect unfortunately a problem occurred with stage separation causing the stages to be held together

582625 the true forms of government are those in which the one or the few or the many govern with a view to the common interest
582626 the voice of the people is the voice of god
582627 god is near of you with you in you a sacred spirit has its seat in us it is the observer and keeper of our good deeds and our wrongdoings
582628 we had talked a lot about the power suit which had a hollywood influence we used ronald reagan because he took that sense of power and turned it into strength
582629 weve given him more money and even more importantly more time for him to work on the film wed like to find a common ground that represents spikes vision but still offers a film that really delivers for a broad based audience
582630 we obviously still have a challenge on our hands but i wouldnt call it a problem simply a challenge no one wants to turn this into a bland sanitized studio movie this is a very special piece of material and were just trying to get it right
582631 sometimes they work and sometimes they dont the jury is still out on this one but we remain confident that spike is going to figure things out and at the end of the day well have an artistically compelling movie
582632 facilities where americans and westerners are known to live or congregate especially hotels restaurants housing compounds places of worship and resort areas
582633 the smaller ones the best westerns for example are low profile already
582634 the british and the u s government recommend against going to mount ararat and other areas where the pkk kurdish separatist group is active
582635 a good level of indication is how worried the turks look
582636 give international visitors a practical one stop source of official and authentic info on the u s
582637 im predisposed to the portrait because at the root and core of what i do is the desire to connect communicate and collaborate with people
582638 we were just sitting around one day and a commercial came on for a sam adams home brewing contest we thought it might be a cool idea to try that
582639 it was so cool to drink something that you made
582640 after my ninth batch i was reading through a home brewing magazine i saw that a local club was sponsoring a contest i entered two bottles in my first competition i got first place for a russian imperial stout i was just looking for feedback i didnt expect to win
582641 i strive for control over every bit of the process but still keep it as hands on as possible
582642 up and at em rise and shine get that mattress off your backs
582643 mans mens quondam contentus per an informatio nunquam regius its exemplar amplitudo
582644 yeah well my sister killed my family and i still love her
582645 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
582646 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
582647 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
582648 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
582649 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
582650 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
582651 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
582652 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
582653 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
582654 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
582655 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
582656 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
582657 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
582658 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
582659 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
582660 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
582661 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
582662 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
582663 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
582664 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
582665 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
582666 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
582667 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
582668 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
582669 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
582670 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
582671 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
582672 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
582673 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
582674 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members
582675 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are

582689 i tried not to think of his winning streak and what his new ranking spot will be i tried just to focus on my game
582690 it was my intention to have a fast start and to step in and go for it and in the second set i just tried to stay with him
582691 ini bukanlah masalah berat absolutnya tapi tergantung berapa lama anda memegangnya
582692 jika saya memegangnya selama 1 menit tidak ada masalah jika saya memegangnya selama 1 jam lengan kanan saya akan sakit dan jika saya memegangnya selama 1 hari penuh mungkin anda harus memanggilkan ambulans untuk saya beratnya sebenarnya sama tapi semakin lama saya memegangnya maka bebannya akan semakin berat

582695 thats one thing you better get used to cathy once youre a housewife thats all youll ever be
582696 but you have infantalized your husband for forty five years and ridicule all his attempts to do things on his own in order to make yourself feel better that is why he does nothing now
582697 but mom you are so much more than a housewife you are intelligent crafty thrifty strong you listen well and support the people you love youre an artist your paintings hang in public and private places all over california and the nw you are a very experienced and loving gardener every corner of your home sparkles with attention and simple uncluttered beauty you take care of the things you love people furniture flower beds you give all of yourself to us you are much more than a housewife and i would be very proud of myself if i could accomplish just a fraction of what you do
582698 the scene was overwhelming and i cant explain the stench
582699 every room was filled with animals and they were in the beds and everywhere
582700 in the situations i have witnessed there is no divine intervention all we have is each other we create our own problems and it us up to us to solve them
582701 first of all it may be recalled that we have condemned this incident in the strongest terms
582702 against this background the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too there were also bombing incidents in pakistan subsequently but we have not pointed fingers at anyone as we believe in carrying out investigations before laying responsibility gilani said
582703 it is important that the blame game is avoided as both countries have an institutionalised counter terrorism mechanism which is working satisfactorily

582709 we need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances
582710 i think i will get a lot of momentum for my career out of the victory
582711 i also think it will get our sport a lot of publicity in hong kong and encourage more people to start playing
582712 i was just thinking i still have a chance so i didnt give up and i just relaxed
582713 i think because i had already made it to the final i didnt have anything to lose

582715 before and immediately after august 8 we will not see persistent heavy rainfall
582716 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
582717 it is impossible to tell at what time the rain will fall on august 8 but we cannot exclude that there will be periodic rain then
582718 normally a typhoon can affect an area for one or two days
582719 it would not have a long term effect but would only have an effect for a limited period
582720 everyone is saying it is one of my best performances

582722 the impact of oil prices on local economies is extremely big

582724 i will firmly take emergency measures for people who are seriously affected by abnormal oil prices
582725 not enough is done at the very top end of the tourist market
582726 everyone in bordeaux thinks people wait on bended knee for their wines but nowadays excellent wines are produced all over the world
582727 the oenotourism trend in bordeaux is more oriented towards volume agencies and hotels and restaurants catering to the very top end are harder to find
582728 in my view luxury tourism can only be tailor made for very small groups often of two people
582729 we have no limits really it is up to what people want
582730 americans are the avid wine lovers they are looking for discoveries to learn about different grapes and comparisons with californian wines they want to know the history
582731 the russians stay two or three days with a chauffeur and an interpreter and have very heavy tasting schedules
582732 there are more and more luxury clients but the competition is tough
582733 places like italy spain and portugal have made huge efforts we have lessons to learn
582734 a bit of a reality check might be good for the guys bring us back down to earth
582735 the work ethic within the group has been great and we prepared well for this game so i think it just reinforces how tough it is to win away from home and i think we need that heading to south africa
582736 we were confident whether we were over confident i dont know
582737 we get a couple of days off now hopefully get the niggles bumps and bruises out of the way and i guess get away from footy because its been pretty full on over the last couple of weeks and get a bit of balance going on
582738 the whole experience wasnt pleasant but the key for us is to make it a piece of growth
582739 you dont see too many roads without bends in them
582740 to be honest i think we tend to put our own barriers in front of ourselves that arent necessarily there
582741 most barriers in this game are self imposed its what you think of it if you think winning away from homes tough then its tough
582742 dont bug me and trust me i shall not bug you

582793 no me dejaron hablar con un abogado en 24 horas no me dijeron de qu se me acusaba
582794 estoy presa por mi trabajo profesional como cineasta por la informaci n que manejo por interactuar con activistas mapuches que luchan por lo que creen por entrevistar a personas de comunidades mapuches que han sido muy reprimidas y que no se atreven a decir nada porque s muchas cosas tan crueles que me llegan a enfermar el pueblo mapuche ha sido humillado ha sido perseguido he visto tanta gente aplastada emocionalmente siqui tricamente tanta gente que no se atreve a hablar por eso estoy presa

582809 in the same way that each of us has had to learn in growing up to resist the temptation of wishful thinking about ordinary things like lotteries so our species has had to learn in growing up that we are not playing a starring role in any sort of grand cosmic drama
582810 this type of authoritarianism i call it moral narcissism is the point of comparison
582811 those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities
582812 so if god had said that it is necessary to prevent homosexuals from copulating it is every humans responsibility to do so
582813 because it makes no sense for one to be coercive with respect to things about which one is ignorant
582814 it makes no sense for laws to be religiously derived
582815 rather i contend that in a country with constitutionally enshrined freedom of religion and its negative freedom from religion it makes no sense for laws to be religiously derived
582816 recognition of moral ignorance does not forbid formulation of moral opinion
582817 one need only remember the commandment addressing covetousness which lumps thy neighbors wife in with that same neighbors ox and ass
582818 my concern is not related to the specifics of the inequality but rather to the inequality itself you condemn islams mistreatment of women but when one looks at christianity it is quite clear that women and men are not treated as absolute equals
582819 this is not a clean break from the islamic misogyny you excoriate
582820 presumably when that verse was written god knew quite well that some of his followers would misuse it in the context of hysterical hunts for witches
582821 it is not even clear from the bible whether the creator of the universe is aware of
582822 the bible could have contained some brand new information about the natural order i have harped on this before primarily because i think the argument from mundanity is one of the strongest weapons in an atheists arsenal after all christians claim that the creator of the universe directly inspired the bible forget about einstein and hemingway forget about joyce and sagan this is the creator of the universe here and yet despite gods omniscient authorship the bible wallows in first century primitivism and yawn inducing mundanity as sam harris observed the bible does not contain a single sentence that could not have been written by a man or woman living in the first century there is nothing about the actual age or size of the universe there is nothing about the germ theory of disease earths vast geography is shrunk down to claustrophobically local levels it is not even clear from the bible whether the creator of the universe is aware of if the bibles alleged omniscience had been manifest that tome could have been meaningful evidence

582919 good evening like my opponent i want to thank everyone involved in bringing this debate about as well as all of you in the audience for your open minded interest and civility
582920 mr machiavelli presented a truncated materialist logic one diluted with non material assumptions and assertions but given the plethora of which describe human history as a product of lofty aspirations intelligent choices errors and misunderstandings rather than people acting upon their hard and fast socio economic interests i found it refreshing
582921 we homo sapiens have been around between 200 000 250 000 years and for all but the last 10 000 we lived in hunting and gathering tribes with 20 to 100 members depending upon the available food
582922 it was only a short 10 millenia ago that we finally began to progress from hunting and gathering to horticulture planting various crops together then to agriculture sowing and harvesting larger tracts of specific grains
582923 over the course of that critical 10 000 years the populations of our communities grew continually larger hunting and gathering tribes had 20 100 members their semi nomadic horticultural agricultural replacements had hundreds and the latter in turn were succeeded by stationary feudal societies whose populations sometimes numbered in the millions todays capitalist communities are bigger still the u s presently having three hundred million people
582924 for what portion of humanitys 200 000 year historical journey does mr machiavelli offer the last few hundred years characterized by the existence of principalities and nation states
582925 it would be hard to formulate a theory of our species social economic and political evolution more truncated than that
582926 mr machiavellis materialist logic is also badly diluted with idealist propositions
582927 however immediately thereafter he informed us he would have supported the united states during world war ii saying the u
582928 anyone whos studied world war ii knows that until 1943 hitler was more wildly popular with germans than either roosevelt or churchill was with their respective populations
582929 as for japan historians have also documented its peoples enthusiasm from a western perspective a manic enthusiasm for prime minister tojo and emperor hirohito
582930 when confronted with these material realities american sociologists often conclude the germans and japanese were duped or deluded into giving their leaders such unquestioning support but those are machiavelli would have limited his inquiry to disclosing the of wwii and the natural necessity of the roles played by each of the combatant nations refusing to take sides in a conflict that entailed the slaughter of over 70 million people
582931 now to anyone whos the least bit objective its obvious that the positive and negative cultural contributions of our species have never been preponderantly eastern or western or the exclusive offerings of particular states
582932 the german culture which graced the world with kant hegel schopenhauer nietzsche the aachen cathedral and the altes museum is the same german culture that cursed it with adolph hitler and hermann goering the holocaust the extermination of homosexuals and gypsies and the slave labor of millions of east europeans in national socialist factories
582933 the french culture that contributed descarte voltaire renoir jean jacques rousseau the eiffel tower sacre couer and notre dame is the same french culture which massacred 50 000 huguenots in a six weeks orgy of blood in 1572 its the french culture that killed arabs indiscriminately during algerias 8 year battle for independence torturing children in front of parents and parents in front of their children
582934 the italian culture of michelangelo and leonardo da vinci is the italian culture which produced pope gregory xiii who congratulated catherine de medici for exterminating the 50 000 calvinist huguenots ordered celebratory bonfires lighted and a gold medalion minted with the inscription slaughter of the huguenots its the italian culture that gave us both the brilliant galileo and the inquisition authorities who forced him to recant his heliocentric vision then put him under house arrest for the remainder of his life
582935 spains cultural offerings include goya velasquez dali picasso miguel de cervantes the iglesia de montserrat and botanical gardens along with the inquisitions torture racks and the cruelly oppressive 40 year regime of general francisco franco
582936 russian culture donated tchaikovsky rachmaninov dostoevsky anton chekov st basils cathedral and the cathedral of st michael the archangel it also furnished ivan the terrible and joseph stalin who rationalized and directed the killing of millions
582937 in addition to confucius lao tsu the compass paper printing gun powder the potala palace the great wall and the forbidden city chinas cultural contributions to humanity include general chiang kai shek who in observed that while reconquering the mainland would mean death for many millions it would be well worth the effort today chinese culture includes the use of brute force to suppress the rights of tibetans as well as millions of its own people
582938 then there was ancient greece called the fountainhead of western culture because it emphasized the use of reason and introduced our species to democracy ancient greece also waged centuries of bloody war over the control of land and its democracy which lived less than a hundred years was never available to women or slaves and almost every free family had slaves or even to freedmen
582939 as for hapless iraq in addition to saddam and chemical ali its cultural offerings go all the way back that momentous 10 000 years to the dawn of modern civilization
582940 on this occasion rumsfeld was at least being sincere as mr machiavelli documented making an omlet of iraq was what the u s was about
582941 where determining the role the neocons and the u s are playing in the mid east is concerned machiavelli did start with a observation
582942 common sense as well as all the available evidence indicates our ancestors also paid fealty and fought to defend their various pre national communities besides being equally objective the much simpler proposition that
582943 it accurately describes the practices of ancestral tribes and other pre national communities as well as those of the feudal and capitalist states with which my opponent seems so exclusively concerned
582944 the foremost objective of a leader who wishes to maintain his favored status must be the preservation of the community upon which a reproduction of his peoples social existences depends
582945 common sense and the historical record make it clear any leader who fails to accomplish that feat will be in serious trouble
582946 having reworded mr machiavellis central axioms to make them not just the behavior of people joined in national communities ill
582947 those of you unfamiliar with my theory may be surprised to hear i begin by agreeing with my conservative predecessor adam smith that we humans are driven by self interest
582948 its here that adam smiths thinking and my own diverge sharply
582949 smith described the populations of capitalist communities as engaged in trying to their socio economic conditions
582950 dont misunderstand me i am not denying given members of a community will strive to improve their socio economic situations my point is more fundamental
582951 it therefore follows that insofar as some individuals acquire more of the productive pie other members of the community must receive less and that will be creative of tension conflict enmity rather than amity between them
582952 which is why politicians always attempt to make pies bigger rather than give more to one social segment by taking from another its also why conservative legislators correctly accuse liberal colleagues who dare to suggest policies expropriative of the wealthy of engaging in the acquisitive efforts of particular individuals will be destructive not creative of community its members are somehow bound together in the here and now its obvious they are not being bound by the attempts of some to gain
582953 smith theorized theyre held together by an unseen hand i contend that for a materialist the nature of the hand is clear it is nothing other than the shared desire of every community member to reproduce his her social existence and as i will demonstrate it is the members of a community acting upon this shared material objective an objective assumed and unspoken which has driven our species forth
582954 when hunting and gathering tribes became too large to obtain adequate food in a given territory they initially did what bees and ants do intent on reproducing their primitive social existence some members of the tribe simply swarmed to a new location
582955 population growth and the desire to maintain social existence gradually led our earliest ancestors to inhabit remote regions of the earth adapting to different climates and different food sources as they moved
582956 eventually however with tribal populations continuing to increase and the amount of new habitable territory declining fighting began over the control of specific lands judging from the practices of tribes who presently inhabit tropical regions of asia africa and latin america our warring tribal ancestors used a variety of symbols tattoos feathers paints and animistic deities to identify themselves and their causes and to strengthen their resolve
582957 at various times in various locations reproducing social existence required tribes to turn their enemies into a source of protein their cannibalism was similarly justified made rational with elaborate beliefs ceremonies and incantations
582958 after hunting and gathering for 190 000 plus years our ancestors approached a critical juncture there were too many people for the earth to feed house and clothe if they continued using that order of production and distribution
582959 to succinctly describe the oxymoronic situation our hunting and gathering predecessors now faced their quest for a constancy of social existence would force them to radically change
582960 as war ceased to be the easiest way for hunters and gatherers to reproduce their social existence they began making slaves of enemies rather than killing them establishing nomadic slave communities domesticating animals and practicing rudimentary agriculture
582961 whereupon a territory which had provided for 20 100 hunters and gatherers could now sustain several times that number and do it at a significantly higher socio economic level providing better food clothing and shelter the problem of overpopulation and consequent violent struggle was momentarily relieved and our species social evolution at long last began
582962 und dort haben sie es the dialectical materialist nature of humanitys historical progress fundamental socio economic political changes have been the result of an assumed desire for no change under material circumstances which were themselves undergoing transformation principally though not exclusively because of an increase in population
582963 from hunting and gathering to nomadic slave to feudal and i believe to capitalist each succeeding order of production and distribution has been able to sustain a given number of people at a given socio economic level
582964 fortunately at the same time each has spawned then nurtured into adolesence a more cornucopian and flexible system which able to socio economically maintain the community and to heal the wounds its parent order had inflicted
582965 after the city of rome had been built and the surrounding countryside cultivated by its citizens the conditions of the community were different from what they had been before
582966 throughout much of temperate western europe our ancestors defensive formation of feudal productive orders was brought about by the equally defensive predations of scandinavian vikings in the 8
582967 they initially raided europes coastal regions in search of silver gold and slaves but central europes fertile land and warmer weather soon led them to establish villages and settle down further destabilizing the lives of those whose territories they invaded
582968 british historian william stubbs noted that for indigenous central europeans the
582969 within europes nascent feudal communities everyones life practices became rigidly but protectively defined control of the land was of prime importance serfs worked it with the kings sanction lords owned it but were above doing any physical work the lords were warriors whose principal function was to defend everyone including the monarch and the serfs against invasion
582970 in addition the lords were sworn to furnish adequate land firewood and housing materials for their serfs on their parts the serfs tasks included animal husbandry crop raising building and maintaining the monarchs and lords dwellings carrying their water making their clothing currying their horses and as the feudal productive order matured following the lords into battle
582971 all relationships between lords peasants religious authorities and kings were justified and sustained not by monetary exchanges or legal agreements but by enforced by each individuals sense of obligation barter this for that trade rather than currency controlled nearly every other movement of goods
582972 money lending for interest was considered usury and sinful on the part of borrowers as well as lenders behind it all stood the roman catholic church unified with the state formulating and propagating the appropriate philosophical rationales and pressuring recalcitrants to abide by their obligations lest they suffer punishment at the hand of god
582973 but like hunting and gathering and nomadic slave communities before them in time they started having difficulty maintaining the social existence of their increasing populations for a few hundred years again like their predecessors feudal principalities states eased the problem by warring with one another
582974 gradually however taking another progressive step and establishing the more cornucopian capitalist order of production became a
582975 while its possible that by reducing western europes population by one quarter to one half the bubonic plague
582976 historian fernand braudel argues the plague aggravated an economic recession which had started 50 years before
582977 recession was also making europes battles hence its armies grandscale that entailed using hired soldiers cast iron cannon and swords in ever larger quantities all of which likewise had to be paid for with money finally the recession prompted many lords to expand their landholdings in an effort to hang on that too required the use of legal tender
582978 in order to obtain the necessary funds lords had no alternative to borrowing from the inchoate financiers located in cities which meant usury would have to begin losing its feudal church dictated stigma land holding nobles further undermined their feudal productive orders by sending sons who were unable to acquire personal estates to the rapidly growing cities where they became financiers and merchants as well as engaging in handicraft and rudimentary industrial production makers and sellers of the swords cannon and uniforms the feudal elites so desperately needed
582979 confronting europeans with the material reality that religious devotion could no longer offer them protection economic recession and plague had also begun eroding the catholic churchs unquestioned authority
582980 purporting to be jesus earthly intermediary the feudal church had traditionally absolved individuals of their sins for confession and or good deeds such as aiding the poor
582981 but by the late 13th century feudalisms growing inability to sustain europes population was squeezing the clergy whose numbers were also increasing along with everyone else prompting the church to begin
582982 machiavelli described how a lack of rain and fertile land led the spanish to conquer new world territories in order to as
582983 but there was another equally important process at work in spain financiers work shop manufacturers and merchants with jews in the forefront were effecting changes which threatened the countrys feudal structure
582984 with rare exception jews had not been allowed to become members of europes land owning elite as a consequence they maintained social existence by adopting the indicated industrial world occupations making them urban dwelling leaders of the revolutionary capitalist transformation
582985 conservatively predictably the landholding elite initially responded to the mounting threat with a cautious antisemitism demanding jews either leave the country or convert to the elites feudal understanding of christianity
582986 while hundreds of thousands of jews took the second course their everyday practices continued to have the same capitalist order impact as before
582987 in 1478 acquiescing to pressure being exerted by the landed nobility through king ferdinand and queen isabella pope sixtus iv authored the brutal spanish inquisition
582988 fourteen years later the king and queen ordered that jews be expelled from the country
582989 but although the feudal elite could not foresee it spain would soon relieve its developing productive order crisis by exporting excess population to while acquiring huge quantities of gold silver and other mineral riches from the new world
582990 portugals situation was similar to that of spain insufficient arable land infertile soil and inadequate rainfall and like spain it relieved its feudal order crisis by exporting people and importing new world pelf
582991 spain and portugals new world successes were rapid ruthless and astoundingly profitable during one period of only a few weeks columbus
582992 francisco pizzaro had a similar experience when he entered peru after slaughtering 7 000 of atahuallpas warriors in a single night pizzaro agreed to give the inca king freedom in exchange for silver and gold atahuallpa provided him with two and a half tons of gold and five tons of silver as his part of the bargain pizzaro then had him strangled to better secure control of the country
582993 portugal too reaped and raped remarkable profit during this period
582994 neither the resistance of native populations nor their disappearance through european diseases to which they had no natural defense proved to be obstacles of great significance flagrant brutality and extermination solved the first the importation of millions of african slaves the second
582995 with large numbers of their people moving to the new world and establishing the grand fiefdoms no longer available at home their economies infused by stolen new world treasure for the next three hundred years spain and portugals feudal systems again became secure
582996 but where colonialism and the theft of latin american wealth also african wealth in portugals case would enable the spanish and portuguese land holding elites to preserve their pre capitalist orders such efforts did not work nearly so well for france and england
582997 because their feudal systems of production began experiencing structural crisis a little later than those of spain and portugal england and france trailed those two countries where attempting to vent excess population in the new world and seize its riches were concerned
582998 not that the late comers failed to try without exception all of england and frances new world incursions during the 17
582999 yet however much they prayed god seemed unsympathetic there were no vast stores of mineral wealth waiting to be seized in the unconquered regions of north america in addition the northern territories had a far less hospitable climate and were inhabited by indians who not living in large easily destroyed cities were able to fight back when their own social existences were threatened
583000 the first shipload of englands jamestown settlers arrived in may 1607
583001 additional hundreds of colonists reached jamestown over the next couple decades yet where energizing englands feudal economy was concerned the jamestown settlement continued to have little value and the colonists were soon at war with natives
583002 in 1622 347 of what were by then approximately 1 400 settlers were murdered by algonquians enraged at being driven from traditional lands by the colonizers tobacco farming writer karen lange notes that
583003 under the circumstances very few english were interested in moving to the new world and frances new world ventures proved even less rewarding
583004 both countries then tried to ease their feudal order crises with piracy if they could not compete with spain and portugal in stealing new world wealth they could at least profit by robbing the robbers
583005 the number of french and english who were finding it necessary to take up capitalist world occupations to survive had long been growing the construction of ships needed to export colonists and raid spanish and portuguese vessels the manufacturing of axes plows hammers nails guns clothing etc for provisioning their own as well as ironically spanish and portuguese settlers only accelerated that transformation
583006 having no less painful and disruptive alternative left for maintaining the majority of its peoples social existence in the mid 17 th century england underwent the capitalist revolution followed by france a hundred years later
583007 with their capitalist revolutions political power was wrenched from the increasingly decrepit hands of landowners and given to the financiers merchants and industrialists whose hour of authority had arrived
583008 the privileges the institutions of guilds and corporations the regulatory regime of the middle ages were social relations that alone corresponded to the acquired productive forces and to the social condition which had previously existed and from which these institutions had arisen
583009 i reiterated my central thesis in the annenkov letter observing
583010 by producing a drastic improvement in peoples security clothing housing food quality and therefore their health and longevity each generated a more explosive increase in population than its forerunner leading in turn to its own more rapid exhaustion and demise
583011 hunters and gatherers lived about 17 years rarely more than 20 the average life span of many capitalist country populations is over 75
583012 demographers estimate that when columbus set sail the total world population was about 400 million at present only a few hundred years after capitalist systems of production began to be erected its over 6 6 billion and rapidly growing
583013 its also obvious why the changes in productive distributive orders have all been unidirectional
583014 if the united states decided to return to a feudal existence at least 60 percent of americans would either have to be exiled or killed an estimated 2 percent of the population currently produces over 90 percent of the countrys foodstuffs using sophisticated irrigation systems tractors plows and combines that only a highly advanced industrial economy can provide the foodstuffs are then distributed via trains planes and semis which likewise require a complex industrial order for their manufacture so too with everything else americans enjoy including housing clothing medical care entertainment and travel
583015 similarly maintaining the social existences of the french or english during the 16 th century would have been impossible if they had decided to raze their feudal productive orders and revert to using nomadic slave or hunting and gathering systems of production
583016 the transition from hunting and gathering to the nomadic slave mode of production introduced an important new ingredient specific tasks began to be performed by specific individuals as the slave order achieved viability it started turning out goods and services in excess of the amount required to reproduce everyones social existence
583017 due to the division of labor some individuals the slave masters found themselves in control of that excess
583018 having a hegemonic status to be preserved the elites then needed special protective devices
583019 individuals calling themselves marxists sometimes portray elites as duplicitous where the creation and employment of philosophy religion and political institutions are concerned
583020 to the contrary ive argued elites instinctively and sincerely religio philosophical ideas create those practices which most effectively least disruptively enable them to secure their favored social existences
583021 for the same reason middle classes and the poor just as
583022 if non elite members of a community were to reject the elites philosophical vision they would have to confront the elite physically and neither of them would be socio economically sustained
583023 therefore as long as productive orders have been able to perpetuate reproduce their social existences non elites have reflexively internalized and acted upon the elites perspectives sometimes enthusiastically sometimes under protest depending upon how well they were being sustained
583024 on this matter our disagreement could not be more complete
583025 the american elites who defended their favored interests with the argument that settlers of western territories were fighting believed it to be true so too did the settlers respecting that issue no deception whatsoever was involved
583026 stalin and the soviet bureaucrats who protected their more prosperous social existences and that of the countrys state capitalist elite with the claim they were imprisoning or killing tens of millions of pro capitalist traitors during the great depression were thoroughly convinced that was what they were doing
583027 so too with the nazis proposition germany was involved in a fateful struggle against a jewish communist conspiracy to dominate the world hitler goering himmler speer and other national socialist leaders were more than willing to lie in the service of what they considered true
583028 finally american leaders were not lying when they described a threat to u s investments in latin america asia and africa from the 1960s to the late 80s the of communist communism which those with menaced investments employed was anyone or anything which threatens our interests hence for them raping torturing and killing into submission or out of existence individuals who posed the threats was seen as a painful but imperative endeavor a removal of cancer in order to save the patient they often intoned
583029 if any of you still believe this countrys leaders were insincere about their anti communist crusade i suggest
583030 during the same period the soviet unions elite employed their own unique interest protective definitions threats to their favored socio economic status which came from the right were repressed as capitalist threats from the left were labelled leftist adventurism and crushed with equal vigor
583031 in each of these cases elites and their political representatives
583032 have you never noticed that no one whether politically left right or liberal ideas which when they act upon them as valid result in
583033 granted however history is made by people acting in community and there are clearly no community exceptions
583034 similarly the people of self described socialist communist nations have rationalized not imitating che by calling him an elevated status they concede they have not yet personally attained
583035 in both instances the exceptions are idolized and as all of human history attests when people idolize they never emulate
583036 if tomorrow everyone began behaving as christ prescribed common sense argues it would mean the end of christianity
583037 the men who joined che in the bolivian mountains probably him but its illogical to suppose they
583038 its the reality of our universally shared experience that insofar as groups communities of people have the same socio economic existences to defend the question whether they should permit one another complete freedom of speech press and assembly never arises
583039 here in the united states conservatives like william bennett ramesh ponnuru and richard mellon scaife dont debate granting each other such license
583040 neither do their liberal counterparts it would never occur to hillary clinton al gore and ted kennedy to argue the propriety of allowing one another unfettered rights to organize publish and speak
583041 nor again do individuals on the left michael parenti noam chomsky michael moore and howard zinn for instance
583042 its the reality of our shared experience that whenever members of one community have found they could no longer preserve their socio economic existences if those in another community were permitted to do so they have readily taken each others lives and with a lot less hesitation theyve denied one another freedom of press speech and assembly
583043 at such moments stifling any democratic impulses they might have people have begun to oppress and to kill
583044 u s supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes defended the principle involved when he argued no one should be allowed to
583045 if you examine the courts application of the holmes proposition you will find that political ideas labelled were invariably ones which if acted upon by the public to whom they were addressed would have been expropriative of the socio economic existences of the people who called them that and the theater was said to be crowded insofar as it appeared likely the broader public might act
583046 besides protecting the elites hegemonic interests the state of productive system serves everyone by defending from threats both foreign and domestic the order which enables a reproduction of their socio economic conditions
583047 for the same reason when an exhausted order of production has been razed as its successor begins to acquire viability its self understanding i e its philosophy
583048 the formal features which attest a philosophy has achieved that importance that it is the living soul of the culture were the same in all times
583049 it follows that whether a communitys philosophy religion is perpetuated undergoes modification or is discarded entirely in favor of another will be determined by the kind and degree of material change occurring in the situations of those who embrace it
583050 morality religion metaphysics all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness thus no longer retain the semblance of
583051 if we judge our species by what we do our answer to that rhetorical question must be yes
583052 if youve followed my materialist logic of sam harris richard dawkins christopher hitchens daniel dennett and other contemporary hegelians who put ideas in the lead and blame the worlds suffering on religion
583053 like me most of you will undoubtledly agree with harris that the feudalists were
583054 however we also know because both common sense and our experience demand it that if today the people of japan france or any other industrial nation decided to restore the feudal order theyd immediately find it necessary to adopt its system sustaining web of beliefs
583055 if when confronted with this predicament harris dawkins hitchens et al still insist on maintaining their stance it goes from being implausible to being absurd
583056 were not suggesting the transition from hunting and gathering tribes to nomadic slave communities to feudal and capitalist nations was pre determined by an inflexible universe or a manipulative god
583057 while our species has reaped ever more wondrous benefits from the last ten millenia of its 200 000 year trip for equally clear hundreds of millions of us have also suffered terrible pain
583058 at the apex of such tragic moments describing challenges to their interests as a
583059 being an inveterate optimist ill remind you that while frenzied assaults by defenders of expended orders have proven fatal for countless representatives of nascent systems they have also affirmed every new systems propriety
583060 as frances feudal system became drained of viability the landed aristocracy for whom preserving feudalism was vital if their socio economic conditions were going to be maintained went on the offensive against upstart pro capitalist order protestants whose rejection of the catholic churchs authority the feudalists considered downright
583061 a decade later frenchmen who openly challenged the feudal church whether in speech or in writing were being put to death
583062 the bloodiest struggles attending the exhaustion of european feudalism took place in germany limited and insecure access to the atlantic ocean and none to the mediterranean sea had restricted trade between prussia and other countries regions including africa and the new world as a result the creation of a subcommunity of capitalist financiers craft producers and merchants had not proceeded as far as it had in france
583063 as a consequence from 1618 48 prussians battled over who would exercise feudal control of the land when the ended more than 9 million germans 20 30 percent of the population had been killed but the strain on the regions feudal socio economic political organization had been momentarily relieved
583064 not until the unification of germany under otto von bismark in 1871 were capitalist financiers and industrialists finally brought into the ascendant
583065 the civil war was not fought exclusively as it seemed to many over the moral issue of slavery or such narrow economic issues as tariffs
583066 the russian revolution of 1917 and the three year civil war which followed ended
583067 china underwent the same revolution in the 1930s and 40s suffering an even greater loss of life there too the building of an increasingly vibrant though environmentally devastating state capitalist productive distributive order has been the result
583068 mr machiavelli observed china has 10 billionaires according to the latest that number has now grown to 106 ninety percent of them children of the countrys top 2 900 political authorities
583069 what does our species 200 000 year socio economic political evolution have to do with the neocons strategy for seizing control of iraqs oil and making the united states imperial leader of the world
583070 has capitalism like hunting and gathering nomadic slave and feudal productive distributive systems before it been drained of viability has it as i will argue reached its
583071 is capitalism simultaneously forging its own successor i e is a new problem solving order coming into being within capitalist countries a new way of relating people to one another and to the production and distribution of goods
583072 if so are representatives of that nascent order beginning to threaten the elites who benefit most from the moribund capitalist system of production and distribution
583073 are those whose interests are challenged moving toward an oppressive
583074 to compete not merely with each other but with south korean chinese and indian neo capitalist producers entering the global market u s japanese french german british et al manufacturers must sell ever greater quantities of shirts shoes suits plates pots and pans hand tools refrigerators and blenders tvs cars and motorcycles etc
583075 selling that greater quantity of goods forces capitalists to engage in a never ending expansion and sophistication of production which in turn requires a writing
583076 the problem for many third world states today is that when capitalist countries buy their mineral agricultural products and pour in ever larger quantities of shoes shirts pots and pans they cut the throats of millions of poor saudis iraqis pakistanis afghanis indonesians algerians moroccans egyptians and filipinos who survive by hand making shoes and sandals shirts turbans and other items of native attire or by hammering out pots and pans or by forming and firing pottery and plates
583077 and its not only the poor whose lives are being ravaged
583078 capitalisms aggressive economic penetration of nonindustrialized countries with tvs cds dvds and movies is also devastating middle class artists and actors replacing their nations traditional tastes with those of japan and the industrial west while providing them like the poor with nothing in the way of alternative occupations
583079 even highly educated children of mid eastern elites doctors dentists architects chemists and engineers are finding the virulent capitalist invasion leaves no place for them
583080 the poor cant afford doctors and dentists there arent enough people in the middle class to pay for their professional services and the elites fly to new york london or paris for their own medical dental procedures
583081 when mid eastern oil sheikhs have palaces and shopping malls constructed in saudi arabia or kuwait when they build airports seaports luxury hotels theaters fantasy playlands and skyscrapers in dubai or a massive water pipeline in the united arab emirates they contract with global corporations like haliburton bechtel fluor parsons kajima and taisei
583082 those companies have their own architects and engineers they dont hire local professionals they also bring in low paid semi slave workers from the philippines india pakistan and sri lanka who toil 12 hours a day 6 days a week doing the menial labor
583083 with no less painful option left for maintaining their social existences or that of their nations middle class and poor some educated sons and daughters of mid eastern and asian feudal elites begin formulating plans for expropriating western interests along with their countries western oriented elites and establishing new structures which can sustain them all structures which as in post khomeini iran are in some ways terribly reactionary in others progressive
583084 moreover its not just capitalist manufacturers and financiers whose activities are devastating third world peoples the agribusinesses of advanced capitalist nations are equally aggressive in eliminating their jobs they are also destroying their environments and impairing their health
583085 according to investigative reporter john ross new years 2008 may prove to be their doomsday
583086 ten thousand square miles of amazon rainforest were cleared in 2006 alone the burning of tree stumps and branches spewing 370 million tons of hydrocarbons into the air
583087 cargill brazils largest exporter of soybeans and sugar provides few jobs nearly all of them extremely low paid many brazilian farmers under contract with cargill have been found to use slave labor
583088 monsanto cargill and other u s agribusinesses are also destroying the infrastructure of rural india by bribing indian officials theyve succeeded in promoting cotton and rice seeds genetically engineered to produce sterile plants forcing the countrys small farmers to buy new seeds yearly at prices few of them can afford
583089 nor can indian farmers rely on traditional seeds since their plants cross pollinate with those of monsanto and cargill producing seeds which are also sterile
583090 adding insult to injury when an agribusiness corporation is able to demonstrate that a farmers seeds contain a gene of its engineered plants it takes him to court and forces him to pay for using his own seeds
583091 if despite the formidible hurdles u s agribusinesses place in his path an indian farmer has a good crop it must then compete with cotton the same corporations produce in the u s using a 4 billion government subsidy they receive each year to keep the international price of cotton low
583092 indias farmers once produced all of the countrys edible oils from mustard seed sesame seed linseed and coconut then in 1998 physicist vandana shiva relates monsanto and cargill obtained a ban on indigenous oils today 70 percent of indias edible oils are soya and palm dumped on the country by u s global corporations
583093 during the past decade the activities of cargill monsanto unilever adm and other agribusiness corporations have led more than 165 000 of indias small farmers to commit suicide many of them the cruelest of ironies by drinking monsantos glyphosphate pesticide
583094 where cargills soybean production is destroying the amazon rainforest the purchase of massive and growing quantities of palm oil by u s japanese and european capitalist corporations is doing the same thing to the rainforests of borneo
583095 since 1990 indonesia has razed 61 million acres of its south borneo rainforests planting palm oil trees in their stead and it plans to level and palm tree plant another 61 million acres by 2030
583096 replaced with palm oil tree plantations malaysias immense north borneo rainforests have almost disappeared along with the orangutan and exotic birds which lived in them
583097 finally the u s and other capitalist states whose productive orders are approaching the are not only eliminating employment in the third world they are doing it at home as well
583098 if you have a problem with your computer probably made in china and phone the manufacturer youll speak with a technician living in india
583099 call your hospital to challenge an expense and you may discuss it with someone in ireland employed by the firm that does the hospitals billing
583100 doctors and dentists have begun to feel the effect of this and you will receive over 500 hits promoting plastic surgery kidney transplant heart bypass knee hip and shoulder joint replacement at hospitals located in mexico india malaysia the philippines even iran
583101 youre assured the physicians have received the latest training very likely in the west and that they use the most up to date diagnostic and medical equipment sold to them by japanese or western capitalist corporations
583102 besides a round trip flight surgery and hospitalization the tour agency will arrange for your recovery in a luxury hotel fed according to your personal tastes and visited regularly by a physician all for a fraction of what you would pay for these services at home
583103 economist paul craig roberts has countered that proposition citing numerous correspondents who are unable to find
583104 today roberts adds the jobs of indian guest workers may themselves be on the verge of being offshored
583105 princeton university economist alan blinder estimates 30 to 40 million american high end service jobs ultimately face offshoring
583106 regarding the lower end service jobs of middle class americans its fairly obvious whos helping capitalism do them in
583107 from food chains to walmart to home depot large retail stores have installed significantly reducing the number of employees required for given dollar amounts of sales

583109 over 260 privately operated prisons have sprung into existence offering investment opportunities and modestly paid to americans who are able to justify defining fellow citizens as for using or selling often small amounts of marijuana or cocaine

583114 machiavelli tacitly acknowledged the connection between the united states military industrial complex and its foreign policy when he remarked that defending the countrys third world interests from expropriation after wwii led it to drastically increase the production and sale of weapons
583115 however he offered no explanation for the growing challenge to u s investments in the underdeveloped world
583116 from the 1960s to the 90s u s corporations with threatened latin american interests had their own novel theory
583117 as in the middle east today many of the elites sons and daughters were unable to find employment which could socio economically sustain them while particularly in peru northeastern brazil bolivia nicaragua uruguay and el salvador poor indian communities were experiencing a suffering they hadnt known since the 1930s
583118 as in the middle east today the socio economic injury which children of south americas elites were experiencing prompted the more humane among them to discover empathize with the far greater distress of the poor
583119 embracing that part of my theory which describes exhausted feudal orders of production being replaced by capitalist systems like the russian and chinese revolutionaries before them they proposed seizing large foreign businesses and using the profit which operating them yielded to industrialize their countries erecting state capitalist systems that would provide employment for their middle class and poor as well as for themselves
583120 im sure you know the rest of the story so i wont waste time on elaborate detail
583121 the latin american rebels were menacing major u s corporations and that was sufficient for the u s to identify them as nixon ordered when chiles president salvador allende seized i t t and the u s copper multinationals offering to pay what the expropriated corporations claimed their properties were worth when paying taxes
583122 with indispensable u s assistance allende was overthrown on september 11 th 1973 and general augusto pinochet a fascist dictator who sincerely believed he was purifying his country of evil seized power
583123 right wing generals and admirals took control in brazil uruguay argentina bolivia ecuador and paraguay joining with pinochet to identify and assassinate the hot headed youths leading the struggle for change simultaneously suppressing worker peasants movements
583124 at least 30 000 humanistic young men and women lost their lives in many were brutally tortured and buried or tossed into the sea some alive some dead from helicopters and planes
583125 during the 1980s central america was similarly bought bullied and butchered back in line an estimated 200 000 poor indians were slaughtered in the process entire villages wiped out
583126 machiavelli observed the attendant u s stock market losses exceeded 7 trillion
583127 what he neglected to add is that 82 percent of those stocks are held by the wealthiest 10 percent of americans which meant over 5 7 trillion of the loss was suffered by the rich
583128 the u s economy was in the doldrums with many large companies hurting badly
583129 bechtel corporations earnings peaked at 15 1 billion in 1999 then plummeted to 11 6 billion in 2002
583130 under dick cheneys guidance halliburton merged with dresser industries in 1998 becoming
583131 but dresser had lost numerous suits for asbestos related deaths resulting in a 43 percent drop in the value of halliburtons stock in 2001
583132 with the collapse of the soviet union and ending of the cold war u s defense budgets had also fallen throughout the 1990s and employment in the defense industry fell with it more than 2 millions defense industry jobs were lost between 1992 and 2001
583133 keeping in mind that communities always unify around those ideas which will most effortlessly sustain them with the united states economy depressed and much of its manufacturing base off shored with the largest most profitable remaining industries military industrial in nature what would you expect this country to do

583139 u s mercenaries are benefitting handsomely the state departments corporations dyncorp international triple canopy and blackwater usa have been awarded contracts valued at over 4 billion had been paid more than 400 million for helping sell the iraq war to americans and iraqis and for polishing the image of the u s installed governments of iraq and afghanistan
583140 from the outset of the war with its economy starved for profit the u s has made a grab and gobble effort to extract it from iraq
583141 then one month after shock and awe daniel amstutz a former cargil corporation executive was assigned
583142 before leaving iraq in june 2004 l paul bremer head of the issued a body of orders mandating the kind of make money by driving third world peoples to the wall policies which are causing such deep hatred of the united states throughout most of the middle east
583143 order 17 grants foreign contractors including private security firms full immunity from iraqs laws

583147 except for a diminishing number of first and third world elites 21 st century capitalism is making it difficult to impossible for peoples in both hemispheres to reproduce their social existence and the principal instrument the united states currently uses to hold its capitalist structure together is military industrial expenditure justified by the neocons insane anti terrorist vision

583154 as a result hundreds of thousands of acres of trees in the northeastern u s are either threatened or dying as are forests throughout scandinavia and western europe
583155 vast tracts of the czech republics jizera mountains forests have perished and acid rain has destroyed so much of germanys famous black forest that its often referred to as dead
583156 driven by rapid industrial development acid rain is an impending disaster in china india russia and the republic of korea between1990 and 2010 asias sulfur dioxide emissions are expected to triple
583157 and its not just trees that are being injured by acid rain entering lakes stream and rivers the acid kills insects fish and shore birds virginas native trout streams are succumbing as are many of the lakes streams and rivers of wales their acid content increased by 30 percent in the last few decades affecting everything that lives in or is dependent upon them including humans
583158 the extraction and cleaning of coal inevitably decimates ecosystems and communities
583159 big coals representatives have been licking their lips at the prospect of tearing the tops off more u s mountains to sell vast quantities of coal to china whose own coal mining operations result in the deaths of 6 000 miners every year
583160 what can be done about the global catastrophe ive described the environmental desolation the elimination of social existence sustaining earth protecting employment
583161 while im open to argument my own answer to that question is nothing until and unless the capitalist order of production and distribution is dismantled and replaced
583162 alarmed governments around the world have been passing laws aimed at cleaning up streams lakes and seas and regulating acid producing emissions but the problem reducing sulfur dioxide emissions by 50 percent in the northeast u s alone would cost 7 billion yearly if so doing it globally would cost trillions and that would do nothing about all the other environmental devastation
583163 given its size content and distance from land removing the patch would be a mega billion dollar operation requiring the design and construction of special equipment and a second smaller garbage patch is floating between hawaii and japan
583164 as for the worlds mounting unemployment european capitalist states have begun following the united states and israels lead labelling individuals whose actions disrupt their injurious practices at home then putting them in jail those who do it abroad and employing military violence to suppress them
583165 an honest examination of capitalisms contamination of the planets air streams lakes rivers and seas with myriad pollutants from myriad sources the oil mercury arsenic lead cadmium nitrogen cyanide toluene styrene phosphate sulfur dioxide antibiotics and pcbs its mad use of nuclear energy and equally mad proposals to store nuclear waste along with its elimination of jobs in both the first and third worlds can only lead to one conclusion
583166 the capitalist productive distributive order isnt up to the task of stopping the global cataclysm its creating let alone building a better world
583167 capitalist states are no more capable of solving the disastrous problems theyre causing than nomadic slave communities could have built houses and chateaux for feudal europe or european feudal communities could have satisfied the need for factories and the clothing weaponry railways steam engines and trains those factories produced
583168 which brings us to the third of our fundamental questions
583169 if capitalism has turned into a monster devoid of self control has it like its predecessors also spawned a more effectual successor which many capitalists are having to nurture in order to reproduce their own social existence
583170 once that question has been posed the answer screams for recognition
583171 the integrated global community capitalists are defensively building can only be made to function with increasingly sophisticated high technological devices global positioning systems gps robotic machinery computers the internet broadband bluetooth etc
583172 as the computer and the internet are already demonstrating though an indispensible tool for capitalism high technology is also a revolutionary threat because living and working in the high technology world aborning will require that people take full and free control of their lives and it will require that they share
583173 the high techies who write capitalisms most complex software programs use an called linux
583174 the high technology world of freedom participation and sharing johnson depicts doesnt just touch becoming immersed in it and the reproduction of everyones social existence increasingly depends upon its continued evolution
583175 in 1999 shawn fanning helped lay the foundation of the post capitalist order when he founded fannings objective was to enable anyone with a computer and a little high tech savvy to download and distribute music programs just as quickly replaced it imesh morpheus limewire bearshare and kazaa
583176 besides circumventing the film and music conglomerates which previously exercised unchallenged and highly profitable control over their industries groups are also undertaking a significant reduction in the corporate advertising to which subscribers are forcibly subjected
583177 with hundreds of thousands of left right and liberal websites blogs available internet users can circumvent the national international news presented by major media getting news representing the experiences and interests of the people making the news directly rather than news interpreted by corporate executives or political representatives of the elite individuals who have their own sharp axes to grind
583178 as a result the viewership of corporate controlled evening news programs has as one observer phrased it
583179 cbs evening news had 19 million viewers in 1980 7 million in 2006 during the same period nbcs evening news viewership dropped from 17 2 million to 8 million abcs from 15 9 million to 8 25
583180 to make up for a consequent loss in advertising revenue the media increased the number of ads viewers must endure driving more people from the tv to the computer aware those still watching tv tend to be older the media run more ads for drugs to ease remedy every conceivable illness real or imagined suffered by the aged turning additional younger healthier viewers away
583181 robert scheer has noted rabbis ministers and priests are finding their lives being transformed by the high technology crusade
583182 in 2006 musician bob ostertag posted all of his recordings on the web where they could be downloaded free ostertags explanation for doing it is worth citing at some length
583183 when record companies first appeared making and selling records was a major undertaking making recorded music available to the general public required a significant outlay of capital which in turn required a legal structure that would provide a return on the required investment
583184 to the argument that musicians who do this lose financially ostertag replies
583185 as with music so too with writing using websites like can freely read or post fiction fantasy and horror stories
583186 the list of things inviting americans to enter a post capitalist egalitarian world is long and growing
583187 gps devices that make it possible for property owners to do
583188 even the financing of national politicians is going high tech egalitarian in the fourth quarter of 2007 maverick republican ron paul set a record for internet contributions receiving 20 million in small donations
583189 as i noted when discussing the self scanning check out counters in large retail stores it is capitalist industries which must promote such system destroying activities in order to remain competitive
583190 they manufacture the machines oster uses to record his music and distribute it on the web they make the equipment used to illegally reproduce cds and dvds they encourage public participation in tv programming etc
583191 there is another community of individuals in capitalist countries whose self sustaining activites have been chipping away at the integrity of the capitalist order the several million members of 100 plus environmental and peace organizations
583192 like the terrorists they are struggling to make changes which their countries productive distributive systems cannot accommodate
583193 theoretically of course the u s could stop creating terrorists by destroying the lives and health of third world peoples working with them to build a liveable world instead
583194 theoretically it could create and install vast pollution removing and pollution controlling systems to restore its streams lakes and rivers to health
583195 theoretically the u s could solve its energy and traffic congestion problems by financing construction and installation of solar panels on private homes by removing hydrogen from sea water to use as fuel and by building grids of high speed magnetically levitated trains
583196 until its capitalist productive distributive order is dismantled and replaced i submit the future of the u s is clear
583197 to keep its economy functioning will require ripping the tops off more mountains for coal drilling for oil in environmentally destructive places building additional life threatening nuclear power plants clear cutting additional millions of acres of national forests worsening the pollution of oceans lakes rivers and streams and poisoning more of its people
583198 it will also necessitate spending additional trillions of dollars mostly borrowed from china and the middle east on weaponry which in turn will make the existence of a large and continually growing enemy imperative
583199 which brings me to the last of our fundamental questions have some capitalists therefore begun self protectively moving in the direction of an oppressive
583200 let me answer with a few quotations which describe where you americans are at rather precisely
583201 anyone can now be imprisoned indefinitely without charges and denied any judicial review adds jim hightower
583202 the government can monitor your phone calls read your email and open your snail mail observes matthew rothschild
583203 were beginning to see who will be the inmates of the detention centers being built in the u s by halliburton under government contract the answer is civil libertarians critics of israel 9 11 skeptics critics of the administrations wars and foreign policies critics of the administrations use of kidnapping rendition torture and violation of the geneva conventions and critics of the administrations spying on americans
583204 alas explain neocons david frum and richard perle there really is no middle way for americans it is victory or holocaust
583205 statesmen will invent cheap lies putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked and every man will be glad of those conscience soothing falsities and will diligently study them and refuse to ex amine any refutations of them and thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just and will thank god for the better sleep he enjoys after the process of grotesque self deception
583206 in politics nothing happens by accident if it happens you can bet it was planned that way
583207 i could write for days weeks and years about our machiavellian foreign policy and how it has created every ill that now afflicts us
583208 there is only that which serves your purpose and that which doesnt
583209 to destroy america from the inside with their relentless attacks on morality and truth
583210 continues to act as a mirror and an echo chamber for the dark mood that has fallen over the west
583211 emanates from our divine creator whose laws are not subject to amendment modification or recission by man
583212 let me thank all of you for being here in particular i want to thank the american philosophical society for arranging the debate ive been waiting a long while for such an occasion and suffered a lot of undeserved animosity and vilification as i waited
583213 i intend to accomplish two things this evening prove to you that your neocon leaders are faithful to my philosophy and more importantly convince you that under their direction the u s will win not only in iraq but throughout the middle east
583214 if youre honest as i speak youll begin to realize im not merely describing individuals whom many of you regard as adversaries im also holding up a mirror and asking you to look at your own face
583215 youll understand we have a lot more in common than youve heretofore acknowledged even to yourselves
583216 my opponent has described himself as a materialist a realist whose only concern is with what he calls the natural necessity of historical conditions and events
583217 i will demonstrate dr marx is nothing of the sort to the contrary hes an idealist whos dangerously preoccupied with the unachievable world of his longing marx once confessed his impractical idealism in an aphorism still popular with leftists
583218 in the real world of our shared experience people come together to think and act as citizens of nation states
583219 why do people behave this way again our experience provides the answer only by joining together in national communities which they give allegiance and fight to protect are they able to acquire physical emotional and psychological security find employment build homes feed and clothe their children and raise them to share the values they hold dear
583220 in other words in the real world war with its attendent brutality and oppression is sometimes imperative if a leader would succeed in defending his state
583221 having insufficient fertile land for its growing population to own as nobles and work as peasants 15th century spains king ferdinand and queen isabella preserved their state by ordering the violent conquest of new world regions hispaniola jamaica dominica the bahamas trinidad panama the virgin islands honduras cuba puerto rico mexico and peru
583222 nineteenth century englands leaders used a combination of economic incentive and bloody conquest to obtain the raw materials and markets needed to hold their industrializing state together by 1917 one quarter of the worlds people were under british dominion
583223 only fifty years after its revolutionary birth a rapid growth in population made the acquisition of more land critical for the united states particularly for the sons of small farmers to preserve their young nation state presidents andrew jackson and martin van buren thereupon authorized the expropriation of native americans
583224 by 1838 16 000 20 000 cherokees were the only large indian community remaining in the east basing his decision on a fraudulent 1835 treaty president van buren ordered their removal to oklahoma
583225 leading a militia of 7 000 men general winfield scott oversaw the cherokees 1 200 mile forced march to their new home
583226 ninety years later as the international economy entered being the wealthiest and most productive industrial nation the u s found it could survive by outcompeting its rivals japan was soon being driven from china and other asian markets while germany suffered the same fate in eastern europe in the early 1930s germanys economy which had never recovered from wwi collapsed
583227 ordering the stimulation of their nations economies with large scale military spending the leaders of germany and japan predictably chose to employ force so that their states might endure japan occupied manchuria in 1931 in 1939 germany invaded poland early the following year germany conquered norway and france and in mid 1941 it declared war on the soviet union
583228 by the latter date the war in europe was dealing a fatal blow to japans economy in july 1941 a japanese cabinet planning board reported the war was preventing the importation of machinery from germany and italy or from switzerland through germany or italy which is vitally necessary for the production of strategic materials like germany before it japan was going down for the count
583229 forced to choose between accepting a destruction of the state or fighting japans leaders undertook an accelerated preparation for war against the u s the competitor whose defensive economic policies were having such a disastrous effect on december 7th 1941 general hideki tojo and emperor hirohito directed the infamous attack on pearl harbor
583230 nothing ive said should be interpreted as a defense of japan and germany respecting the global conflict that ensued to identify the material reasons for a nations resort to violence is very different from giving it support just as identifying the material origins of an earthquake is different from embracing its devastation
583231 unlike dr marx being an objectivist i limit my analyses to explaining whats happening and the material reasons why
583232 that said however as i made clear in my discourses on livy i believe in the greater efficacy of democracy since the united states was more democratic than either japan or germany if forced to take sides during wwii i would have backed the u s
583233 now to believe in democracy means believing leaders must have the backing of their populations it has always been my position that any leader who fails to gain popular support can not long survive
583234 however at times like those ive described leaders confront a dilemma
583235 in order to protect their people they must defend the state to defend the state they must make war to make war successfully they must have their peoples acquiescence if possible their enthusiastic cooperation
583236 the problem is that making war involves slaughtering and subjugating other humans actions which are universally considered evil it is to our species credit that the people of every nation resist seeing themselves as murderers and oppressors
583237 in order to gain sufficient popular support for or at least submission to those necessary evils wartime leaders therefore inevitably find that they must lie
583238 when ordering an attack upon another nation they must lie to defend their countrys reputation lie to get assistance from allies lie to delude their victims as occurred with the cherokees no less important they must lie to soothe the collective conscience of their citizenry unless they lie the forcible domination of another state another people cannot possibly succeed
583239 fortunately whenever the preservation of the state upon which their lives and fortunes depend is at stake people universally insist upon being provided the requisite protective deceptions
583240 the americans who settled the west during the 19th century welcomed the justifying lies told about savage and bloodthirsty indians the indians they were exterminating as they found it necessary to seize their land
583241 when the great depression devastated the world economy in the 1930s most russians embraced stalins fantastic lies about the countrys lies which vindicated holding the soviet state together by killing 7 to 10 million people and enslaving an even greater number of others
583242 during wwii only a tiny and pragmatically silent minority of germans rejected hitlers utilitarian lie that they were fighting
583243 to give a final and for most of you a more personal example throughout the 90 years since the russian revolution most americans have reflexively imbibed the remarkable story that the soviet union and subsequently china posed a socialist communist threat to their way of life a lie no less preposterous than that told by the spanish inquisitionists who tortured jews in the name of christ
583244 at the time dr marx was writing everyone including his detractors understood socialism to mean an equalization of basic income communism the more tender hearted
583245 as our common experience loudly tells us where apportioning their nations wealth is concerned neither russia nor china has ever been one whit more socialist let alone communist than any other country including the united states
583246 surely the international correspondents among you have felt the irony of filing reports in which you referred to communist china a country which forbes notes now has 10 billionaires 400 businessmen with personal wealth exceeding 100 million and many thousands of mere millionaires while an army of indigent chinese roams the streets of major cities homeless and hungry
583247 on the other hand its equally obvious that the incessant lies about a communist menace were critical for rationalizing a military defense of threatened u s industries and investments in asia africa central and south america thereby securing the united states and stabilizing its people lives which of course is why all but a few americans embraced the artifice involved
583248 while its frequently essential that political leaders lie to others as my student philosopher leo strauss observed particularly in wartime its no less crucial that they do not begin to deceive themselves
583249 a wartime leader must remain focused on the exclusive objective and associated truth for which he is directing mayhem and telling his lies
583250 the wartime political leaders objective which he lies to defend ive already told you a preservation of his state his associated truth that objective material understanding which if he can get his people to act upon it through deception will result in the states preservation
583251 whenever evil must be done to preserve the state an unspoken agreement is made between a leader and his people he will lie to procure their support which requires protecting them from assuming responsibility for the evil
583252 on their parts the people will either accept the leaders lies as fact or in the case of individuals who are less well served by the states evil acts they will busy themselves with nitpicking demonstrations that particular lies are falacious
583253 however so long as the state and therefore their lives and livelihoods are being preserved our shared experience tells us they will refrain from seeking the material reasons for the evil being done that is they will not attempt to discover and disclose the leaders personal truth the unique objective vision which is determining his actions and prompting him to deceive
583254 perhaps the most compelling evidence that the people of every nation prefer comforting fiction to disturbing truth is the universal reluctance to relinquish what were initially pragmatic lies long after their utility has been exhausted
583255 the majority of japanese have yet to confront the brutality of their countrys attack on nanking in december 1937 two hundred thousand chinese were killed many machine gunned in the street women were
583256 turkey still adamantly refuses to acknowledge that after its ottoman empire holdings were lost in wwi it maintained itself by massacring one and a half million armenians seizing their properties in order to survive
583257 very few russians have accepted the breathtaking slaughter of poles lithuanians ukrainians estonians and latvians which the soviet union carried out to preserve its existence during the depression ridden 1930s and 40s
583258 thirty two years after the vietnam war ended most americans continue to avoid the simple reality that their nation pragmatically defined poor ignorant and uneducated vietnamese laotian and cambodian peasants as communists then butchered over three million of them using every weapon at its disposal rifles bombs napalm cluster bombs 50 caliber machine guns and grenades
583259 but is it really necessary for me to defend this obvious point robert stinnetts book was published in 2000 using the u s governments official records stinnett documented what admiral robert theobald pulitzer prize winning author john toland and others had convincingly argued two decades before president roosevelt and members of his cabinet not only knew japans attack on pearl harbor was impending they worked to insure that it happened convinced it would unify the public behind what they rightly considered an inevitable war yet today the majority of americans continue to talk of japans surprise attack dismissing as conspiracy kooks those who express the material truth
583260 its clear from your facial expressions that many of you find my arguments distasteful
583261 one of the most painful criticisms ive had to endure is that i advocate immorality and evil
583262 to the contrary ive always insisted the practice of evil should be no greater in dimension and duration than a preservation of the state requires lying killing and related evils are for me strictly means never ends unfortunately they are sometimes the only means by which the states perpetuation and its peoples lives can be secured
583263 in the hope that you wont misunderstand my position let me be precise if a conquered elites hegemonic way of life can be continued that should always be done and they will thereafter reward the conquerors by helping to keep the masses subdued if the elites favored status can not be sustained one and all of them must be killed for they will never cease plotting a violent restitution of their former authority and rank
583264 if a subjugated populations way of life can be sustained the velvet glove should always be used in their governance since they will present no tangible threat if their way of life can not be maintained they must either be destroyed or driven from the region because it will not be possible to control them
583265 do you still find my words disturbing then ask yourself this question should the state be dismantled and its citizenry allowed to suffer socio economic devastation if the alternative is employing violence and deceit if you answer yes please take another look at the real world youll discover when people make that argument they almost always have some other state in mind rather than their own
583266 to repeat the central tenets of my thesis preserving the state upon which his people depend for their physical economic and social existence must be a leaders foremost objective
583267 realizing that objective sometimes necessitates making war on another nation
583268 for all the reasons ive enumerated getting his people to support a war invariably requires a leader to dissemble and deceive
583269 that said there are two more things a leader must do at such pivotal moments if he would succeed in defending his state
583270 based upon a clear headed understanding of the material necessity for initiating a war and the wars specific objectives the leader must formulate a strategic plan
583271 what makes a micromanaged strategy vital whenever a leader takes his state from peace to war this is another question you can give an objective material answer if you examine your own behavior
583272 your family has no need for a micromanaged plan when following its normal routine however any sharp break with that routine such as a camping trip immediately makes it essential
583273 you will need to plan your destination date of departure method of travel and length of stay and numerous aspects of the trip will have to be micromanaged in order for it to be a success
583274 if you determine to go by car someone must assess its mechanical condition you will have to decide whos going to do the driving the approximate amount of fuel and food needed who will prepare the food the kind and quantity of clothing required along with responsibility for a host of other matters like tents bicycles fishing licenses and equipment perhaps arranging for friends or relatives to be visited along the way
583275 so it is when a states leader determines to take his people to war except that where lies arent normally required for a camping trip as the genuinely candid among you are well aware theyre an integral feature of every nations resort to war
583276 which brings us finally to the u s war in iraq
583277 ill begin this part of my discussion by asking the critical
583278 faced with brutal competition from japan and other industrialized nations which enjoyed significantly lower labor costs by the late 1960s major u s corporations were in serious trouble
583279 the two leading auto manufacturers initially tried to weather the challenge by cybernating production then by making cars of low cost and consequently low quality in 1971 ford motors introduced the
583280 but gm and ford were soon made to understand that producing cars of inferior quality would not enable them to hang on very long
583281 with no alternative remaining if they wished to stay competitive general motors and ford then began outsourcing large parts of their manufacturing operations to low wage countries
583282 u s manufacturers of nearly every product power tools furniture canned food skis clothing radios and tvs were soon reluctantly taking the same path
583283 dr marx and his disciples would have us believe capitalists are driven by an insatiable lust for increased profit
583284 business economists on the other hand consider it axiomatic that corporations hesitate to move their operations abroad until the rising tide of competition is threatening to drown them the activities of general motors ford levis jeans dewalt and milwaukee power tools thomas mccann shoes ibm dell computers hershey chocolate and hundreds of other companies have objectively verified that proposition
583285 while the outsourcing of manufacture meant millions of american workers were losing their jobs a consequent devastation of the u s economy was prevented by the high technology revolution which occurred during the 1980s and 90s the birth of the internet and an on line global market along with the application of digitalized information to everything from experimental science to education medicine audio communication and movie making quite literally saved the day
583286 dozens of high tech companies sprung into existence lavishly funded by venture capitalists many were soon included in fortune 500s list of most profitable corporations
583287 the computer savvy entrepreneurs who founded the high tech industries often became multi millionaires almost overnight as did investors in their novel operations
583288 in the late 1990s the high tech revolution gave birth to the dot com phenomenon thousands of internet web sites offering products and advice of every imaginable kind health charity the environment pets politics education finance jewelry travel book publishing furniture making and home restoration etc
583289 venture capitalists and investors again provided hundreds of billions of dollars for these remarkable operations and again sudden fortunes were made
583290 fitness centers opened in towns and cities across the country occupations like personal trainer landscape artist interior decorator massage therapist and herbal medicine specialist acquired new respect and wider application bike shops and boat yards manufacturers sellers and repairmen of atvs and trailers restaurants coffee shops and jewelery stores travel agents and luxury liner operators orthodontists and cosmetic dentists mini storage owners makers and installers of pools spas and home theaters one and all profitted from the surge of wealth in large cities three four and five thousand square foot homes became common place
583291 you heard me correctly not seven million dollars not seven billion seven trillion
583292 but ive only begun to described the united states troubled situation as the 21st century opened
583293 with the collapse of the dot coms the growth rate of the u s economy plummeted from 3 7 in 2 000 to 0 8 in 2001 in 2002 it was still a modest 1 6
583294 meanwhile the annual growth rate of chinas industrializing economy had risen from 8 3 in 2001 to 9 1 in 2002 indias economy was also growing at a rate more than double that of the u s 4 1 in 2001 4 2 in 2002
583295 although a phenomenal increase in trade between the u s china and india was making the three nations economies increasingly interdependent china and india were beginning to pose a challenge to the u s in many countries including in chinas case those of the middle east
583296 which brings me to the united states paramount concern in that region the concern which led it to attack and occupy iraq and which if your countrys leaders continue to act defensively will soon lead it to saturation bomb numerous targets in iran
583297 that paramount concern you know as well as i do
583298 in case you havent noticed the economy of every industrialized nation floats on oil
583299 a majority of the things industrial countries make use or sell are at least partially made from oil derivatives tooth brushes soaps and soap dishes clothing telephones furniture fertilizers cosmetics lacquers television cases and park benches
583300 homes are heated with it and cars trains ships and planes are wholly dependent upon its availability at a moderate price
583301 the pool of oil guzzling industrial nations is also growing and the two most competitive industrializing countries india and china are huge and hungry
583302 chinas exports soared from 10 billion in 1978 to 278 billion in 2000 sixth largest trading nation in the world with a gdp growth rate thats sometimes double digit its thirst for oil is becoming unquenchable yet except for da qing which produces an estimated one million barrels a day china has no reserves worth consideration
583303 chinas consumption of oil is growing by 7 percent a year in the year 2003 04 it shot up 19 percent and given the countrys phenomenal growth rate it may well increase by double digits again indias oil consumption is also increasing by more than 5 percent every year
583304 as you may know the united states per day consumption of oil is 20 7 million barrels more than germany france japan india and chinas combined 19 5 million barrels
583305 the u s consumes 26 percent of the worlds oil production three times more than it produces and like chinas the rate of its oil consumption and importation continues to grow during the 1980s the u s imported 30 percent of its oil today it imports 50 percent
583306 unfortunately while the international competition for oil is becoming daily more aggressive the amount of oil thats readily still talking material reality here is in serious decline
583307 theres been a lot of debate about whether the worlds approaching is at or has already passed that critical stage at which half of the easily obtainable oil has been tapped and production begins to decline
583308 back in 1956 shell geologist dr m king hubbert was criticized for predicting peak oil production in the u s would occur sometime between 1965 and 1970 it happened in 1970 hubberts predicted peak for world production was 2006
583309 no one disputes hubberts fundamental thesis about an impending peak oil crisis any longer its a matter of quibbling over the specifics of when
583310 paul appleby british petroleums chief economist believes the worlds oil output will flatten then
583311 fredrik robelius of sweden who wrote a doctoral thesis on the subject thinks world wide peak oil production will occur between 2008 and 2018
583312 other equally informed observers insist peak oil has already happened
583313 jim buckee who earned a doctorate in astrophysics at oxford university and now heads the canadian oil and natural gas company talisman energy came to that conclusion
583314 after researching the subject so did t boone pickens the famous investment tycoon
583315 princeton professor emeritus dr kenneth deffeyes is very specific proposing the peak in world oil production occurred on thanksgiving day 2005
583316 the point is most oil men and scientists agree that while the world isnt about to run out of oil it is about to run low the peak in worldwide production definitely happening before 2020 in all probability before 2015
583317 no less alarming the impending crisis in oil production has already begun to strike the worlds leading producer saudi arabia
583318 university of california professor stuart staniford who edits the highly regarded website
583319 already half the daily output of ghawar the worlds largest oil field and saudi arabias most productive from which 6 25 percent of the worlds oil is even oil its water
583320 the largest most productive deposits of high grade readily extracted oil are in three middle eastern countries saudi arabia iraq and iran
583321 the number of new deposits being discovered is discouragingly small and none contain the huge amounts of low sulphur oil of fields in the middle east
583322 at the same time many of the worlds major oil fields including those of saudi arabia are showing signs of depletion and becoming increasingly costly to tap
583323 if the u s china or one or more european state could put the lock on the remaining middle eastern oil it would be able to dominate the world economy outcompeting other nations and or controlling their production respecting a cornucopia of goods including agricultural produce and military hardware
583324 lets not be timid about describing the united states problematic situation if china or some combination of european industrial countries acquires a monopoly on mid east oil in only a few years time it will be able to wreck the u s economy reducing americans to the poverty and dependence currently suffered by many third world populations
583325 given the interdependence of the worlds national economies would china or europe ever do such a terrible thing to another country
583326 the great depression demonstrated how brutally indifferent to one anothers situations nations become when the very survival of the state is in jeopardy
583327 and the threat of another global depression of the kind that produced world wars i and ii is always with us
583328 surely none of you are prepared to argue we have international instiitutions in place which
583329 do you doubt that the u s faces the imminent challenge ive been describing
583330 in the spring of 2002 investigative journalist jeremy scahill attended the 30th anniversary celebration of the nationalization of iraqs oil during a subsequent interview scahill reported
583331 these two fields had been allocated to two companies scahill continued one of them french the other russian but because of u s pressure and u n sanctions the russians and the french never began drilling
583332 tired of waiting for the sanctions removal rashid declared iraq had decided to go ahead with the french russian explorations for which each of those countries was committed to investing billions of dollars
583333 iraq predicted that by tapping the west qurna and majnoon fields it would be able to
583334 was this mere wishful thinking on iraqs part or was it a reasonable assumption
583335 in other words respecting the product most vital for the survival of every industrial nation the u s would then be able to dictate to the rest of the world
583336 i think we can assume scahills conclusion was apparent to american oil company executives as well as u s neocon leaders
583337 nine months after rashid made his startling declaration the u s
583338 now consider the material threat which china the oil parched colossus poses in the middle east
583339 in reviewing that threat ill simply rely on world press citations
583340 beijings target is to quadruple its economy by 2020 as it did from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s
583341 prior to the u s invasion of iraq in march 2003 china made two failed attempts to obtain that countrys oil it negotiated
583342 the u s severed diplomatic relations with iran in april 1980 following the seizure of 63 american embassy workers the previous year
583343 this fast growing symbiotic union of the chinese and iranian economies has involved china selling iran ever larger quantities of manufacture in addition to buying its liquid natural gas and its oil
583344 arab news noted partnerships between iranian companies and south korean french and japanese firms helped make iran the middle easts leading car producer in 2005 with an output totaling china is also reputed to be building an iranian auto plant for the manufacture of a low priced model while the u s stands and watches
583345 as forecast by concerned observers around the world the reciprocal trade between china and iran is continuing its phenomenal rate of growth
583346 nor are chinas overtures to the middle east being directed exclusively at iran in november 2003 the united arab emirates observed that trade between china and the seven small states which comprise the uae had grown by 42 8 percent during the first nine months of that year alone
583347 no less disturbing from the united states and israels perspective for more than 20 years china has been providing iran with the latest weaponry including missiles
583348 chinas missile trade and cooperation with iran has been a subject of substantial proliferation concern in washington since the chinas missile exports and assistance to iran have generally fallen into the provision of anti ship cruise missiles and related technology and technical assistance for irans ballistic missile program as well as some exports of complete ballistic missiles
583349 in other words iran has been rapidly moving toward the point at which it willl be able to defend itself against an attempt by another state to take its oil by force
583350 youll understand im not exaggerating when i say that as the 21st century opened the u s was approaching a fateful juncture
583351 fortunately unlike most americans being perceptive machiavellians presi er vice president cheney and his neocon subordinates have been able to assemble all the pieces of the puzzle
583352 the industrial world is heading for a showdown over control of the middle easts oil
583353 if china or europe were to win the struggle given that international competition for the sale of manufacture is already intense and much of the u s productive base is now located abroad in the event of an international depression it seems virtually certain america would suffer the fate of germany and japan in the 1930s
583354 however the neocons have recognized that western europe isnt a serious competitor in the battle for middle east oil
583355 in comparison with chinas european economies are only treading water
583356 in addition germany and france are able to buy enough oil and natural gas from russia to keep their homes heated their cars and factories running besides eighty percent of frances electrical needs are being supplied with nuclear power not oil
583357 germany and france would doubtlessly like to profit from the acquisition of large quantities of mid east oil but doing so isnt a dire necessity
583358 so the conflict over control of the middle easts oil is between those two states and whichever one wins will have the final word when it comes to determining the international practice if an international depression occurred even the survival of the other
583359 due to the economic interdependence of the two countries the victor will need to consider the interests of the vanquished but which state gives and which receives consideration is going to be of the greatest historical consequence
583360 you americans are fortunate that several leading neocons are former trotskyists who once naively supposed that when a country commits to dr marxs communist vision it undergoes a utopian transformation
583361 believing the failure of china and the soviet union to construct free egalitarian and humane socialist systems was of monumental significance they are now dedicated to protecting the united states as it builds a better world
583362 irving kristol the former trotskyist whos variously referred to as the godfather of the neocon movement expressed these sentiments lucidly writing
583363 it is not too much to say that the collapse of the socialist ideal is the most striking event in the history of political thought in this century
583364 optimistic and still devoted to moving the species forward the neocons grasp the importance of the u s winning this struggle
583365 for over two centuries america has symbolized freedom democracy and economic opportunity to the entire world
583366 china on the contrary represents religious repression thought control and a heavy handed social economic and political manipulation
583367 in the u s dissidents are criticized sometimes ridiculed in china theyre imprisoned or shot
583368 tens of millions of people around the globe dream of becoming american citizens millions risk injury or arrest every year in order to enter the country illegally hundreds dying of heat stroke and thirst in the deserts of new mexico and arizona
583369 no foreigners dream of moving to china or jeopardize their lives trying to do it
583370 your neocons realize that more than the future of the united states is at stake the western world whose very way of life values and traditions the u s represents and defends now stands in peril
583371 they recognize it isnt a question of whether the united states
583372 however the neocons also understand that china and the u s would both be ill served by a public acknowledgement of the battle their economies are much too interdependent for that
583373 in addition only japan holds a larger portion of the u s foreign debt than china 644 billion and 350 billion respectively
583374 considerable pressure to severely restrict these mutually beneficial relations is already exerted by american labor unions and by small manufacturers whose oxen are being gored
583375 if the u s china conflict over control of middle east oil were openly declared that pressure could become irresistable
583376 the critical question for the neocons in the year 2000 then was how the u s should go about waging this silent but nonetheless epic battle i e
583377 unlike during the great depression economic competition will not work
583378 few american made products can compete with chinese manufacture here in the u s they are even less competitive in the middle east
583379 as economist robert j samuelson recently observed china doesnt have only 17 percent of its workers have pensions and a mere 14 percent are covered by unemployment insurance factor in its workers low wages and its obvious that china has the upper hand where selling the middle east manufacture is concerned
583380 nor can the u s compete when it comes to buying the oil given the huge sums of money that must be paid to individuals and institutions who hold oil company stock and stock in corporations like haliburton which are involved with many aspects of drilling shipping and processing oil along with the exorbitant salaries of the executives employed by those firms its clear chinas state operated companies can afford to be far more generous than u s corporations
583381 to sum the united states fundamental dilemma its survival as well as maintenance of its dominant world position requires that it gain unchallenged control of middle east oil determining which countries obtain what amounts and at what price and that in doing so it receives the lions share of profit coming from the oil
583382 in november 2002 four months before the u s began bombing iraq the canadian investment firm union securities limited posted a very terse but very accurate description of the problematic situation the neocons confronted writing
583383 in 1950 the united states supplied roughly 52 percent of the worlds oil production
583384 beginning in the 1950s defending its third world interests from expropriation has required the united states to radically increase its production and sale of weaponry the arms sales have then helped it compensate for the competitive edge it was losing respecting the sale of manufacture in general
583385 as a consequence since the 1990s the u s has been responsible for approximately 45 percent of all international arms transactions according to the congressional research service the value of u s arms sales was 18 6 billion for the year 2000 alone
583386 most of the leading neocons have defense department histories vice president richard cheney served as secretary of defense under president h w bush donald rumsfeld was secretary of defense during both bush presidencies richard perle was assistant secretary of defense for president reagan paul wolfowitz served as deputy secretary of defense under g w bush eric edelman is presently the undersecretary of defense for policy and douglas feith has held various defense department positions
583387 these men know well that no country least of all china can match the vast array or the sophistication of u s weapons systems reconnaissance satellites b 52 bombers equipped with smart bombs cluster bombs and bunker busters unmanned predators able to track a vehicle in near silence then blow it away with a guided missile black hawk apache kiowa warrior and chinook helicopters avenger and patriot ground to air defense systems abrams tanks bradleys m88a2 hercules armored vehicles depleted uranium tipped anti tank missiles and if needed the latest in chemical and biological weaponry research on which congress granted the national institutes of health 1 76 billion in 2006
583388 on march 19th 2003 the bush neocons answered union securities rhetorical question they ordered that the shock and awe bombing of iraq begin and to date they have continued to follow my instructions with ingenuity and brilliance
583389 you will recall my advice to leaders who must take their states to war in order to preserve them
583390 in 2003 the neocons understood it would be impossible for the u s to preserve the status of the iraqi majority whatever their class
583391 education to the highest university level and cradle to grave health care was free for most iraqis women enjoyed basic equality drove cars and wore western clothing many were physicians lawyers judges chemists and professors
583392 for more than 35 years saddam hussein a megalomaniac with a stalinist personality had entertained dreams of doing what egypts gamel abdel nasser was unable to do unify the arab world then use its vast oil wealth to modernize the middle east
583393 saddam recognized that doing so would be no easy task iraqs population is comprised of a shia majority many of whom are among its poorest citizens a sunni minority from which most of the wealthiest iraqis were drawn a large kurdish minority in the north small rural communities ruled by warlords and other numerically insignificant ethnic or religious populations including chistians with so many divergent groups having divergent interests the baathists industrialization program inevitably did serious injury to one or another of them at various times particularly the shia and the kurds
583394 whenever any group dared to engage in disruption however mild saddam used abject torture and terror to drive them back in line
583395 it was evident to the neocons that having taken control of iraq the united states would not be able to cede enough oil money to maintain the cushy life style of its elite body of military officers businessmen lawyers judges scientists physicians politicians and entertainers or the comfortable existence of its large middle class
583396 protecting the united states own economy would require that much of the profit be used to remunerate its oil corporation stockholders and executives along with the heads of american firms like bechtel and haliburton which would need to operate in iraq in order to maintain the flow of oil and u s domination they in turn would use a portion of their swollen incomes to employ thousands of other americans in building and maintaining private planes sail boats ski lodges and mansions for them and their families at home
583397 in addition getting france germany japan england and china to submit to u s control of the middle easts oil would make it imperative that they be able to buy sufficient amounts of it cheaply enough to keep their own economies running smoothly given the integration of the global economy the indicated sharing of the take would not be an act of charity it would be a necessity if the u s was going to continue exporting and importing goods profitably
583398 far more important is the extravagant cost of the instrument the united states finds it must employ to gain control of the middle easts oil china has been using the free market approach well pay top dollar for your oil and natural gas and sell you low priced manufacture in return it offers an arrangement which has no attendant expenses
583399 however military force the only competitive device available to the u s in this instance is inordinately expensive in september 2002 lawrence lindsey then the presidents economic adviser estimated a war with iraq would cost between 100 and 200 billion it has already cost over 300 billion and estimates of the total price if the war continues for another few years run as high as 2 trillion
583400 at the moment the u s is putting much of this remarkable expense on the tab with japan and ironically china but eventually someone will have to begin to pay with its economy already under great strain that someone cant be the united states while their plan hasnt started working yet the neocons prewar prediction was that the u s would buy the weaponry used to dominate iraq with profit from iraqi oil when the expenses previously mentioned are included that would leave very little for the iraqis
583401 where obtaining the middle easts oil is concerned china and the u s might be compared to guests at a pot luck dinner china is able to bring a dish and put it on the table with dishes brought by others and those provided by the host the united states only option is to arrive empty handed and declare everybody away from the table im going to eat not a very friendly approach perhaps but the only one open to the neocons if they would preserve their state and western culture
583402 under the circumstances the u s had no choice in order to seize control of iraqs oil and profitably determine its distribution it would have to do the following
583403 annihilate not only saddam the countrys prince but a large section of the iraqi elite the military officers judges doctors lawyers university presidents engineers and chemists who would otherwise disruptively demand a continuation of their favored situations
583404 kill or drive from the country a few million middle class iraqis whose statuses it would likewise be impossible to sustain
583405 destroy the economic political and judicial system through which the baathists held power including the symbols of their authority
583406 raze the infrastructure vital to the countrys existence its electrical grids telephone water and sewage systems its colleges and universities rail lines and bridges this would help to force middle class iraqis out of the country by reducing their living standard to the bare survival level
583407 then it would be necessary to break the country into several pieces assigning control over each piece to that economically poorest group which would be capable of defending both its own authority and u s dominion over the oil
583408 surely you can now understand the material truth of my claim that lies arent merely useful when a leader must direct the annihilation of another people in order to save his state they are essential
583409 consider the insane consequences if the neocons had chosen to be honest prior to the
583410 we intend to traumatize the iraqi population by ripping out the arteries of their state eradicating its army destroying its hospitals universities highways and bridges its water purification systems and electricity generating plants
583411 we will make the sunnis and shiites situations so desperate that they turn upon each other to survive
583412 we are going to urge shia slum dwellers to vent the frustration and rage long smouldering in their hearts by robbing and killing those who have the things theyve been denied the countrys professionals its doctors lawyers chemists and professors
583413 we are preparing to dispatch more than 130 000 highly trained mercenaries drawn from around the world the coldest most ruthless men we are able find
583414 simultaneous with cleansing iraq of individuals who might present a troublesome opposition we are going to construct huge heavily fortified military bases from which we will direct an equally necessary destructive conquest of other mid east states sometime in the near future
583415 in case some of you still dont get it respecting the indispensable function of lies let me end my opening argument with an analogy
583416 imagine a fisherman who puts his net in the water then throws in bait to attract the fish its called chumming and it works the fish become so intent on eating the bait that it never occurs to them they are themselves about to be caught and eaten
583417 so it is with the neocon deceptions about iraq like fish feeding on chum liberal opponents of the war have focused on obsessed about the lies successfully distracted from the material realities the lies are told to camouflage
583418 in short liberal opponents of the war have been using the very neocon lies they claim to reject to evaluate events in iraq a downright mind boggling activity when you think about it in doing so they contemplate failure at every turn the countrywide destruction the raw sewage in baghdads drinking water the suicide bombings with 80 to 100 innocent people killed every day the 4 million iraqis who have abandoned their homes 2 million fleeing to syria and jordan
583419 all the while vice president cheney employs the neocons material strategy and objectives to judge the same events and with a condescending smile on his face he assures reporters that all is going well
583420 to cheney its blatantly evident that the mercenaries and american forces are creating the chaotic destruction required for the u s to gain unchallenged control of iraq and its oil
583421 its equally evident to him the neocons lies are working just as intended
583422 conservative americans continue to support the war enthusiastically while the liberal opposition fumes and fusses about neocon lies being demonstratively false studiously avoiding any materialist analyses of the war as though just touching the subject might prove fatal
583423 they write email phone and finance presidential and congressional candidates who urge the u s must withdraw from iraq ignoring the overwhelming material evidence it isnt going to happen no matter who occupies the white house and the congress a point made by retired air force lieutenant karen kwiatkowski who served as a pentagon analyst and desk officer immediately prior to the war
583424 in defense of that proposition kwiatkowski referred to the four u s
583425 all four of the bases al asad air base balad air base camp fallujah and camp taqaddum are able to accommodate the largest planes the neocons had them built to serve as launching platforms from which other middle east countries can be monitored and when necessary attacked their function and what can actually be done about them are grand scale material issues the neocons opposition almost never discuss
583426 then theres the 700 million u s embassy constructed in the heavily secured green zone while no meaningful effort has been made to provide baghdad residents living outside the green zone with basic necessities like potable water and electricity the embassy is approaching completion covering 104 acres an area larger than the vatican its the biggest embassy in the world but its objective purpose and what can or should be done with it are likewise critical material questions about which opponents of the war are silent
583427 the iraq war opposition also avoids the troublesome material issue of the mercenaries operating and killing in iraq their number equal to that of u s forces
583428 now im going to tie the only remaining loose thread of my argument
583429 you will recall that the need for leaders who take their states from peace to war to formulate a clear headed strategy which they micromanage is a central axiom of my theory
583430 it should be evident the neocons have done both things
583431 lieutenant colonel kwiatkowski among the few members of the anti war faction who seem to sense whats going on wrote of the
583432 mark halperin teddy davis tahman bradley matthew zavala paul fidalgo and others have accused cheney of micromanaging the media and indeed he did cheney micromanaged the
583433 karl rove president bushs senior political adviser was said to micromanage everything that came out of the white house to insure it accorded with the neocons mysterious agenda
583434 reporter seymour hersh wrote of defense secretary donald rumsfelds obsessive micromanaging and bob woodward elaborated upon in it his book state of denial according to woodward rumsfeld was involved with every aspect of military operations sending out a constant flurry of memoes his subordinates called snow flakes and acquiring the dismissive appellation machiavellian steadfastly refusing to look for their strategic material objective which by definition a machiavellian must have anti war liberals have gone on to accuse the neocons of micromanaging that undiscovered for the liberals non existent objective
583435 only an idiot would behave that way of course and i assure you the neocons are anything but idiots maddeningly the liberals then project their own inadequacy on the neo cons describing them as
583436 which brings me back to the matter of why people desire being lied to when preserving the state that sustains them requires the brutalization of another people the lies i observed provide the majority with a justification for the killing while enabling others to engage in make believe resistance puzzled by events dragged complainingly along after the leader who prescribes the necessary evil
583437 when the killing is finally over those whove played the role of make believe resisters are invariably found to support the results of the destruction with what they comfort themselves are clear consciences and clean hands characterizing them as the best that can be achieved in a bad situation
583438 some liberal opponents of the iraq war have already begun moving in that direction
583439 the daily killing and displacement taking place in iraq aims at achieving three iraqi parts which will be sectarian and ethnically pure as a prelude to iraqs partition
583440 a few anti iraq war liberals have now publicly backed
583441 my aunty had to go and do business in atlanta but im alone here in athens soo im just in the house you know nothing to do you know so i just came out for the first time just walking around i dont have a phone yet i dunno

583494 hamass attacks undermine my call for national dialogue between palestinian factions
583495 it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died rather we should thank god that such men lived
583496 contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen and then say what should be the reward of such sacrifices if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude than the animating contest of freedom crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains sit lightly upon you and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen
583497 many poets maintain favorites among the numerous choices of fonts indeed i recall dinner debates among classmates in my graduate writing program about the merits of certain typefaces as well as the attitude or grace contributed to the page when a slight projection of a serif adorns particular letters or an italicized word leans tastefully forward in a line my friends and i would pull books from our shelves and compliment the arrangement of print in the poetry as presented by publishers who took pride in such seemingly minor details

583500 they played together so long and we played into their hands we got caught unprepared for what they hit us with
583501 we were prepared overall but they threw something at us we didnt see much of

583519 what if im not beautiful any more why hasnt my family come to look for me am i so hideous they wouldnt take me back
583520 if you truly want to find your family again you must follow your balloons back to where you started and trust that they love you enough to be waiting there
583521 you remind me of a little girl who came to see me at the circus last night
583522 then can you tell me which path i should follow to find my way home
583523 it matters not to me unless one of them will lead to food
583524 although she was much prettier than you would you like to clean yourself up
583525 but if you could tell me which of these paths leads most directly to the circus grounds i would be eternally grateful
583526 i am trying to get back to the circus can you tell me which way to go
583527 please please do not hurt me beautiful girl i am only a clockwork rat and i mean you no harm
583528 im sure your parents will be looking hard to find a girl as pretty as you
583529 come with me i know the city and the dark i can find you safe places to sleep and food to eat after a fashion i can be the best friend you could ever imagine if only you will put me down
583530 are you worried that you arent pretty any more and your family wont want you if they find you
583531 but as long as you can keep from seeing your own reflection there is still a chance your family might rescue you before it is too late
583532 what if im not beautiful any more why hasnt my family come to look for me am i so hideous they wouldnt take me back
583533 or i should say would be the future if you dont do anything about it
583534 i have faith that you will do what you must even if you do not know what it is

583651 i made an initial investment to make the first printer and introduced it under our brand kunal

583807 nba beat writer ian thomsen wrote on friday that the latest rumor he was hearing was that olympiakos would make a bid for lebron james when he has the chance to opt out of his contract in 2010
583808 at first glance it is ludicrous to imagine that the nbas next big star would move overseas as hes trying to win championships and replace michael jordan as a household name globally
583809 from james point of view playing overseas for a year could enhance his marketing status and turn him into more of a global star than he is now he could build up his name in an entirely unprecedented way and then return home as a free agent to sign with the nba team of his choosing
583810 magazine last week is going to become more of a global star by playing for a greek team than he would in the nba ian lebron james is one of the most

583822 farmers will need to recognise that in order to successfully produce the quality of outputs that are demanded by consumers in higher value markets a skilled and motivated workforce is essential
583823 as immigration has increased native born low skilled workers those most directly affected by foreign labor programs are increasingly dropping out of the labor force and the tendency seems most pronounced among teenagers
583824 guest worker programs just cant work even on their own terms every guest worker program everywhere has failed in every instance they lead to large scale permanent settlement they spur parallel flows of illegal immigration and they distort the development of the industries in which the foreign workers are concentrated

583838 girls here dont like to marry men from india as they find them too traditional and girls in india dont wish to move to the us as they are well qualified and have good careers generally people find someone when still in college but if they dont it is hard to find someone or meet the right people when you are working hard at your job here they get to meet around 150 girls over two days
583839 for those who havent found someone we are telling them this is also a way and we are making it easier by bringing similar people together
583840 all this means that the marriage life will be longer
583841 i personally believe that us americans like obama because he wants to give us maps and end the war in the iraq and in like such as south africa and the iraq because people over here should help the obama should help mccain for everywhere like such as

583845 since 2001 that we wanted to work with the white house on recommending and giving input on judicial nominations but theyve chosen not to work with us

583868 this is the subject the entire government should handle with all its might
583869 i will firmly take emergency measures for people who are seriously affected by abnormal oil prices

583872 the ceremony wont make people forget all the controversies but they might put them aside for just 3 hours
583873 some previous ceremonies have been truly extraordinary and i have no doubt that the chinese will match that at least if not take it on to another plane

583882 web 2 0 how in the world will this thing make money have they even thought about it
583883 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
583884 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
583885 you might get that base but you wont win the election
583886 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
583887 sen obama has to go for a candidate who has national security experience
583888 sen mccain age 71 probably needs someone a little younger
583889 im going to want somebody with independence whos willing to tell me where he thinks or she thinks im wrong
583890 you really get on a slippery slope and sometimes thats unfair to the people that are under consideration
583891 we did find some areas where although he initially resisted he came around
583892 it was a classic strategy of giving the president things he doesnt want in bills he has to have
583893 in the eighth year of the presidency and in this environment bushs veto was pretty strong
583894 he had to compromise and he had to do it in two ways either they negotiated out a compromise or he was pushed into a compromise politically because of where the votes were
583895 reaches a young demographic and its important for some of these people who have been uncritically supportive of sen obama to come face to face with some of his credibility issues and when youre addressing a political candidates credibility ridicule can be very effective
583896 political ad that millions of young people will see is a negative attack on barack obama the republicans strategy is clear kill the hope thats brought millions of new young voters out of the woodwork
583897 john mccains chief financial adviser said this was just a mental recession
583898 that all your fears of losing your jobs is just in your head well i just want to ask you a simple question are you better off now than you were four or eight years ago
583899 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
583900 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
583901 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
583902 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
583903 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
583904 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
583905 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
583906 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
583907 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
583908 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
583909 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
583910 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
583911 we need to show the strength of our grass roots movement
583912 i have nothing against obama i just think john mccain has more experience
583913 john quincy adams understood the world but he didnt have a political gene in his makeup
583914 the presidency has too many moving pieces trying to gauge whether experience matters really eludes measurement
583915 he was then universally criticized for being a micromanager in the white house
583916 hes quite possibly the worst president in american history because of his inability to effectively manage southern secession and the slavery issue
583917 he understood then how you take risks and use your political judgment
583918 im still a democrat but i just cant like obama at this point
583919 the spending is almost entirely fueled by trial attorneys and business attorneys slugging it out just as they would in a courtroom
583920 i think many interest groups have grown frustrated with the partisan gridlock with legislatures and theyve realized they can often accomplish through the courts what they couldnt get through the legislature
583921 line needs to be drawn somewhere to prevent a judge from hearing cases involving a person who has made massive campaign contributions to benefit the judge
583922 created a cancer in the affairs of this court i shudder to think of the cynicism and disgust that lawyers judges and citizens of this wonderful state will feel about our justice system
583923 what do you need ill rip you off for less
583924 id love to play him hes one of my favourites and there are some things in the pipeline
583925 if people are worried that because im taking over doctor who its going to be really really frightening well then tough
583926 we wanted to break the format and do something different particularly after how powerful the climax was with the death of two major characters
583927 so were telling one big story in season 3 and putting the torchwood crew under a huge amount of pressure and just seeing how they cope with their numbers depleted
583928 it was a really difficult decision behind the scenes because we love them as people we love having them around and they were great characters you cant keep doing that where the team doesnt die week after week after week year after year youve got to show what the stakes are
583929 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed
583930 obviously i was kind of sad and sort of depressed in that sense about im going to miss everyone and the character but i think with her i think she really came full circle and she went through so much and it felt just right
583931 id be in a mall or wherever and people would come up saying ive never cried so much
583932 but there is a tiny part of me that kind of prefers she does stay dead
583933 its a big show for bbc america and its a show they are really proud of and it works really well i dont exactly know what that means in physical numbers but it gets a lot of airtime and it gets a lot of coverage

583960 the more you can squeeze out of nuclear plants the less you have to purchase use consume of the other fuels
583961 they are among the most efficiently performing coal plants in the country they are top performers in terms of nuclear theres no question
583962 the system is biased toward running power plants and building more power plants
583963 if the utilities invested in energy efficiency they would hedge and moderate their customers exposure to these fuel prices the system needs to be designed so its not skewed toward more power plants
583964 when fuel prices go crazy as they have in the past few months everything we do is in the spotlight
583965 really just an extension of the plant its like your sitting on the head end
583966 this is the second incident for both of these young men in the last year
583967 in my judgment their standing with the program is in question and they dont deserve to report with the rest of our team on sunday
583968 its truly an honor i mean even to think about playing behind those three is unbelievable
583969 is that the most the both of you can give

583975 oh ive heard of this mmu its supposed to be really good for you
583976 she was so much about being one with the world and mother nature and there was a certain amount of understanding in her that you could see behind her eyes

583979 when youre a teenager you could do a lot more crazy things and your body recovers faster
583980 but the sense of endurance and protecting your body is not there so you just learn to deal with it
583981 best of all is michelle yeoh who radiates integrity in every role she takes on and who holds our attention as a powerful sorceress
583982 were not too worried about that we can do career and family at the same time
583983 day after day the pressure to marry builds up and it becomes a source of frustration and confusion she believes
583984 employment and marriage are two rites of passage and young people today find it very difficult to face both after graduation
583985 the older you get the more youre shackled by popular opinions such as you must have a career before you have a family
583986 getting married before getting a job means the couple needs to rely on the parents financially its a very real problem
583987 people used to avoid bringing up material concerns when discussing marriage but not any more
583988 right now too many people are getting married it seems a little crowded
583989 after a while they find it hard to work again
583990 it isnt easy for a young man to accumulate that kind of wealth in such short a time
583991 but pengs story shows how much chinas fast growing online gaming industry is in need of talent
583992 the introverted side of the traditional chinese culture also means many people find it easier to make friends in the virtual rather than in the real world
583993 online games are so successful in china because other alternatives such as pc games console games or even sports the conventional sweat and grime variety are limited in the country especially in the remote areas
583994 the introverted side of the traditional chinese culture also means many people find it easier to make friends in the virtual rather than in the real world
583995 it is not surprising that many chinese companies are turning to the online game business
583996 the market has a mature business model and a huge user base thats increasing much faster than the growth of internet users in fact the turnover of chinas online game market is larger than that of the online advertising market
583997 we have managed to differentiate ourselves from other competitors by combining resources in content games and search engine
583998 chinas online gaming industry will continue to see rapid growth in the next two to three years
583999 but after that the market may reach a saturation point with some small companies forced out of the market

584008 when i stepped into the nest for the first time i felt the pressure it gave me

584025 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment
584026 id like all patients with incurable cancer to have the information they need to make a decision about whether to have this treatment
584027 but this needs nationally agreed and regularly updated statistics and earlier conversations with their doctor about the pros and cons of treatment in the last month
584028 at the moment much depends on the doctor you see

584032 we are going to learn about the issues around providing healthcare for athletes and spectators in a live summer games
584033 i am just going to see the medical side of it
584034 it is a case of fly in work round seeing how the hospitals are set up how the care for the athletes in the villages is set up and how the care for the spectators is set up
584035 then we can bring all of our experiences together and collate them and make sure that the things we identify we can solve before london 2012 happens
584036 i think we see people playing tennis every time wimbledon is on but what we fail to do is sustain that enthusiasm
584037 people get interested for a while what we need to do after the olympics is to ensure that interest is sustained
584038 everyone will be getting into the swimming pool or cycling or jogging round the track during the olympics or a short time afterwards but we need to ensure that is sustained
584039 it is about setting real achievable goals for people and accepting the idea that most people who compete are not going to win the 100m

584058 i think men are going into the priesthood later in life because theyre seeking like a lot of people more fulfillment
584059 theyre seeking something that gives them a greater sense of satisfaction
584060 perhaps they come to understand more fully what scripture says its better to give than to receive and in giving we receive
584061 certainly the church has changed a lot over the past 50 years too
584062 maybe its not as easy to hear that vocational calling
584063 thats a pretty clear indication of a trend to discern their vocation to priesthood later in life and to bring a variety of work and life experiences with them
584064 if you have a religious vocation if thats what god has in mind for you hes going to keep calling you

584240 in the end i decided that it was going to take a major overhaul of the phase not to change lots of things but to perhaps shift the balance slightly

584250 estaba en casa y cuando llegaron mis padres vi su cara y lo primero que les pregunt era si hab a pasado algo por suerte fue todo lo contrario
584251 me puedo llegar a sentir culpable si le retiran a sus hijos pero parecen desnutridos y no entiendo c mo pudo dejarlo
584252 abr la puerta para entrar en casa y tuve que salir disparado porque me atac una que se hab a metido dentro la saqu con un palo hay una aut ntica plaga
584253 roban de los carritos las cosas que dejan los padres se atreven a picar los cristales de las ventanas y est n siempre de guardia

584255 estaba en la terraza comiendo y me tuve que meter en casa
584256 im frustrated however i still feel like its priced very well and i dont see myself lowering it
584257 the thing of it is theres so many homes on the market people keep thinking if they keep looking theyll find something better something cheaper
584258 the key thing is the number of unsold homes out there
584259 that number has to come down significantly before things can get better
584260 this isnt going to put the bottom in the housing market by any means its not a big enough package to deal with continued foreclosures and the fact that housing prices have not yet bottomed
584261 people are depressed because they lost an understanding of the order of their world
584262 everything the market told them turned out to be wrong
584263 ik ga me niet verontschuldigen voor iets waarvoor het ioc niet verantwoordelijk is
584264 today you dont have any other technology than this system that can detect impacts or right of way encroachment
584265 fence building is another surprising cause of damage found in the data
584266 but if you look at most new residential developments youll find the facilities are placed on the lot lines and where do you dig a fence post
584267 it allowed us to respond and get into the area while one of the operations was still running and right after one of them had shut down

584269 has the insight to know where downtown is going and its a pretty smart move
584270 i just thought the san luis was the ideal property
584271 where you can catch a cool breeze at night and in the winter stay warm by the fire pit
584272 people are driving in from houston just to hang out at the bar
584273 this was a record year part of it is h2o part is high gas prices
584274 i go to vegas and south beach quite a lot and h2o makes me feel like im on a resort vacation
584275 upscale and pampering service its great for people watching and usually has a pretty crowd
584276 our weekend business has gone up considerably since we opened the pool
584277 even though youre in the middle of everything downtown it really feels like youre in another place
584278 its another food and beverage outlet for us and is a great amenity for the guests
584279 its an obstacle not to let the business run you if youre not careful it can consume you
584280 as that skill set is being cultivated is when i begin to see burnout occur
584281 youre not crazy and youre not lazy sometimes its just natural that it occurs
584282 it cant just be me sitting in my office making widgets anymore
584283 owners dont realize that they have to change they follow the definition of insanity thinking theyll do more of the same and get a different result
584284 some people say ive been doing it this way for 23 years and im going to do it 23 more nowadays that just isnt the case youre either moving forward or backward
584285 when you get into business its all exciting and fun
584286 but then as you start growing the business we got to a point where we needed to work on the business not in the business its just the growing pains of it the numbers start piling up and you have the responsibility of now ive got to find work for this number of guys
584287 instead of just thinking about a couple of things youre thinking about everything
584288 once you start heading off track youre going down a bad road
584289 youve got to have yourself focused on what it is you want to do whats the goal
584290 enters at different stages for different people it generally continues to deteriorate
584291 weve got to get back to your north star where do you want to go with the business
584292 burnout a lot of it is wallowing in the past things that have happened and not looking at the new things that are happening and reinventing yourself
584293 a challenge in these times is the disappointment of we didnt get that job
584294 it is what it is a closed door today leaves room for a bigger door to open tomorrow
584295 you have to surround yourself with a diverse set of people in different types of businesses that are willing to mentor you you have to listen to what they have been through and learn from their mistakes
584296 theyre using this environment to win deals that they might not have won last year
584297 theres a notion its a safe haven that markets like new york city are ultimately going to retain their value
584298 theres some reaction in the arab investment community to some of the difficulties of doing business here
584299 the commercial community in the gulf states is relatively close they talk and there are apocryphal stories of entering our country

584303 ill never forget watching johnny thunders on that program on bbc2 the whistle test johnny thunders and his crew the dolls played two numbers i remember all the musicians in newport and all the students in the union bar watching it on the television there and it just wiped everybody out the attitude the clothes it was different from all this earnest musician worshipping nonsense that had come in with progressive rock when the dolls played that british tv show that just gave us legs and arms and the spirit to really get into it

584346 the pentagon had been studying possible targets in the same spring i e 1998 that the cia had been drawing up its secret plan to raid tarnack farm
584347 leads to one person as well as one global terrorist organization
584348 we have very good evidence of links between osama bin laden al qaeda operatives and what happened on september 11
584349 proof had to be delivered that the september 11 terror attack came from abroad
584350 i have seen absolutely powerful and incontrovertible evidence of his osama bin ladens link to the events of the 11th of september
584351 there is no evidence presented in the dossier that directly links bin laden to september 11
584352 there was no doubt of bin ladens responsibility for the september 11 attacks before the tape was discovered
584353 the american translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that cannot be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it
584354 the reason why 9 11 is not mentioned on osama bin ladens most wanted page is because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
584355 bin laden has not been formally charged in connection with 9 11
584356 the fbi gathers evidence once evidence is gathered it is turned over to the department of justice the department of justice then decides whether it has enough evidence to present to a federal grand jury in the case of the 1998 united states embassies being bombed bin laden has been formally indicted and charged by a grand jury he has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9 11 because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
584357 we havent heard much from him i e bin laden and i wouldnt necessarily say hes at the center of any command structure and again i dont know where he is i ill repeat what i said i truly am not that concerned about him

584366 i was not involved in the september 11 attacks in the united states nor did i have knowledge of the attacks there exists a government within a government within the united states the united states should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself to the people who want to make the present century a century of conflict between islam and christianity that secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks the american system is totally in the control of the jews whose first priority is israel not the united states i have already said that we are not hostile to the united states we are against the system which makes other nations slaves of the united states or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom

584392 he would lean up against the easel steadying his hand that way and he painted it was not easy
584393 he just had a sensitivity to his drawing he would use a white highlight instead of the dark line and shadow
584394 the lines just flowed they were just pleasing to look at there was a lot of feeling to the faces

584427 i thought to me self arent i going to be a wealthy lad

584430 you can be anything you want to be in our country
584431 im just working here to make money to support my real love
584432 im a singer songwriter and i plan to be very famous someday
584433 right now i sing at oreillys pub in oakdale on saturday nights
584434 and ive just signed with an agent to try and get more well known
584435 can we go to oreillys pub some time to hear sean sing
584436 o k ill take you next saturday night when you girls stay over at my house i dont know what your parents will say about me taking you girls to a pub
584437 in ireland its very common for parents to take children to the neighborhood pub after all pubs are not just for for talking to the neighbors on a saturday night
584438 ill just remind my daughter and son in law that its a very irish thing to do
584439 and not to have to be bundled up to our eyeballs in coats gloves hats and scarves
584440 lets not forget about the heavy and hard to walk in boots
584441 it looks like spring is finally here at least its warm enough to go outside with a light jacket on
584442 i like this so much better than having to wear a heavy goose down jacket
584443 i dont know i guess we could always go for a bike ride
584444 our bikes have been cooped up in our garages all winter i hope they still work

584449 what we are going out to do is to learn
584450 this is our last opportunity to visit a summer games before london 2012 itself
584451 we are going to learn about the issues around providing healthcare for athletes and spectators in a live summer games
584452 i am just going to see the medical side of it
584453 it is a case of fly in work round seeing how the hospitals are set up how the care for the athletes in the villages is set up and how the care for the spectators is set up
584454 then we can bring all of our experiences together and collate them and make sure that the things we identify we can solve before london 2012 happens
584455 i think we see people playing tennis every time wimbledon is on but what we fail to do is sustain that enthusiasm
584456 people get interested for a while what we need to do after the olympics is to ensure that interest is sustained
584457 everyone will be getting into the swimming pool or cycling or jogging round the track during the olympics or a short time afterwards but we need to ensure that is sustained
584458 it is about setting real achievable goals for people and accepting the idea that most people who compete are not going to win the 100m
584459 if you can get the schools local community and parents interested you will crack a lot of the obesity problems
584460 there are so many sports that people will look at and think i want to do that and maybe they will join a local club
584461 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment
584462 id like all patients with incurable cancer to have the information they need to make a decision about whether to have this treatment
584463 but this needs nationally agreed and regularly updated statistics and earlier conversations with their doctor about the pros and cons of treatment in the last month
584464 at the moment much depends on the doctor you see
584465 this small but interesting study sheds some light on the particular difficulties in communicating information about palliative chemotherapy treatment decisions

584488 begini coba anda perhatikan di depan sana di jalanan untuk menyadari bahwa tuhan itu tidak ada katakan kepadaku jika tuhan itu ada adakah yang sakit adakah anak terlantar jika tuhan ada tidak akan ada sakit ataupun kesusahan saya tidak dapat membayangkan
584489 si konsumen diam untuk berpikir sejenak tapi tidak merespon karena dia tidak ingin memulai adu pendapat si tukang cukur menyelesaikan pekerjaannya dan si konsumen pergi meninggalkan tempat si tukang cukur beberapa saat setelah dia meninggalkan ruangan itu dia melihat ada orang di jalan dengan rambut yang panjang berombak kasar mlungker mlungker istilah jawa nya
584490 saya disini dan saya tukang cukur dan barusan saya mencukurmu
584491 tukang cukur itu tidak ada sebab jika ada tidak akan ada orang dengan rambut panjang yang kotor dan brewokan seperti orang yang di luar sana
584492 apa yang kamu lihat itu adalah salah mereka sendiri kenapa mereka tidak datang ke saya
584493 itulah point utama nya sama dengan tuhan tuhan itu juga ada tapi apa yang terjadi orang orang tidak mau datang kepada nya dan tidak mau mencari nya oleh karena itu banyak yang sakit dan tertimpa kesusahan di dunia ini
584494 these types of anti bl leaflets have been appearing in the past that went unattended by the concern authority including the sikkim police
584495 declared that if the nepalese wishes to extend its empire it need not require nepals prachand maoist
584496 nepalese being in absolute majority of 80 who ensured democracy through the revolution of 1973 can do whatever it wants even today
584497 derogatory comments are being made against siblac with the only intention of creating communal tension in sikkim siblac is an organisation that represents the sikkimese bl populace in addressing their constitutional rights in terms with article 371 f of the indian constitution our organisation is for the common political security and development of the bhutia lepcha and nepalese of sikkimese origin under the ambit of article 371 f of the indian constitution

584499 why dont you dance with me im not no limburger
584500 i told them that i was trying to work for a new consensual alliance
584501 that is what i told all the people i met today
584502 we already have an alliance of three parties now we should also have an alliance of four by including the maoists
584503 we should in this way take along all the political parties if a larger alliance takes shape then all parties will join in including the maoists
584504 they cannot work alone and such an alliance will also make it easier for them to join it
584505 people are also seeking peace and prosperity parties can claim what they believe it is for the people and media to decide
584506 we will have to work patiently consensus is absolutely necessary
584507 a surefire way to find more time to play your guitar
584508 we are fully committed to improve road condition in sikkim but what we expect is a constructive contribution from general public and ngos working in the region
584509 last year bro had undertaken 14 82 km of carpeting from ranipool onwards and this year they have planned for another 14 96 km further an amount of 40 lakhs was allocated for road maintenance last year besides this a special board of officers has been convened by hq swastik to propose strengthening works in the said road
584510 at several location culverts along the road are being blocked and water is diverted purposefully either for irrigation or for some other reasons pipelines are laid across the road leading to severe damage to the road surface
584511 we want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents
584512 we need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances

584517 existen diferentes tipos de soportes de goma espuma para poner debajo de los parlantes estos absorben las vibraciones de sub low por debajo de los 200hz para reducir el temblequeo
584518 una se ora me trajo la placa de su marido ella ten a como 90 y su esposo hab a muerto hace 50 a os
584519 alguien me escribi un mail cuestion ndome el uso de las llaves porque es el s mbolo de la propiedad privada entonces las fundimos para resignificarlas y darle otra forma
584520 al che no le hubiera gustado ni siquiera un poquito que le hagan un monumento si alguna vez compartimos una nube me va pegar una patada en el culo
584521 como guevarista me parece natural hacerle un monumento al che pero no soy un fan tico intento no endiosarlo sino hacerle un homenaje
584522 les gusta mucho a la franja de 12 a 16 a os
584523 its funny what can happen when you get friends together have a few beers and just hit the record button

584527 man girls suck they have no interest in me if only i had a girl instead of a hand then life would be about perfect
584528 the five runs we scored in the last 4 outs against these guys shows their bullpen to be non existent well look to see more pitches early on and take some balls the other way to extend the cardinals rotation pitch count and hopefully see our man kable again
584529 she is too good to associate with anybody that did not own a pair of diamonds that stood out in a crowd
584530 i have noticed that you have noticed that i do not want to be noticed
584531 lo nico que espero es que el show resulte bueno no tengo idea de qu m s esperar
584532 si bien nunca estuve ah he o do muchas cosas de la argentina cuando vayamos estaremos muy ocupados no creo que tengamos tiempo de recorrer el pa s
584533 no se nos ocurr a nada y b sicamente fue algo temporal
584534 lo mejor para la banda es poder seguir como a mediados de los 90 cuando era el momento oportuno para evolucionar y ser una banda m s grande fue nuestro mejor momento
584535 despu s de ver las colas de los jinetes que compet an en el grand national liverpool
584536 desarrollamos nuestras partes posteriores redondas para sobrevivir en el terreno africano una porci n del xito humano se debe a nuestras colas
584537 las mujeres quieren la cola del hombre en proporci n con el resto del cuerpo
584538 es mi grupo preferido de rock en espa ol creo que su aparici n gener un cambio muy saludable en el rock latinoamericano y tienen un repertorio envidiable el primer tema que escuch fue jet set por radio despu s los fui a ver en el teatro astros obras paladium v lez 9 de julio y river qu espero de la vuelta que sea un supershow
584539 cuando ten a 13 a os fue una de las primeras bandas a las que me acerqu para descifrar su m sica si bien no tengo su discograf a completa me gusta mucho doble vida donde est en la ciudad de la furia de la vuelta de soda espero mucho marketing pero tambi n mucha m sica por eso no creo que vaya a perderme semejante recital
584540 de vez en cuando las bandas grandes se tienen que juntar no voy a ir porque no disfruto los recitales tan grandes el sonido se vuela un baj n la primera vez que los escuch fue por mis primos cuando era un guachito en mi vida musical no influy pero s en mi adolescencia es un grupo que respeto y es parte de la banda de sonido de las vidas de muchos
584541 para las tres m s all de que hayamos sido fan ticas o no hay canciones de soda que son parte de todos y representan una influencia inevitable no recuerdo cuando los escuch por primera vez pero existen desde que tenemos memoria no tengo discos de ellos pero me encanta en la ciudad de la furia y zona de promesas voy seguro a verlos
584542 soda no signific absolutamente nada para m y la primera vez que los vi fue cuando ten a 12 a os en xenon un boliche de ese momento fue sorpresivo porque todos fuimos a bailar pero de repente se apagaron las luces y aparecieron no tengo ning n disco de la banda y no espero nada particular de su regreso m s all de que la gente salga contenta
584543 la primera vez que los vi fue en la esquina del sol y era realmente under no hab a m s de 100 personas y tocaban al nivel del piso desde ah que me fascinaron y los escuchaba mientras andaba en skate cerati siempre fue una antena que supo captar la vanguardia mundial y retransmitirla en argentina los voy a ir a ver y espero que la destruyan como siempre
584544 en vez de buscar la forma legal para que los lugares no est n cerrados se invirti la carga de la prueba que haya una guitarra da por sentado que un lugar es peligroso
584545 el m ximo tribunal de la ciudad declar parcialmente admisible la demanda en unos meses nos van a llamar para exponer los argumentos
584546 el derecho del autor de expresar su obra y exponerla en p blico ley de propiedad intelectual o ley noble
584547 despu s de la tragedia de croma n se intensificaron los controles en toda ciudad en el caso de las actividades culturales la normativa a veces es confusa contradictoria o incluso faltante si a esto le sumamos cierta informalidad el panorama era m s complicado a n es innegable que esto deriv en una merma de lugares
584548 clarificar y ordenar normas que revitalizar n el circuito de rock
584549 un lugar debe estar en ptimas condiciones de antemano pero si hay 50 parroquianos uno se levanta y se pone a recitar una poes a no necesita habilitaci n especial pero si se le suma alguien con una guitarra requiere de un permiso especial
584550 cuando a un local se le piden permisos especiales tiene que ver con la insonorizaci n no con la seguridad
584551 mi coraz n dej la banda hace rato y ahora siento que es apropiado dejarla f sicamente
584552 nos llevamos muy bien hasta fuimos a la misma secundaria

584557 la escuela es un tr mite que hay que terminar a todos nos rompi las bolas pero est bueno tener un t tulo secundario te puede ayudar a andar un poco m s despabilado por el mundo para que no te caguen tanto
584558 hasta el d a anterior no sab amos si toc bamos no tuvimos que pagar ni nada
584559 la escrib en ese momento porque ten a que hacerle frente a todo pero el esp ritu de la canci n tom forma cuando ten a el segundo resultado negativo el tema tiene liberaci n y alegr a la idea en la canci n es de saber que iba a vivir

584561 eso es cuando descubrir que estaba bien fue como mirar a ese momento horrible para despu s volver a la vida normal
584562 cuando juntemos la plata volveremos a ir al estudio tenemos 89 temas

584575 es una obra que escrib con dos compa eras sobre el retorcido cerebro de un hombre que quiso asomarse a la cabeza de una mujer
584576 apenas nos queda tiempo para repasar las materias o dormir una siestita

584697 snicker what i said was even at the time of the debate of the surge was if you put 30 000 troops in of course its going to have an impact theres no doubt about that the question is does it solve our larger strategic questions and do the costs involved uh do they outweigh the benefits
584698 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse i think it takes pressuire off the iraqis to arrive at the sort of political accommodation that every observer believes is the ultimate solution to the problems we face there so i am going to actively oppose the presidents proposal i think he is wrong

584716 no voy a participar de un gobierno que tiene las manos manchadas de sangre
584717 we congratulate you on having a referendum on the lisbon treaty as that proves that your democracy is stronger than ours
584718 the entire process of carrying through the eu constitution and the lisbon treaty has been characterized by heavy manipulation you too are experiencing measures taken by the eu system aiming at limiting the objectivity of the debate in ireland one instance is the instructions within the eu system to avoid sensitive questions that will be influenced by the lisbon treaty you also experience threats as to what will happen if your referendum should result in a no to the lisbon treaty but those are empty threats you are entitled to decide for yourselves and the rest of the eu must respect your choice and make common cause with you regardless of the outcome
584719 events across 16 european countries dedicated to the referendum in ireland
584720 unless the european council acting unanimously decides to alter this number
584721 france was just ahead of all the other countries in voting no it would happen in all member states if they have a referendum there is a cleavage between people and governments a referendum now would bring europe into danger there will be no treaty if we had a referendum in france which would again be followed by a referendum in the uk
584722 the difference between the original constitution and the present lisbon treaty is one of approach rather than content the proposals in the original constitutional treaty are practically unchanged they have simply been dispersed through the old treaties in the form of amendments why this subtle change above all to head off any threat of referenda by avoiding any form of constitutional vocabulary but lift the lid and look in the toolbox all the same innovative and effective tools are there just as they were carefully crafted by the european convention
584723 i think its a bit upsetting to see so many countries running away from giving their people an opportunity
584724 they decided that the document should be unreadable if it is unreadable it is not constitutional that was the sort of perception where they got this perception from is a mystery to me in order to make our citizens happy to produce a document that they will never understand but there is some truth in it because if this is the kind of document that the igc will produce any prime minister imagine the uk prime minister can go to the commons and say look you see its absolutely unreadable its the typical brussels treaty nothing new no need for a referendum should you succeed in understanding it at first sight there might be some reason for a referendum because it would mean that there is something new
584725 sometimes i like to compare the eu as a creation to the organisation of empires we have the dimension of empire but there is a great difference empires were usually made with force with a centre imposing diktat a will on the others now what we have is the first non imperial empire
584726 public opinion will be led to adopt without knowing it the proposals that we dare not present to them directly all the earlier proposals will be in the new text but will be hidden and disguised in some way
584727 the most striklng change between the eu constitution in its older and newer version is perhaps that in order to enable some governments to reassure their electorates that the changes will have no constitutional implications the idea of a new and simpler treaty containing all the provisions governing the union has now been dropped in favour of a huge series of individual amendments to two existing treaties virtual incomprehensibilty has thus replaced simplicity as the key approach to eu reform as for the changes now proposed to be made to the constitutional treaty most are presentational changes that have no practical effect they have simply been designed to enable certain heads of government to sell to their people the idea of ratification by parliamentary action rather than by referendum
584728 the substance of the constitution is preserved that is a fact
584729 the substance of what was agreed in 2004 has been retained
584730 90 per cent of it is still there these changes havent made any dramatic change to the substance of what was agreed back in 2004
584731 the aim of the constitutional treaty was to be more readable the aim of this treaty is to be unreadable the constitution aimed to be clear whereas this treaty had to be unclear it is a success
584732 the good thing about not calling it a constltution is that no one can ask for a referendum on it
584733 referendums make the process of approval of european treaties much more complicated and less predictable i was in favour of a referendum as a prime minister but it does make our lives with 27 member states in the eu much more difficult if a referendum had to be held on the creation of the european community or the introduction of the euro do you think these would have passed
584734 it is true that we are experiencing an ever greater inappropriate centralisation of powers away from the member states and towards the eu the german ministry of justice has compared the legal acts adopted by the federal republic of germany between 1998 and 2004 with those adopted by the european union in the same period results 84 percent come from brussels with only 16 percent coming originally from berlin against the fundamental principle of the separation of powers the essential european legislative functions lie with the members of the executive the figures stated by the german ministry of justice make it quite clear by far the large majority of legislation valid in germany is adopted by the german government in the council of ministers and not by the german parliament and so the question arises whether germany can still be referred to unconditionally as a parliamentary democracy at all because the separation of powers as a fundamental constituting principle of the constitutional order in germany has been cancelled out for large sections of the legislation applying to this country the proposed draft constitution does not contain the possibility of restoring individual competencies to the national level as a centralisation brake instead it counts on the same one way street as before heading towards ever greater centralisation most people have a fundamentally positive attitude to european integration but at the same time they have an ever increasing feeling that something is going wrong that an untransparent complex intricate mammoth institution has evolved divorced from the factual problems and national traditions grabbing ever greater competencies and areas of power that the democratic control mechanisms are failing in brief that it cannot go on like this
584735 if its a yes we will say on we go
584736 the constitution is the capstone of a european federal state
584737 are we all clear that we want to build something that can aspire to be a world power in other words not just a trading bloc but a political entity do we realise that our nation states taken individually would find it far more difficult to assert their existence and their identity on the world stage
584738 public opinion will be led to adopt without knowing it the proposals that we dare not present to them directly all the earlier proposals will be in the new text but will be hidden and disguised in some way
584739 france was just ahead of all the other countries in voting no it would happen in all member states if they have a referendum there is a cleavage between people and governments there will be no treaty if we had a referendum in france which would again be followed by a referendum in the uk
584740 the difference between the original constitution and the present lisbon treaty is one of approach rather than content the proposals in the original constitutional treaty are practically unchanged they have simply been dispersed through the old treaties in the form of amendments why this subtle change above all to head off any threat of referenda by avoiding any form of constitutional vocabulary but lift the lid and look in the toolbox all the same innovative and effective tools are there just as they were carefully crafted by the european convention

584751 may be a member of the european union established by virtue of that this sentence shows that the european union which would be established by the lisbon treaty although having the same name is constitutionally and politically a different union from that which we are currently members of which was established by the 1993 maastricht treaty constitution invalidates laws enacted acts done or measures adopted by the state that are necessitated by membership of the european union referred to or prevents laws enacted acts done or measures adopted by the said european union or by institutions thereof or by bodies competent under the treaties referred to in this section from having the force of law in the state

584768 so theres a big hole in the tree canopy so theres a lot of light getting down to the ground and theres a lot of vegetation growing there
584769 but as im walking i could see a patch of bare soil that didnt look quite right and when i got closer i could tell it had been cleared and some plants had been planted they looked like theyd been grown somewhere else and then actually replanted in the park
584770 ive seen pictures of the leaves before ive actually seen marijuana plants before too and i was a little surprised to see them right there theyve been found in the park before but its been a long time

584859 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
584860 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
584861 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
584862 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
584863 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
584864 benefitting from early detection through a doctor ordered mri the cancer is not life threatening
584865 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
584866 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
584867 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
584868 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
584869 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
584870 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
584871 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
584872 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
584873 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
584874 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
584875 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
584876 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
584877 these people decided who the winner is five minutes after the election this is their characteristic feature i learned about my alleged resignation from journalists levon ter petrosian and his team mates have exhausted the sources of lies which exceed all possible borders

584879 ok lets say all the grenades pistols and automatics were planted by the regime what do you have to say about all those hooligans with rods and sticks beating the police throwing bricks and stones burning
584880 hi this morning i walked from the opera house until mashtoz underpass everything was just fine police closed the underpass toward city hall and near the french embassy where they made a mess my friend 8 30 at night went everywhere with the exception of closed areas and found calm all shops are open and traffic is normal 8 people got killed and about 30 people got arrested for looting all young guys
584881 the state of emergency suspends the application of several rights and freedoms protected by the european convention on human rights under article 15 of the convention the armenian government must inform me of the measures which it has taken and the reasons therefore i expect that they will do so without any delay
584882 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
584883 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
584884 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
584885 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
584886 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
584887 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
584888 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
584889 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
584890 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
584891 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
584892 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
584893 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
584894 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
584895 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
584896 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
584897 the world faces a global climate emergency it is now clear that only action by both developed and developing countries can

584899 i think it is clear that we have an issue here and something is wrong with the system flawed with the system and we have to address it
584900 both parties are talking the green bay packers and brett
584901 and i think the discussions are moving ahead i would hope that we would have something resolved by monday
584902 granting an evil calculated killer any kind of dispensation is criminal and leaves the judiciary with blood on its hands
584903 the decision to surrender to the appeal of this cold blooded murderer is nothing but unforgivable i urge you to do whatever is needed to reverse this travesty of justice
584904 to say that i and the 140 000 police officers i represent throughout england and wales are appalled and disgusted with the decision that david bieber will now not serve a whole life sentence is a gross understatement and my heart goes out to pc ian broadhursts family
584905 this is shockingly disrespectful to his memory and illustrates the utter travesty of our criminal justice system where the rights of a cop killer outweigh the rights of a fallen officers family friends and colleagues david bieber is a monster with no consideration for life
584906 the fact that his appeal was initially lodged on the grounds that it contravened his human rights is ludicrous he showed no mercy or concern for human rights when he ignored pc broadhursts appeal pleading for his life before being executed at point blank range
584907 not enough is done at the very top end of the tourist market
584908 everyone in bordeaux thinks people wait on bended knee for their wines but nowadays excellent wines are produced all over the world
584909 the oenotourism trend in bordeaux is more oriented towards volume agencies and hotels and restaurants catering to the very top end are harder to find
584910 in my view luxury tourism can only be tailor made for very small groups often of two people
584911 we have no limits really it is up to what people want
584912 americans are the avid wine lovers they are looking for discoveries to learn about different grapes and comparisons with californian wines they want to know the history
584913 the russians stay two or three days with a chauffeur and an interpreter and have very heavy tasting schedules
584914 there are more and more luxury clients but the competition is tough
584915 places like italy spain and portugal have made huge efforts we have lessons to learn
584916 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
584917 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
584918 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
584919 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
584920 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
584921 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
584922 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
584923 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
584924 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
584925 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
584926 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
584927 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
584928 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
584929 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
584930 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
584931 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
584932 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
584933 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
584934 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
584935 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
584936 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
584937 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
584938 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
584939 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
584940 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
584941 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
584942 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
584943 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
584944 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
584945 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
584946 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
584947 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
584948 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
584949 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
584950 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
584951 who are open to doing something on the production side
584952 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
584953 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
584954 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
584955 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
584956 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
584957 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
584958 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
584959 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
584960 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
584961 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
584962 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
584963 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
584964 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
584965 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
584966 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
584967 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
584968 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
584969 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
584970 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
584971 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
584972 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
584973 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
584974 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
584975 this could be a complete disaster or it could be transcendent

585086 it is important to update our boys on the pharmaceutical products that may unwittingly expose them to banned substances
585087 when i was very young i would help my parents gather vegetables take them to the city and sell them
585088 when i was 28 years old and couldnt vote people laughed about it
585089 in america as leaders of the world we dont vote we need to vote in large numbers
585090 while i was in school i read about and saw the terrible things happening to black people in america
585091 i wanted to discover what i might do to help
585092 even his enemies listened to what he had to say
585093 i came to town on a blustery february day all i saw was sand and tumbleweeds i said no no no and went back to l a by july i changed my mind
585094 you have to get involved if you want things to change
585095 i look at him as the guru of the black community
585096 he gives a lot of guidance and sage advice because hes been there and done that
585097 hes always been willing to get out front on issues that affect the african american community
585098 if i could follow in someones footsteps i would like them to be his
585099 hes always willing to discuss community concerns and work with children he loves being involved
585100 hes always been a gentleman who could disagree without being disagreeable
585101 i look at my adversaries as though if i keep talking to them theyll change
585102 i dont worry or talk about age i thank god that ive seen so many things and that god has some use for me
585103 we want to make sure that we give him his due and his just rewards while hes in a position to enjoy and appreciate them
585104 follow the road less traveled because it makes all the difference
585105 but i am not scoring runs as a number three batsmen i have got to score runs and in this series what have i got
585106 i have had some good balls a little bit of bad luck but i set myself a lot of high standards and in this series i have not got anywhere near those standards so i want to look at that and make sure i get back to playing like i can
585107 you have to deliver out in the middle i am an experienced player and at the minute i am not delivering so i will have to come up with a formula to give myself the best chance to deliver when the pressure is on
585108 let the dust settle because emotions always run high after defeats like this
585109 its the first time i have ever lost back to back games and i am more gutted than anyone because midway through the day i expected us to bowl them out for 200 and win quite comfortably
585110 let the dust settle from today and try to work out where we are
585111 we are not playing the level of cricket which i would like i cant fault any of the efforts from any of the players they are giving it absolutely everything but we are just not playing well enough as a unit or as well as we can and that has to be looked at
585112 there are a lot of us who have to look at the batting and say we are not performing to the standard we would expect
585113 it was a real bitter blow that because when we had hat partnership between collingwood and sidebottom to get us up to 280 i put us as favourites to win the game
585114 but it was a very special innings from graeme smith
585115 the way he came out and played and chased down that target was as good an innings as i have ever seen under that sort of pressure
585116 we threw everything at them we had that flurry of wickets in the afternoon and we just felt we were going to get wickets consistently and blow them away
585117 even in the last hour i thought we were one wicket away
585118 i have obviously had some really meaningful innings in my life including the double hundreds here on the last tour
585119 but when you sum the whole situation up so many teams have come here and strived for victories without success i would have to say that its my best
585120 i guess we would wish we could be back home to share it with everyone as we know it means so much to people for us this was bigger than just a cricket game
585121 since readmission we have targeted wins in australia india and england
585122 we have ticked off one of them and that is something we really wanted to do
585123 i am thankful we are not going to the oval at 1 1
585124 it really helped me that it started raining because i was able to go in the locker room and talk to my coach
585125 it wasnt easy to talk to my coach because he was really mad then i realised that if i start to play my game to put more pressure on her to step in the court then i have a chance to play against her and to win this match
585126 shes a very tough opponent she proved that this week
585127 she beat some very good players but its another match i just want to focus on myself playing my game being aggressive
585128 its still one match im so excited about this about my game and that im in the final of a tier i for the first time

585132 i hope you hang yourself with your h amp m scarf while jacking off listening to mozart
585133 i think that somehow we learn who we really are and then live with that decision
585134 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land
585135 my delegation attaches high importance to this institution as a means of engendering meaningful co operation in many important areas and we are confident that the fund will evolve into a viable and effective saarc mechanism
585136 hmm hot chick whoa you can totally see her underwear
585137 we continually look into trends and where popular culture is going
585138 obviously the simpsons is a property that has been wildly popular
585139 there are plenty of rides that are based on original content but pop culture is very important
585140 the author of the potter books j k rowling has been very involved in the creation of the attractions
585141 it was a ride then it was a series of successful films and then that led to the revamp of the ride
585142 during the peach festival and wine festival theres always a shortage of places for people to stay
585143 i readily admit weve stolen ideas from the best of california tuscan and france in terms of hospitality
585144 we hope that we can create the same atmosphere that other wine countries have
585145 but the only reason we couldnt do it anymore was liability these photos mean something to me because my family owned land that these photos refer to
585146 she was a fabulous artist she had a wonderful sense of color and design and she was the best dressed that never changed
585147 she liked being around the creative spark and walt took her under his wing
585148 everyone in the city from millionaires to the shady citizens of the underworld goes in fear of the bat a cold blooded loner whose crimes range from jewel theft to murder and whose calling card is a drawing or some other form of expression of bathood

585150 fehlten die haie w rden sich die anderen fischarten schlagartig vermehren
585151 das wiederum w rde das plankton im meer bedrohen und das produziert 70 prozent des sauerstoffs auf der erde
585152 die natur hat da eine art fortpflanzungsbremse eingebaut gerade weil haie so perfekte raubtiere sind
585153 in der geschwindigkeit in der wir diese tiere ausrotten haben sie keine chance den bestand zu erhalten
585154 wir waren in costa rica und standen in lagerr umen wo die flossen getrocknet werden da hingen in trockengestellen die flossen von ein bis eineinhalb millionen tiere man muss sich das vorstellen diese tiere sind unentbehrlich f r das kosystem meer und sie werden get tet f r einen teller suppe ich habe mich gesch mt ein mensch zu sein
585155 wenn sie einem wei en hai unter wasser begegnen kriegen sie ehrfurcht die tiere sind ans u boot ran geschwommen haben uns mit gro en neugierigen augen angeguckt und da habe ich gesehen dass das auge gar nicht schwarz ist sondern dunkelblau
585156 dann ist man eigentlich viel zu nah dran wenn man das sieht aber es ist ein faszinierendes erlebnis mal f r einige sekunden im mittelpunkt der aufmerksamkeit eines gro en wei en hais zu stehen
585157 begging social work to help us find our patients a snf
585158 you thought going into medicine was about helping people but its actually about writing notes thousands and thousands of notes
585159 watch the intern as she spends hours on the phone making follow up appointments
585160 you listen very very closely on rounds then you make about a million checkboxes in the margins of the sign out based on even the most casual of comments made everyone then goes off the or you spend your day getting each and every single box on that list checked off by the time evening rounds happen so help you god
585161 even if your checkboxes list such tasks as find patients roommate so she can get key to her apartment back so she can go home and patient needs semi truck moved from where it is parked in the ed parking lot
585162 a what an african american president would mean for the idea of america what an african american president would mean for the idea of america
585163 and thats how we became people arent you glad that you are a person and not a monkey
585164 tell me the story where the fish stays in the water
585165 there was a fish and he just kept swimming around in the water and he never even tried to take any step on the sand and he swam down to the bottom of the water with his family and they all ate some moss off a rock
585166 look george grass that grows on walls thats called moss
585167 never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee
585168 we didnt land on plymouth rock my brothers and sisters
585169 well i reached out my hand in friendship and unity and my hand is still reaching out
585170 of course i would always reach out to senator obama but there are more important things to discuss
585171 now wait a minute anytime anyone raises an issue theres always some kind of explanation its just very difficult to get a straight answer and thats what we are probing for
585172 i have to take them off because we want to use them again next year
585173 why do we want to use them again next year
585174 because it will be christmas again and well put the lights on the new tree
585175 im unscrewing these things down here so that i can pull the tree out then were going to leave it on the sidewalk where we leave the garbage some men with a big truck will come to pick it up
585176 this is our avocado tree this isnt the kind of tree we pull out
585177 we only throw out the christmas tree the rest stay stuck in the ground
585178 t he best way to preserve ideas in the absence of writing is to think memorable thoughts whose zing insures their transmission in an oral culture cliche and stereotype are valued as accumulations of wisdom and analysis is frowned upon for putting those accumulations at risk theres no such concept as plagiarism and redundancy is an asset that helps an audience follow a complex argument opponents in struggle are more memorable than calm and abstract investigations so bards revel in name calling and in enthusiastic description of physical violence since theres no way to erase a mistake invisibly as one may in writing speakers tend not to correct themselves at all words have their present meanings but no older ones and if the past seems to tell a story with values different from current ones it is either forgotten or silently adjusted i t is only in a literate culture that the pasts inconsistencies have to be accounted for a process that encourages skepticism and forces history to diverge from myth
585179 i speak in this self important manner because i am an important leader of men
585180 i have something to tell you that is kind of good and kind of sad too
585181 milky had to go away she was in pain now she is in a place where there is no more pain
585182 her nose was hurting her so much and she went to a place where she wont feel any more pain
585183 i loved playing the violin and it would be amazing to start playing again
585184 some of us are right and some of us are wrong some of us are ready and some of us are not
585185 thousands of people across this country who are praying that a little will become much
585186 until the spring of 1944 the prisoners over 60 000 slaves who were brought in to work round the clock on the v 2 rockets lived underground the sanitation was totally inhuman there were no toilets and there was no water the temperature was eight or nine degrees celsius 46 48 fahrenheit and humidity was 90 percent they died like flies
585187 in many ways we have all changed a lot since the years that we lived together in our house as a family and the world has changed too
585188 when i think of the socially accepted roles for men and women during the 1970s and early 80s i sometimes think of captain kirk
585189 that he would sit in a leather padded armchair in the center of the cockpit what did they call it the bridge and from that position decide the fate of the whole crew
585190 dad in many ways you were the captain kirk in our family in many ways you were the traditional dad i always knew that you would have the final say on things you held our fate in your hands
585191 what i want to express to you today is that even though that traditional role of father as unquestioned
585192 you make it sound like i wasnt even there as if i was a nobody
585193 dont you guys at least agree with me i mean you dont have the final say do you
585194 i was trying to say something true and loving but if you dont want to look honestly at your past if you dont place any value on self examination then i guess i cant do that
585195 in popes latest teaching an argument for hope not atheism in the face of struggle
585196 in popes latest teaching an argument for hope not atheism in the face of struggle
585197 w hen large truths are genuinely inconvenient whole societies can at least for a time ignore them yet as george orwell reminds us sooner or later a false belief bumps up against solid reality usually on a battlefield
585198 we have a purpose we are many for this purpose we will rise and we will act
585199 what really matters is the celebration of the birth of jesus christ
585200 to thank you and your family for the warmth and friendship that youve shown ouuurs
585201 go leave the water running and see how quickly that will last
585202 the newscaster said something anodyne about the strong feelings of the people of new york but sitting on my couch all the way out in california i felt the same feelings of rage and a desire to overpower anyone who could have done what they did
585203 junkie pothead thats where id been headed something that could push questions of who i was out of my mind something that could flatten out the landscape of my heart blur the edges of my memory
585204 hang on with a bull dog gripe and chew amp choke as much as possible
585205 i will never apologize for the united states of america
585206 in this remote and seemingly safe spot were gathered more than thirty yahi including young children and babies well supplied with food even to fresh and dried meat
585207 one night five years ago michelle and i were awakened by the sound of our younger daughter sasha crying in her room
585208 it turned out that sasha did have meningitis although a form that responded to intravenous antibiotics
585209 sasha is fine now as healthy and happy as a five year old should be
585210 and i am reminded that unlike tim wheeler the steelworker i met in galesburg whose son needed a liver transplant unlike millions of americans whove gone through a similar ordeal i had a job and insurance at the time
585211 when you wake you shall find all your favorite little toys
585212 look george here they are thats where your great grandparents are stan and catherine stavrum
585213 they lived here in oakhurst they had a house here by a river
585214 but they are here now in the ground and its beautiful look at the sun
585215 dont look at me youre the dumb ass who apparently needed to body surf those stairs get up
585216 im going to pound this ping pong ball right down your throat get ready
585217 freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom freedom opens the windows of the soul so that man can discover his most profound beliefs and commune with god freedom and religion endure together or perish alone
585218 well what do you expect hes speaking at the georgh h w bush library
585219 no i dont know that atheists should be regarded as citizens nor should they be regarded as patriotic this is one nation under god
585220 the nation does need to have people of different faiths but we need to have a person of faith lead the country
585221 something one believes in and follows devotedly a point or matter of ethics or conscience
585222 atheism is not a religion dont try to shoehorn non belief into a belief because it is not
585223 my second reaction is to redouble my commitment to working for a future where some day romneys view on the central place of religion in american life is considered a relic of a time when a great country founded on the basis of equal consideration for all people was held in thrall to a destructive exclusionary myth called
585224 founded on the basis of equal consideration for all people
585225 yeah all my positions are pretty much exactly the opposite of what you want them to be but at least im telling it to you straight unlike that romney guy
585226 at amp t traffic was about 1 3 web non video audio streams 1 3 web video audio streams and 1 5 p2p
585227 preparing for english speaking visitors a restaurant in china recently ran its name through an online translator took the result then purchased and mounted a large sign
585228 it takes a tough man to make a tender chicken
585229 it takes a hard man to make a chicken aroused
585230 it wont leak in your pocket and make you pregnant
585231 ill continue to telework until i am fired at that point i am certain i can find a better paying job with a better corporate culture way to go at amp t lets force all of your talent out the door and replace it with contractors
585232 people nearing retirement value quality of life issues not spending every day in traffic being able to set their own hours and establish a more sensible work life balance makes sense to them also many are already shifting to part time work anyway that can readily be done from home
585233 for the younger demographic these are people who grew up on instant messaging social portals wireless networks and 24 7 connectivity the idea that they have to commute an hour plus each way to an office and work eight hours a day in a cubicle seems absurd to them as they become the work force expect the days of the cubicle to become numbered
585234 not one of these statements focussed on any tangible economic reasons why the policy is such a fiasco
585235 ppl i cant save it for you please dont asked thanks
585236 hold on to what is good even if it is a handful of earth hold on to what you believe even if it is a tree that stands by itself
585237 ppl i cant save it for you please dont asked thanks

585239 tennessee voices the bush administration in rhetoric that is eerily similar to that used to build the case for a war against iraq asserts that the iranian quds force is arming anti u s groups in iraq and providing them with high tech roadside bombs and sophisticated rockets it dismisses the national intelligence estimate conclusion that iran suspended its nuclear weapons program the white house has not provided evidence to back up its claims i suspect it never will and when israels deputy prime minister shaul mofaz tells the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronoth an attack on iran is unavoidable if tehran does not halt its alleged nuclear weapons program what he is really telling us is we should prepare for war
585240 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

585249 it should be a couple months before im able to walk on my own
585250 i know im lucky to survive that far of a fall
585251 he was saying things like kill cops shoot cops ozark police capt thomas rousset said on july 23
585252 theres no way i could stand up i had a broken back and a broken foot he said
585253 i definitely want them to get punished i dont want them to get away with it

585266 this is totally baseless the claim is rubbish there is no truth in this
585267 baitullah did not write any letter to anybody he never asked for any help or assistance
585268 the phone calls ive had from liberal party members vindicates what ive done and whats happened and so im very pleased with this move
585269 its certainly not sour grapes ive had enough wins and enough losses in my life and i think i can handle a pre selection
585270 we think the premier needs to be honest and open with the people of queensland as to where she is heading with mr reids appointment and with this labor party policy to review shooting galleries in queensland
585271 there is a concern we will have them here and it will slip through under the radar
585272 previously the government has said they wont be having shooting galleries but the party has adopted this policy that is being kept pretty well under wraps and theyve appointed the man who introduced them in new south wales as the head of queensland health
585273 there is a very real concern we will see shooting galleries here in queensland
585274 the biggest challenge is that most aboriginal peoples numeracy and literacy levels arent that good and arent sufficient to be able to do the general mine training courses
585275 we need a lot of pre training to get people ready to join the mining industry or any kind of industry
585276 we need to have a longer term target than two years i think we need to establish cradle to grave strategies for employment and training
585277 we need to start focusing children as young as grade two and ensure that they are starting to establish the basic foundations in numeracy and literacy
585278 from the highest in the land to the employers of two or three people only the question to me is how can i help
585279 im gratified by that and i believe this is now an idea of australian employers not of mine of australian employers whose time has come
585280 what i do know is that unless you set targets unless you set goals we have one as a government its called closing the gap you turn around in five 10 or 15 years and theres no progress
585281 far better to set some ambitious goals even if you fall short and i commend andrew forrest for his ambition
585282 a welfare only response to these communities is precisely the wrong way to go
585283 weve got to get housing right weve got to get education right weve got to get health right but weve also got to get jobs right
585284 and thats where corporate australia comes in and i look forward very much to partnering with our major australian corporations in what is their initiative
585285 ive hung around corporate australia for a number of years ive heard a lot of goodwill from people but ive never been actually sure about whether those doors are openable from the outside
585286 supplements or herbal products which can set you back anything from 10 to 70 a bottle are not the smart option
585287 theres little to recommend the use of ginkgo for preventing dementia or improving memory or cognition if youre healthy
585288 the current evidence for brahmi isnt convincing enough to warrant paying for supplements
585289 eating well staying socially connected and exercising the mind and body all count
585290 i feel revolted just from these letters on the screen
585291 how do you take the second step of showing that even though 90 of the time you hear tell of free markets
585292 vote obama because its good to hurt when you pee
585293 i am so fucking confused right now i feel like there is something i am missing and i am just not geting it
585294 i feel revolted just from these letters on the screen
585295 how do you take the second step of showing that even though 90 of the time you hear tell of free markets
585296 vote obama because its good to hurt when you pee
585297 i was certain a mistake had been made because it was a check for 60 000
585298 there were so many zeroes it didnt seem possible and i was certain id have to return the money but after a few phone calls i discovered that no mistake had been made it was quite a thrill
585299 you would think england and america would work well together
585300 were a very focused company in terms of our business one of the ways we try to find books is to establish what kinds of books would identify with the reader
585301 the role of women in the brazilian culture or economy has evolved
585302 if you think of the u s 20 years ago i think this is happening now in brazil in this case women rethink their role
585303 there is something very universal about falling in love about getting your heart broken about picking up the pieces about becoming whole again
585304 pension while others who have amassed a portfolio of properties have become very wealthy
585305 all he has to do is call me and say he is all right and we wouldnt have to hound him like a fugitive
585306 ill go home and redo it in my head re create it think about the family members
585307 you definitely carry it home with you to make sure youre not missing anything
585308 there are so many cases where the circumstances leave you scratching your head
585309 one thing ive noticed with what we do is you dont want to box yourself in
585310 it seems like most of them are men and they just want to be with a different family or have a completely different lifestyle
585311 matthew as smart as he is if he doesnt want to be found itll take a genius to find him
585312 like in the movie the guy left and didnt tell his parents or anybody what he was doing and they were just beside themselves
585313 law enforcement is really limited as to what we can actually do
585314 there is nothing to keep you from walking away from your home and meeting new friends and starting a new career
585315 hes either in witness protection or down in mexico on the beach soaking up rays and drinking margaritas
585316 it is hard not to care for her shes been such a delightful person
585317 she got here and was comfortable and adopted a new way of life
585318 he started getting sick he never did get back up after she left
585319 in my opinion i dont think theres anything to worry about
585320 we are doing some computer modeling to see what might have caused these low readings
585321 paine who is the main person doing the testing told us he would have no problem with any of his five children walking down 770 and going to our school and hes the expert
585322 and they promised to assist with emergency funding if there was a problem and we had to relocate
585323 but we will need more information than this to make plans for our future
585324 the commission felt everything is ok but they cant guarantee it everybody is saying this is just the best information they have but we want more
585325 the main thing is that we have to determine that all is well and safe in the town so that we can get along with our everyday life
585326 we want more information than they are giving us we want to know what these gravity lows really are
585327 as long as things are being monitored there should not be any danger
585328 that translates not only into workers for the houston metro market but it is also an attraction for employers to locate here
585329 while no economy is bulletproof we in harris county and fort bend county can be grateful that we at least appear to be bullet resistant
585330 also oftentimes we may be at capacity for certain services in the medical center
585331 it is really nice to be able to offer people a place to work and place to live that is not so far away
585332 and that has really helped our recruiting over the last two or three years in attracting people here
585333 houston and harris county are such huge economic engines if they werent there we wouldnt be here
585334 fort bend county is no longer a bedroom community you are beginning to develop an economy of your own
585335 if you look at congestion times we are still favorable for a big city
585336 we think more companies will look to locate closer to the work force rather than making the work force travel to them
585337 i think that bodes well for us in the future
585338 it would be inherently cruel to move her to mexico
585339 weve grown up with jenny shes our family she deserves better than getting sent to a drive through tourist attraction in mexico
585340 jennys situation is of great concern to many people i represent
585341 this is not an indictment of the zoo in mexico but jenny deserves to be somewhere she will be happy
585342 we know she is a nervous elephant and with protected contact she can approach people if she wants to and we can monitor her stress levels easily without anyone getting hurt or killed
585343 you try to keep your mind busy and go through the natural process of any type of trauma
585344 it is just like he was virtually sitting at home one night and disappeared
585345 it probably was a blessing in disguise for us to have to move out of here
585346 there will be people on the porch who saw him but they look away
585347 the people here you could tell some of them are bad but they respected me i guess
585348 to the best we can discern there has not been any qualified management on the site for three months
585349 tenants said the last person was a lady that came by to collect cash only payments
585350 were trying to go through the proper channels but if we have to wait too long local taxpayers may have to pick up the bill for spraying
585351 until we get the green light from usfws were asking every resident with red welts on your arms and legs to call your congressman or senator to make it happen
585352 the term structurally deficient means that a bridge cannot carry the load for which it was originally designed
585353 in other words it has too much traffic and has experienced some deterioration which makes it eligible for federal funding
585354 the efforts undertaken by the texas department of transportation to rehabilitate and maintain the states 50 000 plus bridges are obviously constrained by financial realities but safety is always at the top of our minds
585355 we will repair the bridges with the greatest need as quickly as we can other bridges may require more aggressive maintenance due to their age or due to a high traffic volume and we understand that
585356 i read with relief your statement that all of the bridges on texas public roads are safe
585357 but the minnesota highway department i assume thought that was true for their state too
585358 the hilles family has become a military force and members of the family have been attacking abducting and even killing people
585359 we must put an end to their attacks on innocent citizens
585360 a convenience store is a convenient target for the bad guys
585361 theres cash handy its open late its easy to get in and out so we have to make it difficult
585362 the ultimate goal of this ordinance is to make the convenience stores safe for the employees that work there and safe for the communities that shop there
585363 everybody thinks outside this country that america is a very rich place

585597 he has brought a new level of interest and fans to the sport that werent there before he arrived
585598 when you show the best golfer in the world using certain balls irons apparel viewers want to use the same equipment no other athlete could have built up the brand at the rate he did
585599 he is everything modern footballers dont want to be an embarrassment to his own peers
585600 we are a free country and i guess people want sam on television
585601 its a rough and tumble show but sam went too far
585602 this will be the first time i will be dancing on the small screen and im pretty excited about it
585603 im not a good dancer but im giving it a shot im hopeful that my fans will surely like my dancing act
585604 no one wants to be the gouger but we announce it every day
585605 we have a secret weapon we shall cease to be your enemy
585606 youre really hot and irresistible but i just really cant right now and i really need to leave

585610 asian american grassroots strategy session with special guest congressman mike honda
585611 t here emerged a new model sometimes called zionist since it drew its name from the claim that africa was the zion for africans
585612 developed and gave his name to the church of jesus christ on the earth by the prophet simon kimbangu
585613 the strongest christian presence in asia and second now only to the united states among sponsors of missionaries
585614 routinely broke the law by conducting political litmus tests on candidates for jobs
585615 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me
585616 reveal that the u s epidemic is and has been worse than previously estimated and serve as a wake up call for all americans
585617 with more people living with hiv than ever before there are more opportunities for transmission
585618 a scathing indictment of how profoundly u s and cdc hiv prevention efforts have failed
585619 there is absolutely no good news here without an accurate picture of the epidemic vastly underestimated for the last 10 years we have missed countless opportunities to intervene with effective public health strategies
585620 are one of the most severely impacted groups in the world
585621 we had a few drinks paul said that he would like to take me to the beach i knew very well that he meant for sex
585622 theres almost twice as much turbulence experienced in the winter months than in summer over greenland
585623 the pacific route between australia and the us is another hotspot for turbulence that occurs almost all year round
585624 the us is terrible in the northern summertime because of storms
585625 about a dozen in flight turbulence injuries are reported in australia each year to the atsb and many more go unreported some of these injuries are serious and have resulted in broken bones and head injuries
585626 most commercial aircraft have on board weather radars so they typically avoid the main parts of the thunderstorm however turbulence can occur in regions where the radar is not seeing much but where there is visible cloud
585627 you thought it was necessary for you as a wife to support your husbands heroin habit you were under emotional pressure from your husband to continue funding his addiction
585628 its clear that staggering sums of money were being misappropriated by you on a daily basis
585629 we are putting america at more risk not less risk
585630 across the spectrum of biothreats we have expanded our capacity significantly
585631 adherence to institute safety procedures by laboratory personnel is lax
585632 will continue to work to finalize the sunscreen rule as soon as possible
585633 the spending is almost entirely fueled by trial attorneys and business attorneys slugging it out just as they would in a courtroom
585634 i think many interest groups have grown frustrated with the partisan gridlock with legislatures and theyve realized they can often accomplish through the courts what they couldnt get through the legislature
585635 line needs to be drawn somewhere to prevent a judge from hearing cases involving a person who has made massive campaign contributions to benefit the judge
585636 created a cancer in the affairs of this court i shudder to think of the cynicism and disgust that lawyers judges and citizens of this wonderful state will feel about our justice system
585637 were all just taking shorter trips instead of going to yellowstone or yosemite this is still cheaper than flying and staying in hotels and you cant beat the lifestyle
585638 you have to be strong hearted to fork over that kind of money at the pump
585639 but sold out rv parks tell you that cooler heads are prevailing if the average motor home owner drives around 6 000 miles a year thats about 1 000 more in diesel fuel for some owners that just means spending 1 000 less a year on cocktails
585640 the down market is winnowing out some of the manufacturers and dealers on the fringe
585641 the fleetwoods and winnebagos are also feeling the pain but theyll hang in there
585642 but after getting the calculator out we realized fuel would cost us as much as 1 200 each so we decided to come here instead
585643 and if gas prices double well all just be bunking together
585644 i have nothing against obama i just think john mccain has more experience
585645 john quincy adams understood the world but he didnt have a political gene in his makeup
585646 the presidency has too many moving pieces trying to gauge whether experience matters really eludes measurement
585647 he was then universally criticized for being a micromanager in the white house
585648 hes quite possibly the worst president in american history because of his inability to effectively manage southern secession and the slavery issue
585649 he understood then how you take risks and use your political judgment
585650 im still a democrat but i just cant like obama at this point
585651 this data confirms what librarians have seen from experience that in times of economic difficulties people turn to their libraries and librarians
585652 this summer instead of renting them i get them from the library
585653 therefore there are roughly 225 000 more people living with hiv in the u s than previously suspected
585654 the previous estimate was 1 million to 1 1 million
585655 im really glad its getting warm and not cold an ice age would be really bad
585656 species cant adapt or keep up in an evolutionary sense because everything is happening so fast
585657 the changes are all happening faster than the models had predicted
585658 sen obama has to go for a candidate who has national security experience
585659 sen mccain age 71 probably needs someone a little younger
585660 im going to want somebody with independence whos willing to tell me where he thinks or she thinks im wrong
585661 you really get on a slippery slope and sometimes thats unfair to the people that are under consideration
585662 once you have to choose between eating and fuel theres nothing greater than going back to the beginning and making your own
585663 i watched the prices go up when i went to the supermarket id say wow this is 3
585664 you put a little seed in and it comes to maturity like a child
585665 its not only the high cost of food but the high cost of every other activity people are staying around their homes and looking to do things they find rewarding
585666 i think the thing that tipped the scale was the fuel and food costs
585667 were sick of rising fuel and food prices so were turning this weed patch into a vegetable garden want to help
585668 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
585669 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
585670 you might get that base but you wont win the election
585671 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
585672 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
585673 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
585674 we need to show the strength of our grass roots movement
585675 we talked about the oil boom weddings everything under the sun
585676 but nobody ever mentioned that missile i guess that shows that people arent worried about it im certainly not
585677 it has to be 100 percent stable for movement its not a quick process we have to make sure everything is stable first
585678 if there is a problem they will take care of it
585679 theyre moving them things around all the time so were used to it
585680 it probably takes 10 to 12 years to play a good taps it sounds simple but it isnt sometimes the simplest songs take the most work
585681 but there just arent a lot of people playing the bugle out there
585682 i started to get how to play taps when i began to empathize more with the family
585683 it is the breaking point of the funeral a lot of the time it is not until that point where you see the closest family members or the next of kin start to break down
585684 the ones who can get through it are the ones who can run
585685 where you have deer you have mountain lions which is another good reason not to feed deer next to your house
585686 if you have a mountain lion thats been burned in a fire if you capture and treat it thats a challenge then theres a problem if you release it again
585687 whats important is to make sure that these animals have a place to live in the future
585688 many people want more tribal involvement and management and some want it turned over to the tribe
585689 my job is to balance the park service mission and very strongly listen to what the tribe is suggesting and maybe do something that should have been done long ago
585690 the thing we havent done with each other is listen
585691 most people that weve had contact with would still like to keep the land as pristine or as environmentally safe as possible
585692 im going to rely on my elders as to what direction to take
585693 thats another part of america that can be opened up and viewed and utilized for everybody
585694 tribes are getting a fair shot at being able to do this i think its commendable for the park service and every effort should be made to make this happen
585695 what well do in our plan is to make a recommendation for the management structure of the park also in that plan well make decisions about how resources and the visitor experience should be managed if it stays within the system
585696 ive seen couches ladders washing machines right out in the lanes
585697 barbecue grills tire rims groceries garbage bags and pieces of drywall and insulation with cars swerving around them
585698 what would i have done i didnt know there was such a thing as road rangers
585699 in tight budget times its hard to justify having somebody out there just to give out gas and change tires
585700 we did find some areas where although he initially resisted he came around
585701 it was a classic strategy of giving the president things he doesnt want in bills he has to have
585702 in the eighth year of the presidency and in this environment bushs veto was pretty strong
585703 he had to compromise and he had to do it in two ways either they negotiated out a compromise or he was pushed into a compromise politically because of where the votes were
585704 at some point relying on miracles is not going to be the best way to manage our system
585705 i would pray we dont have to have another disaster to bring about the right attention to this i see very little political will there
585706 the minneapolis incident obviously caused people to stand up and take notice but i think it got dwarfed by the bad economic news
585707 whos to blame congress the american people for putting up with it
585708 structural deficiency ultimately determines whether a bridge will stand or fall
585709 if you look at the full picture of bridges and the task that transportation professionals have
585710 we need to take them down not leave it to mother nature
585711 the federal government has basically ignored infrastructure at every level
585712 we have far more applicants than we have positions for
585713 theres a shortage of teachers and teach for america is really helping us out
585714 there was a need to hire about 500 teachers and we werent getting a lot of resumes
585715 that was one of the first times since i put on a badge and a gun that i saw them as kids
585716 i dont think theres anything in the framework of teachnola that can get you used to that
585717 i dont know if i was this excited about my first job out of college
585718 you can see where theyre dipping the pen in to get more ink
585719 i would say its probably a souvenir copy done at the time and signed at the time
585720 i believe in my fellow citizens our headlines are splashed with crime yet for every criminal there are 10 000 honest decent kindly men if it were not so no child would live to grow up business could not go on from day to day decency is not news it is buried in the obituaries but it is a force stronger than crime
585721 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
585722 john mccains chief financial adviser said this was just a mental recession
585723 that all your fears of losing your jobs is just in your head well i just want to ask you a simple question are you better off now than you were four or eight years ago
585724 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
585725 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
585726 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
585727 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
585728 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
585729 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
585730 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
585731 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
585732 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
585733 if you had asked me about my chances before the judge ruled id have had a neutral response
585734 my family and i didnt know where to turn who to contact
585735 we were sitting there talking and the next thing you know i reached up and choked jennifer
585736 i did this on my own without any prior discussion with dustin turner he did not encourage me in any way and in fact i remember one instance while i was choking jennifer dustin trying to pull my hands away
585737 were always concerned about what the other side has to say against us
585738 but if you present credible testimony of the actual murderer its hard to say someone would have found turner guilty
585739 im not so angry anymore i do still harbor some feeling toward the prosecutors but its not a hatred
585740 perhaps when i walk out these gates itll be a different story
585741 empire of the outsourced it worker who works for 10 centsa day and will later hack the web app he built for your company after it goes into production
585742 the central flyway will not be included in the canvasback and scaup changes to allow for the completion of the hunters choice experiment
585743 our defence held us in especially in the second half with some big plays
585744 they were pretty much waiting on him at the line of scrimmage once he got there
585745 they did a good job of getting off our guys and getting back there and making the tackle
585746 my teammates got off the ball real good and i just cleaned up
585747 our guys came to play and got pressure we worry about the plays in front of us and not the plays behind us
585748 i probably would have had to hit one of the best balls of my life to get that sucker in
585749 we came here knowing it was going to be a tough game and it was
585750 our offensive line won the battle and our line pounded them around giving us holes
585751 its coming to a point where we need to do a lot better with our discipline
585752 for a couple games now weve hurt ourselves until we correct that its going to be a long season
585753 you have to be realistic i have nothing against this guy its nonsense
585754 i think some employers are insensitive i dont think they have any understanding of pregnant employees they need guidelines
585755 small businesses have trouble just trying to cope with someone being off on maternity leave
585756 hiring someone who is pregnant brings additional complications for them
585757 new mums and dads will soon be able to get up to two years of shared parental leave and still get their old jobs back under new employment standards both parents will now get the right to 12 months unpaid parental leave as long as they dont take it at the same time from january 2010 employers will have to hold their jobs open and will not be able to refuse requests
585758 working women would be entitled to paid leave for one year after giving birth under a bold plan being sponsored by the rudd governments key adviser on womens issues
585759 we just dont want to subject another family to all this especially as they go through the transition of owning a new animal
585760 weve limited his media appearances to three times a day weve done everything to manage his stress levels
585761 no we are not giving mindanao away even if we accede territory to the new armm or the bangsamoro juridical entity the generic name we are not giving away sovereignty and territorial integrity of the philippines
585762 so whats the talk about giving away is it giving away or just enabling the bangsamoro to be in one place in one contiguous area
585763 remember the memorandum of agreement is a preliminary agreement that is needed before we go to formal peace talks
585764 we just have to remember that all provisions must be conforming to the constitution any attrition of territory or addition to the armm will be by plebiscite and this plebiscite will not happen without the enabling law enacted by congress
585765 defined territory and a system of governance suitable and acceptable
585766 you cannot define yet the waters because there will be a joint commission to determine that its very technical
585767 whats wrong with that its a regional security force defense will always be in the national government thats the same as the mnlf agreement they have the regional security force
585768 is there a way to cut that terms of armm officials short what happens if we have an agreement but yet we cannot pursue it
585769 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
585770 that conforming your life to christ doesnt necessarily mean giving up a homosexual lifestyle
585771 such actions and views as those above fly in the face of the clear teaching of the holy scriptures and the resolutions of the lambeth conference 1998 rowan williams would not have the confidence of the vast majority of anglicans in the world who are now in the third world and who as loyal anglicans take the holy scriptures as their supreme authority his appointment would lead to a major split in the anglican communion including the church of england
585772 if his consecration proceeds many provinces are likely to consider themselves to be out of communion with the episcopal church usa this will tear the fabric of our communion at its deepest level and may lead to further division on this and further issues as provinces have to decide in consequence whether they can remain in communion with provinces that choose not to break communion with the episcopal church usa
585773 strangely before the deadline and before the primates could get the opportunity of meeting to assess the adequacy of the response of tec the episcopal church and in a clear demonstration of unwillingness to follow through our collective decisions which for many of us was an apparent lack of regard for the primates lambeth palace in july 2007 issued invitations to tec bishops including those who consecrated gene robinson to attend the lambeth 2008 conference at this point it dawned upon us regrettably that the archbishop of canterbury was not interested in what matters to us in what we think or in what we say
585774 we cannot succumb to this turmoil in our communion and simply watch helplessly we have found ourselves in a world in which anglican leaders hold on to a form of religion but consistently deny its power
585775 every bishop to teach and to uphold sound and wholesome doctrine and to banish and drive away all erroneous and strange opinion
585776 lets talk about knife crime and the poor and not sexuality
585777 this issue of homosexuality in the anglican communion has a very serious effect in my country we are called infidels by the moslems that means that they will do whatever they can against us to keep us from damaging the people of our country they challenge our people to convert to islam and leave the infidel anglican church when our people refuse sometimes they are killed these people are very evil and mutilate and harm our people i am begging the communion on this issue so no more of my people will be killed
585778 is grounded in the holy scriptures and in such teachings of the ancient fathers and councils of the church as are agreeable to the said scriptures in particular such doctrine is to be found in the thirty nine articles of religion the book of common prayer and the ordinal
585779 it professes the faith which is uniquely revealed in the holy scriptures of the old and new testament as containing all things necessary for salvation and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith and which is set forth in the catholic creeds and to which the historic formularies of the church of england bear significant witness which faith the church is called upon to proclaim afresh in each generation
585780 would respect the dogmas of the church epitomized in the creeds as showing in the language and thought forms of the age that produced them balanced and authoritative affirmations excluding false theological solutions and including the necessary theological ingredients for such christians however both doctrines and dogmas are so inadequate to the living reality of whom they are the attempted theological formulations that they cannot command full commitment or loyalty in the best sense of the word they are provisional
585781 in our doings that will of god is to be followed which we have expressly declared unto us in the word of god
585782 in scripture an evolving convergence on the ideal of lifelong monogamous heterosexual union as the setting intended by god for the proper development of men and women as sexual beings sexual activity of any kind outside marriage comes to be seen as sinful and homosexual practice as especially dishonourable
585783 christina applegate was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer
585784 benefiting from early detection through a doctor ordered mri the cancer is not life threatening
585785 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery no further statement will be issued at this time

585787 i thought organising the ball would be a great way for me to use my skills and also raise the 5000 which is required for me to be eligible to enter the competition
585788 orange worries me because it is the major non metropolitan centre for the dpi
585789 its been a great boon to the orange economy and i hope to hell these jobs are not coming from orange
585790 any services the dpi offers are people on the ground so any cuts are going to affect services
585791 lets get one thing straight there is no forced redundancy program
585792 the front line service delivery to stakeholders will be maintained
585793 it is the single biggest issue teachers deal with and its changing in its nature
585794 i cant take credit for its invention because it was here when i arrived but it is a wonderful tool
585795 now that i have agreed to this program i am so much more aware already of how much water we are wasting
585796 the problem is with everything in the bathroom kitchen and laundry being automated you loose track of how much water you are using
585797 we have our log books now so every time we flush the toilet have a shower or do a load of washing we have to record it so council knows exactly how much water we are using
585798 the whole thing kicks of on monday so we are really quite excited council will be offering weekly prizes and at the end of the six weeks the property with the most dramatic water reduction will win a water saving asko washing machine
585799 the impact of oil prices on local economies is extremely big
585800 this is the subject the entire government should handle with all its might
585801 i will firmly take emergency measures for people who are seriously affected by abnormal oil prices

585808 major risk to the sustainability of the murray darling basin
585809 deep aquifer domestic water bores have no effect on surface springs creeks and reservoirs
585810 domestic bores should be the right of a landowner to tap into
585811 the people are going to have to fight this and take it to the next election
585812 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
585813 wow gorgeous loaf of bread but i could never make it
585814 you goin through it bein a poor black man woman in america
585815 true love cannot be found where it truly does not exist nor can it be hidden where it truly does
585816 love is like a friendship caught on fire often hot and fierce but still only light and flickering deep burning and unquenchable
585817 i have learned not to worry about love but to honor its coming with all my heart
585818 to love a person is to learn the song that is in their heart and to sing it to them when they have forgotten
585819 love has no other desire but to fulfill itself but if your love and must needs have desires let these be yours to melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night to know the pain of too much tenderness to be wounded by your own understanding of love and to bleed willingly and joyfully to wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving to rest at the noon hour and meditate loves ecstasy to return home at eventide with gratitude and then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips
585820 people will have nothing to tell them for sure whether or not you are good enough to be one of them
585821 the other day i was reading newsweek magazine and came across some poll data i found rather hard to believe it must be true given the source right
585822 how he didnt kill his wife but if he did he would have done it this way
585823 vengeance is mine saith the lord and the department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation and the marines
585824 dont tell me that you all came up exactly libertarian
585825 these orange dots are the 9 jedi that we are after they are young and old padawans knights and 2 masters are all here
585826 these blue dots are the guards that are protecting the jedi there are 12 on the outside and 12 on the inside at all times no body said this was going to be easy
585827 these yellow dots are our main targets and biggest threats this yellow dot is a jedi master named malik morodo he is on the 6th floor and in the same room as our next major target jedi master jason kavor they are in room 13 on the 6th floor of this building
585828 they are jedi that arent afraid to die remember that this isnt going to be easy but lets remember one thing
585829 if fate brings us back together were meant to be
585830 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets
585831 he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them in to office
585832 it appears that church had received some publicity regarding its liberal stance
585833 desegregation racial harmony fair wages womens rights and gay rights
585834 his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets
585835 why cant obama bring himself to acknowledge the surge worked better than he and other skeptics thought that it would
585836 most american commentators are so focused on the relative fall in casualties that they do not stop to consider how high the rates of violence remain
585837 that is about the rate recently in iraq according to official statistics
585838 i dont know how you respond to something that is such a false depiction of what actually happened
585839 because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others
585840 and it began the anbar awakening i mean thats just a matter of history
585841 i would say mccain is three quarters right in this debate
585842 who is weak and i do not feel weak who is led into sin and i do not inwardly burn
585843 not to us o lord not to us but to your name be the glory because of your love and faithfulness
585844 dont let the childlike awe and wonder be choked out by unbiblical views of virtue dont let the scenery and poetry and music of your relationship with god shrivel up and die you have the capacities for joy which you can scarcely imagine
585845 i have argued so far that disinterested benevolence toward god is evil if you come to god dutifully offering him the reward of your fellowship instead of thirsting after the reward of his fellowship then you exalt yourself above god as his benefactor and belittle him as a needy beneficiary and that is evil

585851 in mexico aids patients face two deaths one physical one social
585852 its a terrible shame that despite having medicine to detain the physical death in mexico and many parts of the world we must still endure a social death
585853 in mexico not all men who have sex with men consider themselves gay so they arent being reached by gay outreach organizations
585854 there is a whole cultural identity and stigma around the disease
585855 hiv and aids reproduce in a brutal way the stigmas and discrimination that are already present in mexican society

585869 after those bad outings i had i felt really like i wasnt contributing at all and felt like i was a burden on the team
585870 catcher russell martin did a lot of research on arizonas lineup and i just threw what he asked me to throw
585871 its good that my bullpen picked me up i cant throw every day so theyre going to have to pick it up on the days when i cant
585872 i mean its not like it was really weighing on my mind but you ask anybody when you get that first home run out of the way you start relaxing
585873 is an honorable and worthwhile pursuit the state department has conducted outreach to the wrong groups sending a terrible message to moderate muslims who are thoroughly disenfranchised by the funding hosting and embracing of radical groups that purport to be opposed to terrorism and extremism
585874 i know there are many in our community so desperate for peace that they want us to sweep under the rug the pro terrorism positions of some groups there are groups in the islamic world truly dedicated to peace but we should not blind ourselves to the fact that some are not
585875 if we are going to look at suspects we should look at groups that benefit the most from these kinds of incidents and i think we should put the state of israel on the suspect list

585932 they took their time until they had enough evidence to completely overwhelm ivins and they expected him to plead guilty
585933 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
585934 i just cannot see that bruce would in any way shape or form be responsible for something like that
585935 id like to see these charges substantiated because just like with dr hatfill there could be nothing to these allegations
585936 we were there processing information for agents and then one day they turned around and treated us all like suspects
585937 it is disturbing if that is true but i would like to see that clarified
585938 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
585939 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
585940 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
585941 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
585942 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
585943 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
585944 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

585956 stiamo cercando di capire il mondo reale non il web
585957 hey folks i wanted to let you know that new toolbar pagerank values should become visible over the next few days im expecting that also in the next few days that well be expiring some older penalties on websites
585958 volevo farvi sapere che i nuovi valori del pagerank sulla toolbar dovrebbero diventare visibili nei prossimi giorni
585959 update precedente il pagerank torna dunque ad aggiornarsi mostrando ancora una volta di saper catalizzare una notevole attenzione da parte di webmaster e seo il post di matt cutts ha generato fino ad ora oltre 240 commenti ed stato linkato da decine di forum e blog matt sa bene che i seo amano parlare del pagerank ecco infatti come autocommenta il suo post
585960 mi aspetto inoltre che nei prossimi giorni scadranno alcune vecchie penalizzazioni sui siti web
585961 i assume the penalties refer to the toolbar pagerank massacre that began about ten months ago for selling paid links
585962 google will be expiring some of the older pagerank penalities on websites
585963 no update to the way that new penalties are assessed just the expiration of some older ones
585964 at the discretion of the author a knol may include ads from our adsense program if an author chooses to include ads google will provide the author with a revenue share from the proceeds of those ad placements
585965 what if someone else has already written an article on that subject no problem you can still write your own article in fact the knol project is a forum for encouraging individual voices and perspectives on topics
585966 but that doesnt make us a media company we dont do our own content we get you to someone elses content faster
585967 inoltre google pu raccogliere informazioni sulle pagine web che visualizzi quando vengono attivate funzioni avanzate quali pagerank correttore ortografico e traduttore di parole
585968 in google toolbar 5 se cerchi di raggiungere un url inesistente la toolbar potrebbe inviare tale url a google per consentirci di aiutarti a trovare lurl che stai cercando
585969 alcune funzioni opzionali di google toolbar per il loro funzionamento richiedono linvio a google degli indirizzi o di altri dati sui siti quando vengono visitati
585970 le funzioni il cui funzionamento prevede linvio a google delle tue richieste di informazioni supplementari potrebbero inviare anche piccole quantit di dati a google nel momento in cui sono utilizzate

585973 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
585974 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
585975 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
585976 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
585977 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
585978 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
585979 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
585980 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
585981 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
585982 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
585983 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
585984 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
585985 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
585986 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
585987 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
585988 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
585989 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
585990 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
585991 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
585992 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
585993 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
585994 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
585995 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
585996 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
585997 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
585998 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
585999 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
586000 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

586012 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
586013 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
586014 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

586018 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
586019 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
586020 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
586021 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
586022 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
586023 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
586024 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
586025 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
586026 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
586027 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
586028 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
586029 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
586030 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
586031 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
586032 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
586033 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
586034 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
586035 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
586036 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
586037 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
586038 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
586039 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

586053 say goodbye to yellow pages sales staffs retool for the shift
586054 yellow pages publishers have spent the past three years transforming their massive on the ground sales forces into marketing consultants who can meet their customers demands both in print and online
586055 their combined print online packages are simple low priced one stop solutions to small business advertising needs
586056 are selling packages of ads in print at a much lower price point than the newspapers or broadcast tv or even radio guys so they know how to sell smaller ad packages to smaller business
586057 so theyre able to make the transition to online sales a lot more quickly as opposed to paper guys who are used to selling 50 000 or 100 000 packages its harder to get their attention on a 1 000 or 2 000 ad sale
586058 no new medium has ever come along and just killed off another one its always just transformed them

586181 very hot and dry i did not see any water anywhere no vegetation and just some nomads wandering around on camels its an inhospitable land to be sure with hardly any population
586182 no population heavens all i saw was people everywhere the city was so crowded i could barely move tall buildings underground transportation systems loud noises and humans definitely run earth are totally in charge and clearly the dominant species
586183 humans didnt see any at all actually whales dolphins coral beautiful blue water everywhere the eye could see clearly the aquatic creatures completely rule the planet a human couldnt even survive long in the water it was peaceful dark in some places and beautifully light in others
586184 there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy
586185 who is god oh yeah and where do we go when we die
586186 the lord is compassionate and gracious slow to anger and abounding in love he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities for as high as the heavens are above the earth so great is his love for those who fear him as far as the east is from the west so far has he removed our transgressions from us
586187 the eyes of god sought out a man after his own heart
586188 in this is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if god so loved us we also ought to love one another god abides in us and his love is perfected in us
586189 tea cups hold warm nourishment leaves hold droplets of water valleys hold a blanket of fog and now we can create our sacred vessels inspired by nature to hold what is dear to us in this workshop created especially for this autumnal rustic retreat we will look to the nature surrounding us at the beautiful six mile estate the woods water and sky and use what we observe as a jumping off point for the vessels we can later fill with our sacred treasures collected along the way using humble materials in an innovative and meditative way we will work forms from heavy wire and encase them using various techniques in a hardened skin of plaster gauze which we will then collage paint and distress to our hearts content we will explore form and construction and the various ways we can elevate the simple bowl form into snapshots of movement made still holding all the energy of the flap of a butterfly wing or the rocking of a fallen cracked nutshell these vessels will not only hold objects but also the energy of nature and the beautiful surrounding in which they were created

586193 but in the unlikely story that is america there has never been anything false about hope
586194 granting an evil calculated killer any kind of dispensation is criminal and leaves the judiciary with blood on its hands
586195 the decision to surrender to the appeal of this cold blooded murderer is nothing but unforgivable i urge you to do whatever is needed to reverse this travesty of justice
586196 to say that i and the 140 000 police officers i represent throughout england and wales are appalled and disgusted with the decision that david bieber will now not serve a whole life sentence is a gross understatement and my heart goes out to pc ian broadhursts family
586197 this is shockingly disrespectful to his memory and illustrates the utter travesty of our criminal justice system where the rights of a cop killer outweigh the rights of a fallen officers family friends and colleagues david bieber is a monster with no consideration for life
586198 the fact that his appeal was initially lodged on the grounds that it contravened his human rights is ludicrous he showed no mercy or concern for human rights when he ignored pc broadhursts appeal pleading for his life before being executed at point blank range
586199 they have asked me to log into the company web site everyday to look for an announcement for the joining date
586200 large companies have informed students that their joining date has been postponed to april may next year
586201 recruitment for 2009 the process for which starts in july august this year too has slowed down by almost 40 per cent there is definitely cautious hiring among the biggies like infosys and wipro
586202 we have always honoured all campus offers irrespective of the market conditions and this year is no different
586203 recruitment in iits too would be down by almost 20 25 per cent this year investment banks are some of the biggest recruiters there and as they are affected by the slowdown they would definitely lie low this year

586209 it was an exciting game they were base hits big plays and big moments all around
586210 you have to find a way to stay under control and not do too much
586211 it was great base running because thats not a normal sac fly ball for it to end like that is very interesting and strange
586212 weve had a few wins this year where weve pulled ourselves out of the fire but tonight was one of the better wins we had against a tough closer and one of the best starters in the game johan santana
586213 it wasnt a good feeling for a few seconds i got hit both ways i hit my thigh on the catcher and pence ran up my back it was a little whiplash but well worth it
586214 i was a little aggressive and it just so happened we were side by side as were coming into home
586215 i felt a little stronger than i was last start
586216 it takes me a little bit to get going but after i got going it was pretty good with santana out there i thought i might have given up too many runs
586217 you have to give most of the credit not necessarily to the bullpen but to the offense
586218 theyre battling against one of the top starters and top closers in the game
586219 we pulled out a win and all we had to do is to keep is close
586220 ja mia em wycofa si z ycia publicznego nawet z ycia literackiego a w zamian usa mia y wype ni swoje zobowi zania
586221 her first words were that she was very happy to see very nice people she was very pleased about that she was ecstatic
586222 we wanted to make sure rockefeller was outside the apartment to apprehend him outside away from his child was the best case scenario
586223 india is one of the biggest aid donors to afghanistan
586224 from a geopolitical and aid stand the issue for india will be about how to improve security as ties grow closer
586225 i am not expecting any dramatic shift in relations relations are as close as they can be
586226 but we may see a common hardening of their posture to pakistan and india may even announce more aid programs for afghanistan
586227 how about you sit up here on the way home
586228 young people say they dont scrapbook but everything they post online is an expression of themselves whether its a quote or lyrics or photos

586237 many earmarked projects considered by the agencies as low priority are being funded over higher priority non earmarked projects
586238 i was told i was going to train the iraqi army specifically on machine guns
586239 the only problem was it was a saudi dialect the iraq dialect is a little different
586240 the iraqi culture it is like the wind it is like the sand its no use getting mad about it you just have to learn how to deal with it
586241 they lived in this area and knew we couldnt get there
586242 when we detain suspects we treat them well we help people food medical operations help at schools we kill insurgents and we know the difference between insurgents and civilians
586243 we try to the best of our ability not to do their jobs
586244 im not really sure what happened but thats a done issue thats something that obviously people hear stuff im here practicing waiting and i obviously cant wait till the season starts
586245 im in a great frame of mind why wouldnt i be im with a new team a great bunch of guys im looking forward to getting this season on the road and actually looking forward to going into next week and try to put everything together as a team and as an offense
586246 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better
586247 were entirely ready to have god remove all these defects of character
586248 if the deal isnt done next week we will pull it and tommy will stay with us

586252 nixon was as good a poker player as if not better than anyone we had ever seen
586253 he played a quiet game but he was not afraid of taking chances he wasnt afraid of running a bluff sometimes the stakes were pretty big but nick had daring and a flair and knew what to do
586254 when the other hospitals in pittsburgh heard about it they adopted it
586255 the more i work on this the more i find out about the challenges they faced the roads they pioneered and the sacrifices they made
586256 the sisters of the holy family told me that on their time off they grew vegetables in the back of the hospital to feed the patients during the great depression
586257 despite what this looks like they told me they could get dressed in 15 minutes
586258 prior to that it was common for sisters to be burned out of their convents by people who thought they were trying to help the pope take over the country
586259 when their superiors came from greensburg and wanted to take them back to the motherhouse they elected to stay in johnstown and help out at the temporary hospital that had been set up
586260 the sister who gave them to me remembered giving them to patients
586261 we dont turn people away because they have money and we dont turn people away because they dont have money
586262 if its at all possible there would be sisters or staff or other residents to be with them and pray with them that still goes on
586263 the students were blown away they didnt realize that sisters were still around or that they were doing that kind of work
586264 they are still the pioneers they realize the need to do things that are not being taken care of
586265 once you have to choose between eating and fuel theres nothing greater than going back to the beginning and making your own
586266 with the way things are going it may be something a lot more people are realistically doing
586267 minimum standard of living necessary for health efficiency and general well being of workers
586268 clearly 2008 was one of the toughest years you could have to open something like market common and that covers everything
586269 you could go back to the early 90s before you could find a year that was as challenging a year to open market common
586270 its unusual to open this strong so we are extremely pleased
586271 we actually wanted to come to barnes amp noble so we looked up the closest one it was here
586272 we only take one real vacation a year so we try not to restrict ourselves too much
586273 if you look at past history the one thing that never really stopped during the great depression was movies people still went to the movies they want escapism theyve got to get away from the humdrum rigors of everyday life
586274 right above us theres three stories of condos and theyre renting those out and thats helped business a lot
586275 it hasnt made us want to go put our head in the sand yet
586276 we are opening the discussion about depression and mental illness and we hope that more people will feel free to get the help they need just talking about it can save lives
586277 the majority will respond to treatment but only one in three is actually getting treatment its a chemical problem and there are good treatments the majority of people who try to take their own life are affected by one or more mental disorders depression alcohol or substance abuse schizophrenia bipolar all of these carry a risk of suicide
586278 its such a taboo topic its such a huge thing but nobody talks about it theres this stigma my husband was an officer in the military had a great job and family nobody knows the pain they go through
586279 were very happy with the tremendous support from our community our sponsors have helped us so much the hospitals have been amazing with their unexpected support
586280 youre as old as you feel if you want to get old you get old if you dont you dont thats what i honestly think
586281 i think you can learn something every day if you want to
586282 you dont ever really think youre as old as you are
586283 you dont feel that old maybe if i was really bad off i might
586284 the worst thing was i had to give up my car
586285 but when youre by yourself you learn to keep that independence
586286 as a teenager i think they have a lot to worry about
586287 theres a lot of worries when youre younger i dont much worry anymore
586288 the war really ruled our lives for all those years
586289 we were married 50 years it was worth waiting for
586290 i died on the table and prayers brought me back
586291 it took me a year and a half to recover my husband supported me for 8 months when i was trying to talk and learn how to speak again
586292 were trying to get people to understand that theres a stigma attached to depression and mental illness that doesnt need to be there
586293 warning signs with depression would be loss of interest in their usual activities or withdrawal from social activities and changes in appetite or sleep
586294 i wish everybody would listen to me i survived and you will too
586295 i havent seen anything that tells me it alters the brain chemistry
586296 i havent seen anything that tells me there are real physiological negative ramification from using the internet
586297 its more in like the impulse control category like kleptomania or people who set fires non specified and thats kind of a catch all tv addiction fits in there too
586298 conceptually the diagnosis is a compulsive impulsive spectrum disorder that involves online and or offline computer usage and consists of three subtypes excessive gaming sexual preoccupations and e mail text messaging
586299 these compulsive behaviors can have very serious health and social consequences ranging from fatigue depression social isolation and poor work performance
586300 in some very extreme cases those addicted to internet use have suffered cardiopulmonary related deaths
586301 about 80 percent of those needing treatment may need psychotropic medications and perhaps 20 to 24 percent require hospitalization
586302 unlike in asia where internet cafes are frequently used in the united states games and virtual sex are accessed at home
586303 attempts to measure the phenomenon are clouded by shame denial and minimization
586304 they may be the same people who previously before the internet made contact via telephone to others many times a day
586305 as the internet becomes even more commonplace and affordable more people will have the opportunity to develop an addiction to viewing the internet
586306 i have heard that it can also become quite problematic particularly when pornography is involved and its a substitute for intimacy because the individual who is involved in a relationship because they have his real intimate connection with the other person
586307 my personal belief is if you spend 20 hours behind a computer and not interacting or talking to people youre not going to develop the nonverbal communication skills that is so much in the interaction between people
586308 i think people can stunt their ability to interact appropriately with other people
586309 but doing those things at home without pushing yourself to leave actually worsens it for the folk who are on that path
586310 but if there wasnt any of that stuff there and if it was really troublesome to them you could do one or two things you could do psychotherapy to help set limits and then probably consider some medication for impulse control disorders
586311 i dont have anything to back this up but personally i believe a lot of people blame addiction for a lot of societys ills
586312 internet addiction and pornography addiction and texting addiction and that stuff is really taking it a bit too far in my opinion
586313 aber ich sehe einige zeitabschnitte da ist es nur eine spur und wenn ich richtig nachdenke waren das die zeiten wo ich mich allein f hlte wo ich zweifelte wo ich probleme hatte wo warst du da
586314 ten years ago companies would call up and say i need a digital strategy
586315 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
586316 consider this the world produces about 85 million barrels of oil a day but global demand now tops 86 million barrels a day the u s uses nearly a quarter of the worlds oil with just 4 percent of the worlds population and 3 percent of the worlds reserves
586317 we need to look at all options recognizing that there is no silver bullet
586318 every couple of years we hear that a horse died from eating it
586319 locoweed tastes like alfalfa and once horses get a taste of it theyll keep eating it
586320 work a small area at a time so you dont get overwhelmed
586321 you want to stress the root so it uses up its nutrients and dies
586322 when youre 16 you get to watch nc 16 films
586323 it is not enough for the believer to begin to pray nor to pray correctly nor is it enough to continue for a time to pray we must patiently believingly continue in prayer until we obtain an answer further we have not only to continue in prayer until the end but we have also to believe that god does hear us and will answer our prayers most frequently we fail in not continuing in prayer until the blessing is obtained and in not expecting the blessing those who are disciples of the lord jesus should labor with all their might in the work of god as if everything depended upon their own endeavors yet having done so they should not in the least trust in their labor and efforts nor in the means that they use for the spread of the truth but in god alone and they should with all earnestness seek the blessing of god in persevering patient and believing prayer here is the great secret of success my christian reader work with all your might but never trust in your work pray with all your might for the blessing in god but work at the same time with all diligence with all patience with all perseverance pray then and work work and pray and still again pray and then work and so on all the days of your life the result will surely be abundant blessing whether you see much fruit or little fruit such kind of service will be blessed
586324 we are very disappointed a new offer has not been made because we did expect to hear from the government about pay negotiations and an improved funding model
586325 there are lots of reasons for moving and obviously some are human and some are divine
586326 but first and foremost we feel weve outgrown our facility
586327 the nice thing for us is that generally thats when our student population isnt there
586328 anything you can think of being in a normal church will have to be there on sunday mornings
586329 were trying to think of any way imaginable to put the word out
586330 we are thinking like this is a temporary move with long term implications
586331 eventually wed like to get our own space but we want to see if this works for us and for our congregation
586332 what was your position i forget you were a sex therapist
586333 lets see um i used to know god what is it what is it gee whiz
586334 well what i remember most was working with men with impotence
586335 do you have a copy of that so i remember
586336 more often family are willing to take in women needing help than men
586337 its more than a community its like a family cause a lot of these people theyve been here for long periods of time
586338 ive been here since they crucified christ no im just joking i came here in 1997
586339 without the volunteers these organizations are dead in the water
586340 with all the soup kitchen stuff the food and all the people are all volunteered the people who work down here at the center are obviously all volunteers so in terms of the value its probably a million dollars worth of service provided every year for the centers 100 000 operating budget
586341 we do have a fighting chance to get into platinum but at that level you fight for every point which basically means they cost significantly
586342 so our hope is either well be firmly in gold or in platinum which would be pretty huge there are very few platinum buildings in the world
586343 it makes very real financial and practical sense as well as larger spiritual sense
586344 environmental values are imbedded in jewish tradition it goes back to the torah it goes back to genesis it goes back to god creating a world thats in perfect balance and then giving it to human beings to take care of
586345 i think not just in judaism but in western religion tradition in general the notion that the world does not belong to us is sort of a foundational value that the world is ours to take care of but not ours to exploit
586346 its starting to become a part of the ethos of our congregation and thats exciting
586347 a lot of people we have to divide the groups
586348 weve gone through a lot of hurdles from the city of evanston
586349 this is a little bit diversified the thought process we have
586350 its not only that were going to pray or were going to worship but also were going to contribute to the community
586351 we are taking the initiative thats all were trying to do
586352 we are hoping that its going to be for everybody that everybody is going to walk in
586353 i heard that it had been bought but i didnt know what it was about
586354 i know i saw people over there but i didnt know what they were going to be using it for
586355 breathing in i calm my body breathing out i smile
586356 when we can open our heart to love more deeply and to accept more fully we then get beyond the illusion that were all separate that were different that theres something wrong with someone else
586357 and we can begin to really have an awareness that were all connected
586358 if people can experience faith in a different way than what they are used to then thats a beautiful thing
586359 it looked like something proactive to do and it seemed like a wonderful way to spend a saturday morning
586360 and with the state of the world today it makes you want to do something in your own little way
586361 the way we present this experience will be of such a caliber and a power that it really will resonate with the visitor and stay with them forever
586362 that i believe is a standard that the u s museum has set theyve set the bar very high as it should be and i hope we will equal that and be seen as a real complement to whats already done in washington
586363 once we get into a regular pattern most of our visitors will not be jewish or may not have even met a jewish person in their life
586364 so part of our responsibility will be to help them understand that jewish people lived and worked and played and prayed and went about everyday life as families so much the same way we all do today i think if we can present that show what life was like we can help each visitor see all that was taken away and all that was lost
586365 it really creates a way for visitors to find a local connection to see that this could be your neighbor or someone walking down the street
586366 from the history of the holocaust we can learn lessons to teach us against hatred and intolerance and indifference
586367 when you live in a world where those still exist we cant continue to say never again and not educate about other holocausts that are happening never again needs to be today not just something that we say
586368 im not looking for attention im looking for a really cool shirt
586369 it is hypothesized that subconsciously atypical theft offenders are very angry and steal because they want someone else to feel the unfair loss that they are feeling since this is a subconscious act in partnership with deep subconscious anger cupchik 1997
586370 please the burden of my loss is so very heavy that i cant manage it on my own can you lose something with me
586371 youre a little premature to talk about that call me back in about two weeks
586372 young people say they dont scrapbook but everything they post online is an expression of themselves whether its a quote or lyrics or photos
586373 i see quilts as not only a visualization tool but as a way to create identity sense of community advocacy legitimacy and to give voice to the voiceless
586374 why are you doing this anyway you stink at it
586375 the day me and my wife first came in here ken was back behind the back counter cutting steaks and i said ken how would you like to sell this place
586376 woolstenhulmes forbearers helped settle the kamas valley and ken a lifelong resident has served as oakleys mayor and lds bishop among other positions he also has been a member of the south summit school board and sits on the summit county commission
586377 karen raised the kids here all five of our kids grew up here
586378 when you come in here you know the people at the counter you know who prepared the salsa they have really good salsa and ken would give you a special cut of meat
586379 and you just catch up with the people who live here
586380 kens kash is as much a part of our tradition as going to the cabin
586381 some of the stuff is funny and some of it isnt
586382 i lecture at colleges and i tell them all the time as early as you can find out what you like to do and then you dont really have to work
586383 were not in the business of doing textbooks but i think comic books really do have the great potential to inform and teach
586384 are we there yet the golden age of american family vacations
586385 is all happening in an area of the mammalian brain that takes care of most basic functions like eating drinking eye movements all at an unconscious level and i dont think anyone expected this part of the brain to be so specialized
586386 you can always tell who the pioneers are theyre the ones with all the arrows sticking out of their backs
586387 even though they the sec would never admit it patrick byrne helped instruct them in the danger when the time came they understood the threat
586388 what i dont understand is why the sec is only addressing fannie mae freddie mac and the large investment banks why should those companies be the only ones protected
586389 we know it has been going on and that its been harmful to share prices
586390 one of the big concerns we have is that depositors often can not distinguish the difference between a stock price dropping and the safety of their deposits and soundness of their bank
586391 rather than fixing any of the real problems with the agency and its mission cox and his fellow commissioners waved a newspaper and swatted the imaginary fly of naked short selling it made a big noise but theres no dead bug
586392 byrne has said that the secs politically motivated pandering means that he has won the intellectual argument on naked short selling
586393 but there hasnt been an intellectual argument there has been a campaign of intimidation and personal attacks against critics of his poor management of his company and his naked shorting jihad
586394 what theyre saying is that if he only ran a better liquor store he wouldnt get robbed as much
586395 then she mentioned about how shed read about all the horrible things i was doing and how it appeared like id gone completely off the deep end
586396 as we sat down he said patrick i want you to know that you have become the most hated man ive ever known in all my life here in new york
586397 when i think of what might happen to the financial system as a result of all of this it just makes me sick there is no joy in being right
586398 maybe he just never knew how much he was loved
586399 never be able to make sense of what it was steven saw
586400 there are cognitive cultural and social dimensions to the human paper dynamic that come into play every time any kind of paper from a tiny post it note to a groaning sunday newspaper is used to convey retrieve or store information
586401 paper does these jobs in a way that pleases us which is why for centuries we have liked having it around its also why we will never give it up as a medium
586402 the book you place on your nightstand as you drift off to sleep will be exactly the same book when you wake up in the morning
586403 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
586404 more homes that is what that picture needs more retaining walls and more homes
586405 a lot of people regardless of race continue to have very unsophisticated views of the media
586406 and many african americans in particular are still very distrustful of the media

586412 has done a clever job of keeping in the flavor and phrasing of austens work intact and ann kapp andersens music is dramatic and beautiful
586413 hubbard had earlier engaged in modest embellishments of his personal history but the exaggerations flowered luxuriantly during his second year at gwu
586414 the editor of the literary supplement during hubbards final semester at gwu was paul linebarger two years younger but a year ahead of him in school another member of the literary supplements staff has told me that hubbard and linebarger soon became intensely competitive toward each other linebarger made good grades wrote as fluently as hubbard and was equally ambitious linebarger held a major advantage in their bragging sessions he really had traveled extensively by himself not only in china but in russia he really had studied the classics of oriental wisdom and sat at the feet of chinese sages including the great sun yat sen linebarger had also conducted a passionate romance in peking with an exiled white russian woman several years his senior had narrowly survived a suicide pact with her and had participated directly in high level secret negotiations between the u s and chinese governments all before he was 18 further linebarger was not above adding a bit of embroidery to these genuine experiences to make them even more colorful is it any wonder that ron hubbard might thereupon dramatically expand the scope and drama of his own exaggerations simply in order to stay competitive and is it any wonder that when such exaggerations appeared to gain acceptance hubbard would try more of the same in the future
586415 washington times articles are routinely cited by c span for instance without explanations to viewers that the newspaper is financed by an ultra right religious cult leader a convicted tax fraud and a publicly identified money launderer
586416 its an oversimplification to say that sf deals with the consequences of the industrial revolution while fantasy denies the industrial revolution ever took place
586417 its an oversimplification to say that sf deals with the consequences of the industrial revolution while fantasy denies the industrial revolution ever took place but its an oversimplification with a grain of truth at its heart
586418 its less a question of saying this is how the universe works ted said

586421 d c meltdown congress dragging feet on radioactive waste ban
586422 we were so impressed with the beauty of park city salt lake city and utah in general
586423 its hard to be there and not be inspired were looking forward to getting back to that environment
586424 its great to travel around together because we have a good time hanging out together even if its not related to music we actually enjoy each others company
586425 one of our goals is to break down walls and misconceptions about classical music or any style of music
586426 there are various ways music is categorized and those barriers are kind of artificial we try to present programs that have all kinds of different styles
586427 we dont like to be pigeonholed and were open to just about anything
586428 if it sounds good if it works and if its something we all believe in were going to play it
586429 after you hear the note it begins to fade away
586430 it wont sustain like the human voice or a bowed or wind instrument
586431 i dont feel anything was lost in translation when the piece was transferred to guitars
586432 being able to play that beautiful melody with a little vibrato arguably enhances it its a different way to experience the piece
586433 so were dependent on playing in a room that has nice acoustics st marys has beautiful acoustics
586434 here at st marys if you look out the windows youre looking at the mountains
586435 it always seems to fit with the music thats played here
586436 there were several amazing concerts during that time but salt lake city sticks out in my mind
586437 since 9 11 ive had a special connection with salt lake city
586438 most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid 20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations
586439 wed all hang out after the show and order steaks and sandwiches and james would order a plain chicken breast and vegetables
586440 i remember thinking this friendship is never going to work but it did
586441 more than once while we were shooting pineapple express we said to each other who wouldve thought when we were doing the show that one day someone would actually be paying us to make a movie
586442 with all of those guys its just mad bro love
586443 he just had this loose notion of wanting to do what he called a weed action movie me and evan thought that could be rad and basically we started thinking about making a movie that would be kind of a weed movie kind of an action movie and kind of a story about friendship we basically tried to write what would be our favorite movie ever
586444 a rollercoaster ride of fun there was no drama whatsoever both seth and james have it down for them its about working with friends and having a good time
586445 we also looked at early coen brothers movies such as millers crossing and raising arizona which are really violent
586446 and we were inspired by anything with brian bosworth in it anything with an ex football player turned actor in it were big fans of that
586447 one day i said to judd you know it would be crazy if we could get huey lewis to do a song for this for some reason i thought that would be something unattainable but it was way easier than youd think
586448 two days later we had a song from huey lewis
586449 its just so much fun for me to watch kung fu panda and think that some dork in san francisco spent 1 600 man hours animating my whiskers i get a kick out of that
586450 more of a romantic comedy than a look at the porn industry
586451 basically we live in a world where on screen you can disembowel someone in a youth hostel in romania but you cant show people pretending to have sex
586452 its an unexplored area weve actually been trying to write a movie about a hero and his sidekick for years and then when we heard that the green hornet movie was up for grabs we thought it could be the most perfect way to do this story
586453 weve basically found a way to do a friendship story buried inside a big crazy action movie
586454 learning style is used in a variety of ways in the teaching and learning process general
586455 i havent done a proper solo tour in the states for five years
586456 people have an affection for the flamboyance of those videos
586457 its a good feeling to play the hits but its also good to play new songs
586458 i wont be doing anything from fumbling unless the power goes out

586460 we are going to do exactly what we did at the last meet and then go home and watch the olympics on t v like everyone else
586461 people will get to experience a bit of each one
586462 this is the kind of gilbert amp sullivan audience that knows all the words and there are thousands of people like that and theyre so excited about the show that they just join in
586463 it will be fun for one night to bring all the shows together
586464 its kind of like a sorbet to cleanse the palate before we start the next cycle
586465 there are still a few g amp s shows that havent been done here
586466 people come from all over the world for mikado we had some people from london for gondoliers there were people from japan to see these shows performed with opera singers is unusual for this repertoire people here are pretty lucky to have it in their backyard and were lucky to be here
586467 i think weve gotten to the point packers rb grant agree to extension

586469 cyberbullying is much worse because you cannot see the bully and its a 24 7 thing you cant get away from it
586470 schools are struggling with this issue because youre dealing with a students private space but they know they cant just ignore cyberbullying
586471 we are seeing school systems address this problem in various educational programs and those will continue to grow in number and in content
586472 if you shaved his face and put a hat on
586473 there is no reason to believe this is anything other than a failure of our infrastructure
586474 so we are treating these materials sent up by the rupture including piping as if asbestos were in them
586475 you know what i thought when i first saw you i thought you were beautiful
586476 while i am sympathetic to your situation i am not satisfied that these circumstances justify granting an exemption in the opinion of a medical officer this health condition might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demand on health and social services
586477 might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demand on health and social services
586478 my husband and i are very grateful to canada it was been our wish to have an opportunity to start a better future here this decision has a big impact on my health in a positive way it makes me more powerful in fighting the illness i have
586479 but what shall we substitute in its place you say
586480 i am not afraid and am always ready to do my duty but i would like some one to tell me what we are fighting for
586481 this machine has an official record of killing 31 men 1901
586482 so we have to be frog princess we cant be just normal princess
586483 on the one hand alzheimers disease is a complex pathologic process and that is daunting
586484 but now we are beginning to segregate out different therapeutic targets and develop drugs that have an impact on each target so in combination they may handle the disease better than any single approach
586485 we established the association but when it comes to explaining it we can only speculate at this state
586486 if you are looking for interventions to prevent alzheimers one way may be to identify people who have been divorced or widowed and who havent adapted or gotten back into the social circle and give them support with the aim of giving them new structure and social networks in their lives
586487 im not really sure what happened but thats a done issue thats something that obviously people hear stuff im here practicing waiting and i obviously cant wait till the season starts
586488 im in a great frame of mind why wouldnt i be im with a new team a great bunch of guys im looking forward to getting this season on the road and actually looking forward to going into next week and try to put everything together as a team and as an offense
586489 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better

586502 they had strife with north korea luckily nothing major happened
586503 theres always going to be anxiety with the political thing at the olympics
586504 i hope they lay that stuff aside for the 2 1 2 weeks
586505 i think its ridiculous they mix politics and the olympics but this is a world stage so some people want to use that to make a statement
586506 what happens if a couple athletes win their medals and use that opportunity
586507 i guess it depends on how much attention it draws its not like the chinese have a lot of experience in sanctioning protests
586508 in some ways whats going on with these games is very similar to whats gone on in many games
586509 china is the emerging power of the 21st century and they have spent 40 billion to promote these games
586510 its kind of like fanny mae and freddie mac theyre too big as organizations to fail china is more concerned about the domestic impact of these games than they are the foreign impact
586511 they have invested more in building a sport power than any nation has invested before
586512 sport provides that kind of psychological lift that we in pittsburgh know about
586513 its a great experience to be around athletes from a hundred other countries all in one place
586514 just seeing some of the elite athletes standing in the dinner line with tennis great steffi graff or being around a guy who was my hero british decathlete daley thompson just brushing shoulders with him and seeing him walking down the street or being there with big name swimmers matt biondi janet evans michael gross
586515 its pretty much my only shot so i dont really care
586516 standing in the infield after racing you look at lights and they had a halo around them
586517 your eyes feel like when you climb out of a pool with too much chlorine
586518 ill wear it at all times normally when im not racing
586519 if the dodgers want me to finish my career here or whatever were going to sit down and were going to talk
586520 just being back in competition is the most exciting part about being back i like the anticipation of having a good season
586521 the hardest part last year was missing the travel and competition with the team you have chemistry and so many little things you miss out on ill have to work to make up for some of what i missed
586522 we just need to get the team on the same page we have to make the right adjustments and relieve some of their anxiety
586523 i think our blocking and serve receive is pretty decent
586524 i believe the physical aspects are there but the time to tell if they will be is monday
586525 all the tension is there when you see lobos on one side of the court and mavericks on the other

586536 the truth must be kept secret and the masses need a teaching proportioned to their imperfect reason
586537 every mans conception of god must be proportioned to his mental cultivation and intellectual powers and moral excellence god is as man conceives him the reflected image of man himself
586538 the true name of satan the kabalists say is that of yahveh reversed for satan is not a black god but the negation of god the devil is the personification of atheism or idolatry
586539 not only were many of the founders of the united states government masons but they received aid from a secret and august body existing in europe which helped them to establish this country for a peculiar and particular purpose known only to the initiated few the great seal is the signature of this exalted body unseen and for the most part unknown and the unfinished pyramid upon its reverse side is a trestleboard setting forth symbolically the task to the accomplishment of which the united states government was dedicated from the day of its inception
586540 the day has come when fellow craftsman must know and apply their knowledge the lost key to their grade is the mastery of emotion which places the energy of the universe at their disposal man can only expect to be entrusted with great power by proving his ability to use it constructively and selflessly when the mason learns that the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power he has learned the mystery of his craft the seething energies of lucifer are in his hands and before he may step onward and upward he must prove his ability to properly apply energy he must follow in the footsteps of his forefather tubal cain who with the mighty strength of the war god hammered his sword into a plowshare

586544 avifnon illuminati of illumines davignon a rite instituted by pernetti at avignon in france
586545 concordists a secret order established in prussia by m lang on the wreck of the tugendverein which later body was instituted in 1790 as a successor of the illuminati and suppressed in 1812 by the prussian government on account of its supposed political tendencies
586546 illuminati this is a latin word signifying the enlightened and hence often applied in latin diplomas as an epithet of freemasons
586547 so large a body of men could be found uniting rare energy with execrable vice political madness and outrageous cruelty committed always in the name of virtue
586548 the division of the ten sephiroth into three triads was arranged into a form called by kabbalists the kabbalistic tree or the tree of life as shown in the preceding diagram
586549 figure largely amongst all the secret societies of modern times and naturally so for these illuminati have borrowed without understanding it the phraseology of the kabbalists and the valentinians
586550 contribution towards the latest history of the order of freemasons

586563 sandi you are my closest friend and you have always been there for me in times of need both personally and professionally
586564 take a portion of the windfall profits from big oil and put 1 000 in the pockets of working families
586565 forcing big oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to help struggling families with direct relief
586566 a down payment on obamas long term plan to provide middle class families with at least 1 000 per year in permanent tax relief
586567 obama simply asks that big oil companies contribute a reasonable share of the windfall profits they receive from high oil prices over the next five years to pay for emergency assistance for families right now
586568 the higher taxes that barack obama supports are one of the surest ways to kill jobs and exactly the wrong approach to a slowing economy
586569 while american jobs and families suffer from high gas prices barack obama stubbornly opposes additional oil drilling more nuclear power and the gas tax relief we need
586570 as we help to reduce the burden of rising energy prices
586571 barack obama believes it is important not to abandon our commitment to long term fiscal discipline
586572 while oil companies and shareholders need incentives to run well managed businesses that invest in efficiency and innovation a significant share of the record profits the big oil companies have been making have nothing to do with their management skill it is the result of changes in the price of oil because of factors like supplies in the middle east demand in asia and disruptions and distortions in the oil market
586573 i kinda have this special party i have to go to for my cousin shawn plus gambling isnt necessarily a good thing but its not like a major crime
586574 you promised you would help me besides gambling is a major crime especially if its like unregulated like what if its a rigged set up where people are just set up to lose think of the financial stress people are in in the recession and who knows what other illegal side activities theyre doing plus im really wondering about that weird guy who comes to my work every so often he hasnt been in for awhile
586575 yeah im all right i didnt even get a bruise or scratch
586576 hey sammy i think this is the place were looking for
586577 hey i just thought you might want to know that a couple of punks are tagging the back of your building i think they even said the fatso will never get us anyway
586578 oh its all right dear accidents happen im new to this town and my mind just isnt all together
586579 well it would be nice if you ladies could give me a nice tour of the town for the next few days if you dont mind itd be great to have a local show me around a bit to help me get familiar to the area
586580 its the least we can do since sammy knocked you down
586581 they have discovered water on mars for the third or fourth time

586583 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
586584 she was covered in soot she was black all over
586585 she was so much about being one with the world and mother nature and there was a certain amount of understanding in her that you could see behind her eyes
586586 why dont you go get some warm clothes and well take a walk
586587 hrc is proud to throw our full support behind senator obamas presidential campaign
586588 senator obama has consistently shown that he understands as we do that glbt rights are civil rights and human rights senator obama has said that embracing our gay brothers and sisters is true to martin luther kings vision i know that senator obamas vision is one of equality fairness and justice for all of us
586589 we have just witnessed a historic primary contest in which two champions of our community demonstrated that they hear our voices and share our dreams for millions across this country their candidacies as the first woman and the first african american to be top contenders for the nomination of a major party have already been life changing inspiring and groundbreaking senators obama and clinton both remained our allies whether they were campaigning in new mexico or nebraska in california or kansas they are quite simply heroes to anyone fighting for equality
586590 the human rights campaign has been at the forefront of the fight for glbt equality and opportunity and i am proud to have its endorsement
586591 too often the issue of glbt rights is exploited by those seeking to divide us but at its core this issue is about who we are as americans i look forward to working with hrc to end discrimination against glbt americans and to ensure that all of our citizens are treated with dignity and respect
586592 in this area we must balance all reasonable conclusions with evidence that is backed up by proper statistical studies personally when i want to structure an argument regarding national media marketing i look to the studies and conclusions of bard kutchar who was a pioneer in the field and highly regarded statistician
586593 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
586594 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options

586603 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
586604 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
586605 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
586606 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
586607 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
586608 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
586609 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed

586617 celebro que la presidenta haya vuelto a hablar con los medios de prensa elogi el jefe de gobierno porte o mauricio macri pro sin embargo le falt autocr tica a lo largo de toda la conferencia no hizo menci n ni a los cambios de funcionarios como moreno que la sociedad reclama como tampoco se refiri o lo hizo someramente acerca de temas muy importantes como la inflaci n la grave situaci n de la provincia de c rdoba los discursos del campo en la rural o la realidad de aerol neas argentinas
586618 la presidenta no dio cuenta de los problemas centrales del pa s tambi n defendi lo hecho en el indec sostuvo sin novedades en el gabinete sin novedades respecto a lo sucedido con el conflicto del campo sin novedades en relaci n a moreno y sin novedades respecto a la inflaci n
586619 estamos en el peor de los mundos cristina no hace m s que ratificar lo peor de su gobierno la manipulaci n de las cifras del indec a moreno y al tren bala pero a la vez niega la inflaci n la crisis energ tica y los problemas fiscales tampoco se hace cargo de la inseguridad
586620 no tuvo definiciones y es grave que haya ratificado que no va a haber cambios en su gabinete y en su pol tica de gobierno
586621 es incomprensible que la presidenta siga sin reconocer a la inflaci n como uno de los principales problemas de la poblaci n no hay dudas que la ratificaci n del gabinete implica la continuidad de pol ticas que han fracasado rotundamente como lo es la antiinflacionaria
586622 no se va moreno no cambia el indec no estuvo mal la resoluci n 125 se equivocaron los que piensan distinto el tema de los superpoderes del jefe de gabinete est superado cambi la forma pero no el fondo una conferencia de prensa pero sin anuncios

586655 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
586656 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
586657 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
586658 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
586659 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
586660 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
586661 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
586662 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
586663 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
586664 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
586665 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
586666 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
586667 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
586668 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
586669 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us

586695 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
586696 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
586697 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
586698 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
586699 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
586700 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
586701 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
586702 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
586703 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
586704 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
586705 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
586706 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
586707 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
586708 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
586709 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
586710 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
586711 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
586712 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
586713 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
586714 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
586715 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
586716 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
586717 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
586718 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
586719 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
586720 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
586721 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
586722 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
586723 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
586724 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
586725 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
586726 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
586727 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
586728 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
586729 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
586730 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
586731 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
586732 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
586733 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
586734 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
586735 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
586736 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
586737 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
586738 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
586739 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
586740 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
586741 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
586742 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
586743 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
586744 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
586745 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
586746 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
586747 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
586748 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
586749 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
586750 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
586751 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
586752 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
586753 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
586754 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
586755 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
586756 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
586757 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
586758 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
586759 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
586760 were not going to do it with the democrats saying well get around to it someday
586761 if none of us have breaking points none of us have a moral compass
586762 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
586763 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
586764 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
586765 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
586766 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
586767 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
586768 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
586769 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
586770 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
586771 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
586772 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
586773 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
586774 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
586775 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
586776 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
586777 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
586778 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
586779 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
586780 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
586781 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
586782 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
586783 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
586784 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies
586785 anti flag anti family criminal rights welfare traitors endanger bizarre radical sick corrupt
586786 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
586787 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
586788 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
586789 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
586790 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
586791 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
586792 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
586793 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
586794 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
586795 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
586796 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
586797 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
586798 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
586799 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
586800 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
586801 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
586802 he also has special jowls and a big dewlap right here a double chin which he puffs up with air
586803 he gets high on his haunches and starts bobbing his head and thats a territorial movement to scare other males away
586804 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
586805 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
586806 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
586807 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
586808 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
586809 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
586810 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
586811 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
586812 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
586813 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
586814 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
586815 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
586816 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
586817 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
586818 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
586819 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
586820 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
586821 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
586822 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
586823 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
586824 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
586825 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
586826 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
586827 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
586828 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
586829 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
586830 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
586831 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
586832 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
586833 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
586834 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
586835 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
586836 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
586837 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
586838 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
586839 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
586840 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
586841 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
586842 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
586843 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
586844 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
586845 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
586846 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
586847 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
586848 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
586849 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
586850 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
586851 if the vice president says its do able i believe
586852 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
586853 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
586854 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
586855 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
586856 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
586857 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
586858 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
586859 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
586860 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
586861 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
586862 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
586863 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
586864 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
586865 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
586866 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
586867 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
586868 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
586869 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
586870 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
586871 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
586872 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
586873 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
586874 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
586875 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
586876 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
586877 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
586878 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
586879 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
586880 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
586881 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
586882 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
586883 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
586884 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
586885 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
586886 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
586887 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
586888 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
586889 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
586890 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
586891 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
586892 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
586893 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
586894 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
586895 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
586896 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
586897 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
586898 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
586899 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
586900 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
586901 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
586902 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
586903 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
586904 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
586905 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
586906 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
586907 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
586908 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
586909 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
586910 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
586911 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
586912 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
586913 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
586914 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
586915 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
586916 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
586917 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
586918 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
586919 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
586920 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
586921 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
586922 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
586923 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
586924 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
586925 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
586926 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
586927 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
586928 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
586929 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
586930 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
586931 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
586932 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
586933 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
586934 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
586935 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
586936 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
586937 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
586938 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
586939 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
586940 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
586941 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
586942 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
586943 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
586944 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
586945 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
586946 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
586947 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
586948 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
586949 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
586950 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
586951 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
586952 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
586953 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
586954 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
586955 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
586956 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
586957 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
586958 she was so much about being one with the world and mother nature and there was a certain amount of understanding in her that you could see behind her eyes
586959 facilities to be provided to passengers by airlines due to delay denied boarding and cancellation
586960 with the introduction of a large number of air operators and the ensuing competition among them to provide cheaper services it is likely that the interest of fare paying passenger is ignored and is denied certain basic rights a number of complaints are received by the ministry of civil aviation and dgca from the passengers against the treatment meted out by airlines this car is aimed at providing regulations in the interest of travelling passengers and the minimum facilities which must be provided to them

586963 although gushan has not received any suspension or shut down notice from the prc government we believe that the governments recent strict enforcement of measures controlling the movement of vehicles and goods in and out of the beijing area have rendered biodiesel production at our beijing plant impractical for the time being we expect to resume biodiesel production at our beijing plant after september 20

586967 as a number three batsmen i have got to score runs and in this series what have i got
586968 i have had some good balls and a little bit of bad luck
586969 but i set myself a lot of high standards and in this series i have not got anywhere near those standards so i want to look at that and make sure i get back to playing like i can
586970 you have to deliver out in the middle i am an experienced player and at the minute i am not delivering so i will have to come up with a formula to give myself the best chance to deliver when the pressure is on
586971 let the dust settle because emotions always run high after defeats like this
586972 its the first time i have ever lost back to back games and i am more gutted than anyone because midway through the day i expected us to bowl them out for 200 and win quite comfortably
586973 definitely i think the cricketing gods can sometimes make it hard work
586974 he started the second innings really well obviously massively up for the game and then played a pretty good looking shot and was caught inches off the ground by the guy at extra cover
586975 sometimes the game can be like that youve got to ride that through youve got to back yourself keep your belief weve got to support him and hes got to move on
586976 the way he came out and played and chased down that target was as good an innings as i have ever seen under that sort of pressure
586977 we threw everything at them we had that flurry of wickets in the afternoon and we just felt we were going to get wickets consistently and blow them away
586978 its possible to learn the habits of learning these things dont just happen in high school they need to be slowly learned
586979 the primary years are an academic apprenticeship not only in the basic skills of literacy and numeracy but also bodily skills of application to work and independence in learning its not about turning kids into homework robots but teaching them to apply themselves to their work
586980 there are actually many positives to being in social groups during the teen years
586981 social groups provide a sense of community and support this is where many people find their life long friends these groups also teach basic social skills such as negotiation compromise teamwork and communication
586982 in social groups members are free to socialize and hang out with others outside the group without worrying about being cast out they may not do everything together and thats ok
586983 theres a fine line between being a helicopter parent who hovers over their child and makes every decision for them and being an involved parent who allows their children to make mistakes and recognize that those are places and opportunities to grow
586984 its not the end of the world if your child is not invited to a sleepover or if somebody says something ugly to your child these are in fact opportunities for your child to grow in character
586985 she got strict instructions she was told to only have a little bit of orange juice and a big coffee in the morning which would make her go to the bathroom
586986 then she was told to keep sucking down coffee all day until at least 3 p m when she could eat lettuce with a tiny bit of tuna with a drop of mayo
586987 dinner is a tiny square of broiled fish about 2 inches long and a glass of wine
586988 its just a first date prescribes that you play to win that means that even though a first date isnt a big deal you should still be on your game and try
586989 the first date is either a beginning or ending but what happens next you only know how the date went for you and his impression of the night might be totally different from yours

587007 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day

587090 todav a hay que hacer los estudios en principio parece ser una distensi n en la rodilla as que esperaremos unas horas para realizar los ex menes por la evaluaci n que hicieron los m dicos creen que no hay nada grave y que no sea nada del ligamento
587091 fue una jugada donde quedo enganchando con un jugador de cruz azul riveros y cuando me quiero levantar l se me cae encima y yo sent que la rodilla se fue para adentro intent correr en el costado del terreno de juego pero ya sent la rodilla muy floja y con dolor no era tanto el dolor sino que estaba inestable la rodilla
587092 en pocos minutos pasaron muchas cosas lamentablemente no jugaron en nuestro favor ahora no hay que desesperarse y asumir de la mejor manera lo que viene no nos deja contento esto hay que poner el pecho y salir adelante
587093 hay que seguir trabajando y eso de mala noche queda a criterio de ustedes pero bueno hay que seguir trabajando pero de todos modos hay que hablar lo del rbitro que es muy quisquilloso en las decisiones contra atlas hoy fue la segunda vez hoy no perdimos por el rbitro eso no tiene nada que ver pero s sufrimos la expulsi n de un jugador importante y tambi n en la lesi n de vargas que hay que analizar la mala intenci n de riveros que no tengo dudas que fue con mala intenci n
587094 demasiado premio para cruz azul y sin quitarle m rito creo que nosotros estando 2 1 tuvimos oportunidades para abultar la diferencia creo que tuvimos errores colectivos e individuales que ellos aprovecharon hay coraje porque sufrimos la lesi n de dos jugadores de vargas y bogado demasiado premio para cruz azul pero nosotros cometimos errores
587095 por supuesto que la federaci n analice porque cada que nos dirige pasa algo mal tiene algo contra atlas no s qu tiene en contra de nosotros no s qu pensar y tambi n es muy sencillo a lo falso no estoy lamentando la derrota
587096 al perder a itamar batista perdimos la condici n de ataque
587097 a volver a replantear para ganar el pr ximo partido
587098 no se esperaba este resultado adem s de que es un equipo de grupo en comparaci n con el juego ante atlas perdimos desde un principio porque hoy en d a jugar con 10 jugadores es bastante dif cil los equipos son muy buenos f sicamente y nos complica mucho tigres mostr lo que sab amos desde antes que era aprovechar los contraataques en jugadas a reas con blas
587099 ahora no es propicio hablar terminas con la sangre caliente un poco tenemos que descansar un poco y platicar con el entrenador platicar entre nosotros hablar de lo que tenemos que hacer para que el pr ximo partido contra san luis mejoremos porque lo importante ahora es ganar
587100 todos nos hemos planteado hacer un buen partido y es muy dif cil cuando tienes tres goles en contra cuando sali itamar fue m s dif cil porque perdimos al hombre de ataque el bofo se qued muy solo y ellos tienen jugadores con buen toque de pelota se tuvo que cambiar todo despu s de lo que se hab a planteado toda la semana hasta el video de los tigres se sab a como se jugar a pero con el acontecimiento que pas y con dos goles uno encima del otro se tuvo que cambiar toda forma jugar se jug m s por orgullo
587101 se cambia todo porque ten amos un planteamiento con itamar y dem s jugadores sin embargo cuando tienes dos goles en contra y regresas a tratar de recuperar es muy dif cil
587102 ah todos mantienen un orden un equilibrio todos corren aun cuando est s perdiendo son muy profesionales dentro de la cancha por eso son los mejores equipos
587103 muchas veces falta eso en nosotros y eso no puede pasar porque hoy en d a nadie te perdona ni el propio futbol ning n equipo te perdona cuando no se est unido cuando no est n corriendo todos iguales igual cuando tengas un buen equipo en el papel pero si no trasformas eso en la cancha ning n equipo va a ganar
587104 el torneo pasado ganamos los partidos m s dif ciles no soy yo el que tiene decir qui n corre m s cada uno est conciente de lo que hizo y tenemos que mejorar somos profesionales y tenemos que jugar mejor y demostrar el talento en la cancha
587105 todos somos profesionales uno son mas f ciles que los otros no falta coordinaci n pero creo que muchas veces faltan huevos entra la gente a la cancha y asumir el compromiso porque es as y el futbol se juega en todas partes
587106 nosotros estamos coordinados trabajamos toda la semana bien tenemos jugadores importantes jugadores seleccionados todo lo que necesita uno para que dentro de la cancha no se tenga ninguna excusa creo que nos falta a nosotros algo de orgullo y sacar adelante con profesionalismo y con ganas
587107 por suerte el equipo gan y es lo m s importante jugamos ante un gran equipo frente a su gente y hacerle cuatro goles despu s de ir perdiendo es un gran m rito de nosotros
587108 el equipo est muy unido sabemos lo que queremos el partido contra chivas jugamos bien y no merec amos perder y bueno hoy hicimos nuestro juego y nos vamos felices
587109 creo que ellos tuvieron chances claras nosotros tambi n y bueno ellos desaprovecharon y nosotros despu s de ir perdiendo hicimos cuatro goles y eso es importante para el equipo
587110 hay que jugar bien primeramente despu s los goles hay que buscarlos y llegar n solos
587111 fue un partido dif cil creo que nosotros mismos lo regalamos bamos bien y creo que no supimos manejarlo en el segundo tiempo en media cancha perdimos muchos balones y tambi n tuvimos una serie de desatenciones y ellos no las perdonaron
587112 tuve algunas oportunidades en ocasiones entrar n y otras no en lo personal me voy triste en este partido y con ganas de revancha para revertir esta situaci n
587113 hay muchos tipos de presiones lo nico que quiero hacer es las cosas bien en lo personal no me salieron esta noche pero ya saldr n con base en el trabajo
587114 out of many thousands among men one may endeavor for perfection and of those who have attained perfection hardly one knows me in truth while epic hero arjun was in state of vishad yoga mental despair in deep crisis and his ageless friend krishna gave him such knowledge by knowing which there shall nothing further to be known barbara harris whitefied noted that chinese symbol for crisis means opportunity paul twitchell and harold klemp similarly spoken crisis seems to be a ctalyst for spirtual development once have a glimpse of freedon get to liberation now what are the regular experience of crisis which bring us closer this great science of spirtuality bereavement is crisis which takes us into deep concentration and many a times teach us or tell us our latent question childbirth is another portal by which this milestone can be achieved some women get mystic experience of realms physical and emotional torture can give us moment of our exact nature of our seed hoyle said that einstein summed up the whole scientific philosophy in his remarks god may be subtle but hes not malicious
587115 creo que perdemos el partido nosotros porque despu s del 2 1 tuvimos cuatro oportunidades de gol pero no las aprovechamos y vino mi expulsi n y se vino todo en contra en el festejo vamos todos al bander n y se rompe el palo del corner y me amonesta y despu s viene la segunda y ya pas y dej mal parado al equipo y me arrepiento de lo que pas si no por la expulsi n s por los goles que desperdiciamos cuando est bamos 2 1
587116 fueron cosas muy claras que pasaron creo que cometimos errores que no hicimos en el partido pasado y eso nos pes bastante creo que el pr ximo partido tenemos que corregir esto
587117 lo que me gust fue c mo nos paramos al inicio del partido en la cancha con oportunidades de gol y llegando al marco rival eso desde luego lo que m s me gust y lo que no me gust no se lo digo eso lo platico con mis jugadores
587118 as fue salimos con la misma m stica de salir igual en casa que fuera y definitivamente eso dio resultado tengo confianza en los jugadores que tenemos
587119 yo difiero de esa opini n no ten amos un equipo d bil ni mucho menos enfrente muy peligrosos se notaron as sobre todo al principio del partido la expulsi n nos benefici desde luego y pudimos manejarlo mejor
587120 pero por qu no masacrarlo no creo buscamos los goles los tuvimos al final no dejamos de buscarlos primero la base era defenderse bien y atacar mejor
587121 blas siempre la busca y siempre est ah o sea a m no me preocupa de blas que las falle sino que no las falle el d a que no las falle quiere decir que no est ah y el centro delantero que est ah las va a meter
587122 pudo haber fallado el s bado pasado pero la idea es la misma tiene adquirir confianza no importa que falle al menos a m no
587123 en el futbol hay oportunidades y hoy tuve la oportunidad de marcar en dos ocasiones lo que m s me contenta es que ganamos fuera de casa ten amos rato que no gan bamos y nos da esa tranquilidad nos da esa confianza de trabajar
587124 creo que lo importante era trabajar para el partido para nosotros es muy importante porque es rival de grupo y sumamos de a tres que es nuestra meta
587125 son oportunidades ya el partido pasado creo que borr n y cuenta nueva ahora vale que ganamos y el lunes trabajar para el partido contra el atlas y ya a olvidar todo eso
587126 creo que el goleador es as algunas veces se dan oportunidades y algunas veces no y las que tienes hay que aprovecharlas y en esta ocasi n se aprovecharon
587127 yo nunca he estado presionado por ah tenemos que estar tranquilos el delantero tiene que estar tranquilo y yo lo estoy porque estoy teniendo oportunidades es lo bueno por ah me preocupa si no las tengo as que me voy tranquilo por esa parte el equipo est trabajando de buena manera y en lo individual me siento contento creo que los goles le dan confianza a uno
587128 yo creo que ganando nos olvidamos del tema del descenso creo que es importante ganar y m s ante a un rival de grupo nosotros creo que lo que queremos es clasificar a la liguilla y ganando nos olvidamos del tema del descenso
587129 con las circunstancias y nuestros errores se lleg a que perdi ramos un partido m s
587130 es bien complicado hay algunas jugadas que se dejan no s si afortunadamente o desgraciadamente a criterio para algunos rbitros un jal n de playera en un avance importante del rival es tarjeta amarilla para otros no
587131 por ejemplo casi al final andr quiso jugar una pelota r pida lo obstruyen lo hizo con la misma intenci n andr luiz y adolfo contra atlas y hoy si hubo falta y le sacaron tarjeta amarilla y el partido pasado fue un contragolpe y termin con el segundo gol de los rojinegros
587132 es muy complicado porque hay muchas jugadas a criterio al final de cuentas yo creo que el criterio se tiene que unificar en casa en la comisi n de rbitros y a nosotros no nos queda m s que trabajar
587133 cometimos errores muy graves que se platicaron que pod an pasar sab amos c mo ven a a jugar tigres al final de cuentas les dio resultado y nosotros no tuvimos esa reacci n que esper bamos a nadie le gusta la derrota

587141 clearing up the mess left behind is a dirty job but someones got to do it
587142 and that someone should be the person who made the mess in the first place
587143 it is humiliating and no one likes to be embarrassed in public

587157 failure to transition from a marginal player for early adopters to a respected institution integrated into the global financial mainstream
587158 failure to emerge so far is a result of many factors but the root causes were design flaws in the account creation and provisioning logic that led to the unfortunate consequence of vulnerability to criminal abuse criminal abuse of the e gold system in turn led to a self reinforcing negative reputation

587167 im so moved its been a long wait even if we have to wait for hours it is worthwhile
587168 the torch represents peace and harmony the olympic spirit will give us strength to rebuild
587169 theres a lot of glory in having the torch come here this is our way of showing our support
587170 be the biggest loss of my career to right now
587171 it is a different burden for me i can tell you i have two careers most players dont have that experience you play here for the professional league the nba the best league in the world if you win titles in this league that would be wonderful
587172 being in the olympics is a national honor its a dream i have when i am young it is obligation and an expectation that i have from my homeland the whole country is focused on these games in beijing basketball is a big game in china
587173 i would say i am about 60 to 70 percent and that is frustrating i am sure now that i will play in the olympics
587174 but i wont be in my best shape i know that and that is disappointing
587175 this is about different cultures different backgrounds and bringing all people different ways of thinking about things
587176 i cant say that any side is wrong americans say the rockets pay my salary no problem i like the rockets whatever uniform i wear i play 100 percent
587177 for china they have to understand that my loyalty to my country will never change but now i have another group of people in america that i need to take care of these people the chinese fans and american fans are not connected they do not understand how each other think i am the one who is connected i am in the middle that is the important goal of the olympics to bring different people together
587178 obviously a medal is always a dream when youre playing in the olympics
587179 youre standing there and you have a medal it doesnt matter what color you have but to be honest we are not at that level yet especially with the injuries to me and to yi jianlian i am not sure of our fitness we can make some history if we get into the 7th or 6th spot but i think 8th is about where we are
587180 if we win that first game i would quit right away i would say im getting out of here im not playing basketball anymore if we beat usa in game 1 that would be the top i can do no more
587181 i was a very young player and got my first taste of the olympics in 2000 at sydney i played in athens in 2004 and now this is my home country and the highest special honor in 2008 enough i think why would i need to play in london in 2012
587182 my parents do not talk about this but it is a story i have heard from people who are friends of my parents
587183 when my mom lost her chance to play in the olympics instead she had me that year if she had played in the olympics i would probably be two years younger now or maybe not born at all
587184 the first time i really watched the olympics and understood was 1996 in atlanta at that time i was practicing with the shanghai sharks junior team i remember waking up at 3 a m to watch china play argentina on tv we won that game and my parents told me it was a big big event wang zhi zhi played in that game and played well at that time i thought one day i could play in the olympics
587185 when you have the flag in your hand you feel like you have a whole country of people in your grasp and of course you feel the expectation it is the pressure that i have continued to feel every day since i came to the nba and now going back home for the olympics it is such extreme focus
587186 a lot of the people who were living there and all across china were so excited earlier this year about the olympics now 2008 has brought this to us first as the year passes it is difficult to forget we cannot forget we cannot just celebrate games and the olympics when we still have this suffering from the earthquake
587187 in the last several years ive worked with the china youth development foundation
587188 they are focused on building schools for kids in poor areas giving out scholarships last summer we had a successful
587189 at that time besides the money we raised i began thinking that it would be a very good idea to have my own foundation the original plan was to wait until after the olympics to announce it and get it started i would have more time then but the earthquake hit i watched the news i felt so sad i felt helpless in a way and i knew i had to do something right away i can do something to help
587190 there are a lot of different ways to think about things there are republicans and democrats in america there are different parties everywhere many different ideas
587191 but if you are not going then you lost a chance to tell people what you think and we have lost a chance to communicate with you
587192 i think back to when they started the modern olympics in athens in 1896 it was a beautiful idea to put people together again to make friendship and share the honor and share everything
587193 they stopped wars for the olympics they laid down their arms for the games right now war looks like a part of our life in this world but hopefully no wars no bombs no gunshots in those three weeks of the olympics maybe it is a dream it is my wish
587194 orz its sentences like those that that give people the wrong idea download

587197 history is indeed little more than the register of the crimes follies and misfortunes of mankind
587198 there is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide
587199 its amazing i mean our playbook is so thick and tedious and weve thrown a lot at him but hes picked it up
587200 i go through that as much as i can i mean theres so much to it so many adjustments you just have to keep at it
587201 arron sears hes an instinctive guy jeremy zuttah is just like him the learning aspect of the game is not a problem for him
587202 and thats a good thing if youre smart and tough you usually get better and you have a good chance to make it in this business so yeah this kids got a chance to be something
587203 but footballs not forever and this nfl thing is not guaranteed thats why i got the degree and graduated early youve got to be prepared for whatever happens

587236 aj the next time i need my table bussed ill leave you a big tip
587237 youve been sipping on too much of grandpas medicine bottle
587238 losing the starting quarterback another dude you consistently ripped on aint that big of a deal especially with the potential ganz brings to the table
587239 aj hasnt said anything worthly of remarking about so why waste my time
587240 we still have a lot of work to do there are issues that we will have to address we have to move forward to the nsg we are going to keep this momentum up
587241 india is one of the biggest aid donors to afghanistan
587242 from a geopolitical and aid stand the issue for india will be about how to improve security as ties grow closer
587243 i am not expecting any dramatic shift in relations relations are as close as they can be
587244 no as the real killers sivarasan suba and dhanu were already dead
587245 the real reason behind the meeting is still to be revealed by priyanka
587246 the meeting is unique there is no comparison in the world history priyanka and nalini do not know each other prior to the meeting it is unexpected for a daughter of a victim in a gruesome murder to meet an accused who had been sentenced with death penalty later on converted to sentence for life
587247 whatever may me the reason for not coming out with real reason for meeting the courage and the generosity of priyanka should be appreciated the outcome of the meeting in no way helps nalini
587248 the high precision missile can be launched from standard torpedo tubes from a depth of 35 to 40 metres
587249 but extensive new trials conducted in mid july were perfect
587250 first of all it may be recalled that we have condemned this incident in the strongest terms
587251 against this background the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too
587252 there were also bombing incidents in pakistan subsequently but we have not pointed fingers at anyone as we believe in carrying out investigations before laying responsibility
587253 it is important that the blame game is avoided as both countries have an institutionalised counter terrorism mechanism which is working satisfactorily
587254 our attitude towards other non congress and non bjp parties will be determined by their attitude to the bjp or the congress
587255 our aim is to prevent mayawati from going to the bjp camp
587256 we will study the report and make a final suggestion to the state governments for starting the new varsities
587257 we condemn the indefinite curfew and the shoot at sight orders on peaceful protesters in jammu and its outskirts governor nn vohra along with his people is trying to crush the entire movement initiated by the common citizens of jammu against the communal and discriminatory policies of the state government
587258 it is a direct attack on the freedom of press and a human rights violation by the state the national human rights commission nhrc needs to intervene immediately
587259 we immediately demand re allocation of land to the amarnath shrine board and removal of governor vohra
587260 that the queens heart if you choose to leave it there instead of transporting it to a suitable place inside romania will be surrounded by all attributes of attention and respect

587263 lass peggio di una guerra per fortuna marco in salvo ma vorrei tanto essere ancora al campo 4 per dare una mano
587264 gli olandesi dicono che marco cosciente e sta bene racconta manni che siamo riusciti a raggiungere telefonicamente e a campo 4 e passer la notte l per fortuna con lui c un medico che gli ha dato i farmaci contro i congelamenti che tra laltro sembrano meno gravi del previsto lass ci sono anche due sherpa della nostra spedizione che domani aiuteranno marco a scendere
587265 lass peggio di una guerra ripeteva lalpinista davvero da non credere ieri lalpinista serbo precipitato davanti ai miei occhi era su un tratto facile dopo il collo di bottiglia e si ribaltato allindietro improvvisamente io non sono riuscito nemmeno a capire chi era eravamo in 25 a salire stato tremendo

587277 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
587278 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
587279 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
587280 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
587281 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
587282 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
587283 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
587284 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
587285 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
587286 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
587287 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
587288 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
587289 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
587290 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
587291 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
587292 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
587293 you have value on the ground more than you spent
587294 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
587295 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
587296 weve bought the loan at enough of a discount that we can make special arrangements with the borrower
587297 it will equate to a deeper ability to modify mortgages
587298 borrowers are not represented by an attorney or anybody who can advise them about the legal effects of what theyre signing
587299 they may not have disposable income today but theyre going to be the middle class of tomorrow
587300 for entrepreneurs and investors its much safer and it makes much more sense to take a mature and proven model from the u s and copy it in china
587301 tell me one u s internet company that has been successful in china
587302 its much more complicated to run an internet company in china than in the u s
587303 theyre using this environment to win deals that they might not have won last year
587304 theres a notion its a safe haven that markets like new york city are ultimately going to retain their value

587306 growth in the market for new total desalination capacity should increase by approximately 13 percent per year from 2005 to 2015
587307 it takes a lot of pressure to get the pure water to go away from the salt and it takes a lot of energy to pressurize the water
587308 its not a bad analogy because perceptions are not always based on truth in either case
587309 we expect sales outside the united states to remain a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future
587310 significant numbers of people are willing to vote with their feet to try something different whether its retail clinics or medical tourism
587311 thats one of the two big question marks about this and the other is liability
587312 release earnings issue guidance a few weeks later lower earnings a few weeks after that take more write downs raise more capital start it all over again next quarter
587313 right now we believe that we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
587314 what you have here is raising money just to pay off previous equity commitments
587315 potentially limitless dilution of existing shareholders if and when the bank goes to the market for more capital at ever lower prices
587316 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of the most iconic brands of the 20th century
587317 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank
587318 they decided not to pull their product off the shelf
587319 they decided to weather the storm and sell that product thats the worst possible mistake they could have made
587320 the problem is that people buy a fund after the manager has proven that they are a high performer but they sell the first time theres a problem
587321 they wind up chasing performance buying high and selling low instead of sticking with a manager who has proven that they can deliver if you give them enough time
587322 proven that they can dig out of a hole because you have to believe they can create return fast enough to help you catch up from any down period you want them to be able to live up to the expectation you had for the fund when you first bought it which means you have to believe they can get performance back to what you expected over time
587323 when a manager loses conviction in what they are doing thats a problem
587324 go back to why you bought the fund in the first place
587325 and look to see what has changed most managers made their reputation with some periods where they had some trouble unless you are trying to time the market or you see some change in the fund or the hole they have dug for the fund is just too deep you have to give them a chance to rebound or you will never achieve the kind of results that attracted you to the fund in the first place
587326 if it were to include the name of every individual for whom it processed a payment that would be a whole nother story
587327 this has nothing to do with the crisis in housing
587328 the expected revenue does not seem to justify creating this reporting system and i worry if this is the start down a slippery slope in collecting detailed economic data on citizens
587329 we think the premier needs to be honest and open with the people of queensland as to where she is heading with mr reids appointment and with this labor party policy to review shooting galleries in queensland
587330 there is a concern we will have them here and it will slip through under the radar
587331 previously the government has said they wont be having shooting galleries but the party has adopted this policy that is being kept pretty well under wraps and theyve appointed the man who introduced them in new south wales as the head of queensland health
587332 there is a very real concern we will see shooting galleries here in queensland
587333 the scene was overwhelming and i cant explain the stench
587334 every room was filled with animals and they were in the beds and everywhere
587335 i would like a great lake of beer for the king of kings i would like to be watching heavens family drinking it through all eternity

587338 sienna and balthazar were in new york for a few days together and then he told her he was going to la to work and see his kids but the reality is he is desperately trying to get back with his wife
587339 he realises hes made a terrible mistake he is trying to keep sienna at arms length and hasnt told her it is over yet so she is going frantic
587340 she has been calling and texting him constantly and is planning to go to la herself as she believes she can win him back if they have a face to face meeting
587341 shes devastated that he has distanced himself from her both emotionally and geographically
587342 i cant comment when im ready ill issue a statement its because of the children
587343 balthazar and sienna seemed infatuated with each other when they were in new york last week but i heard the reason the whole sienna fling happened was because he fell off the wagon
587344 as soon as balthy arrived back in la on monday he started pleading with his wife to take him back he told me hed gone to their house but she wouldnt let him in he stood outside crying
587345 he came back to a hotel and was on the phone to rosetta on and off for two hours crying and constantly calling and she finally agreed to let him back in the house
587346 in his mind he has definitely dropped sienna but hes in a very confused state at the moment his biggest fear is losing his kids
587347 she is saying the only way she will take him back is if he agrees to addiction and marriage guidance counselling he humiliated her but he is still the father of her four children
587348 sienna has been on the phone to her mother in tears asking her for advice jo knows balthazar as she was with them in italy
587349 jo has been telling sienna to give balthazar space but sienna is worried if she gives him too much space she will lose him she already knows he is drifting away
587350 if she knew he was at the house with his wife she would not like it at all
587351 siennas reputation in hollywood has gone from bad to worse people didnt like it when she was running around with jude law while he was still married but this whole thing with getty is the pits
587352 she is perceived as nothing more than a home wrecker it would be different if her movies did big numbers at the box office but they dont its one thing to misbehave in private but when you cause a huge public scandal and then are photographed half naked with someone elses husband that is something that not only destroys marriages but it can also destroy careers
587353 this band is the first foreign group to perform on this historic ground and we are making history today
587354 this is a significant message from the chinese to say that china is now open to the world
587355 its like when people try to find a way to make the world a better place
587356 cant you go talk to the mayor and have him legalize drugs so we can clean up real crime instead of dealing with stupid drug crimes

587541 unlike christianity which teaches that all the children of adam are sinful for adams sin islam teaches that all humans are innocent by birth and they become sinful only when they consciously commit a sin another important point to bear in mind about the islamic concept of sin is that one mans sin cannot be transferred to another nor can the reward due to a person be transferred either every individual is responsible only for his or her actions for god is never unjust
587542 according to islam the human being is born in a pure state free from sin in a state of fitrah natural instinct and tendency towards truth in complete submission to allah the one and only creator at birth the baby is totally innocent and is not responsible for the sin of his her parents or any of his her ancestors he she starts off with a clean slate and as he she grows up he she uses his her own freedom of choice to do good or evil

587545 i was present in tjilandak in 1964 the first of several visits when the revolution toppled sukarno and brought in not only suharto but also modernist islam and the defeat of javas traditional form of islam so im therefore in a pretty good position to detail pak subuhs change of direction at that point and the beginning of the fog that seemed to descend on subud thereafter until then subud was an esoteric movement clearly following the syncretic sufi path in the javanese style afterwards that all suddenly closed down the explanation for the change of direction was given as political it was too dangerous to pursue the old ideology presumably because it was linked to the communist threat many of the javanese subud members had to go into hiding for their political beliefs and pak subuh hurriedly brought out his bona fide muslim credentials which of course include antagonism to the sufic wisdom and a concentration purely on ritual simple dogma and a personality cult

587551 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better
587552 standing up here on this platform is much different than i imagined

587606 there was this perception that the phoenix market was going to run out of fuel and so you had price spikes and complaints of retailers gouging the public
587607 even during the hurricanes there was never a shortage of that kind of fuel
587608 this year its been all about the crude oil price rise
587609 today you dont have any other technology than this system that can detect impacts or right of way encroachment
587610 fence building is another surprising cause of damage found in the data
587611 but if you look at most new residential developments youll find the facilities are placed on the lot lines and where do you dig a fence post
587612 it allowed us to respond and get into the area while one of the operations was still running and right after one of them had shut down
587613 its an extra level of security that hopefully prevents trouble
587614 you cant make it to the postseason if you dont pitch well
587615 there are actually many positives to being in social groups during the teen years
587616 social groups provide a sense of community and support this is where many people find their life long friends these groups also teach basic social skills such as negotiation compromise teamwork and communication
587617 in social groups members are free to socialize and hang out with others outside the group without worrying about being cast out they may not do everything together and thats ok
587618 theres a fine line between being a helicopter parent who hovers over their child and makes every decision for them and being an involved parent who allows their children to make mistakes and recognize that those are places and opportunities to grow
587619 its not the end of the world if your child is not invited to a sleepover or if somebody says something ugly to your child these are in fact opportunities for your child to grow in character
587620 if the situation crosses over into the realm of harmful behavior your child is being bullied or hazed then as a parent it is your responsibility to get involved
587621 theres almost twice as much turbulence experienced in the winter months than in summer over greenland
587622 the pacific route between australia and the us is another hotspot for turbulence that occurs almost all year round
587623 the us is terrible in the northern summertime because of storms
587624 about a dozen in flight turbulence injuries are reported in australia each year to the atsb and many more go unreported some of these injuries are serious and have resulted in broken bones and head injuries
587625 most commercial aircraft have on board weather radars so they typically avoid the main parts of the thunderstorm however turbulence can occur in regions where the radar is not seeing much but where there is visible cloud
587626 turbulence can also occur in the clear air on the sides and above rising thunderstorms and this seems to be a source of some very severe encounters especially at night when the pilot does not have any visual clues
587627 we had a few drinks paul said that he would like to take me to the beach i knew very well that he meant for sex
587628 cyberbullying is much worse because you cannot see the bully and its a 24 7 thing you cant get away from it
587629 schools are struggling with this issue because youre dealing with a students private space but they know they cant just ignore cyberbullying
587630 we are seeing school systems address this problem in various educational programs and those will continue to grow in number and in content
587631 its just a first date prescribes that you play to win that means that even though a first date isnt a big deal you should still be on your game and try
587632 the first date is either a beginning or ending but what happens next you only know how the date went for you and his impression of the night might be totally different from yours
587633 she got strict instructions she was told to only have a little bit of orange juice and a big coffee in the morning which would make her go to the bathroom
587634 then she was told to keep sucking down coffee all day until at least 3 p m when she could eat lettuce with a tiny bit of tuna with a drop of mayo

587639 the primary years are an academic apprenticeship not only in the basic skills of literacy and numeracy but also bodily skills of application to work and independence in learning its not about turning kids into homework robots but teaching them to apply themselves to their work
587640 there has been inadequate attention given to the ways educational attainment is founded on embodied capacities such as productive stillness and quiet which are crucial to sustained attention and application in intellectual endeavour

587698 its a rather brutal process but it means you can reuse parchment if you are short of it
587699 you take books off shelves you scrub off the text you cut them up and you make a new book
587700 at this point you start thinking striking one palimpsest is gold and striking two is utterly astonishing but then something even more extraordinary happened
587701 even though i couldnt read ancient greek just the fact that i could see the words gave me shivers
587702 the philosophical passage in the archimedes palimpsest is now definitely identified as a relatively early commentary to aristotles categories
587703 it gives us part of a commentary previously supposed lost by the most important of those ancient commentators on aristotle
587704 there is no more important philosopher in the world than aristotle to have early views in the 2nd and 3rd century ad of aristotles categories is just fantastic
587705 we have one book that contains three texts from the ancient world that are absolutely central to our understanding of mathematics politics and now philosophy
587706 i am at a loss for words at what this book has turned out to be to make these discoveries in the 21st century is frankly nutty it is just so exciting

587714 jesus spends the next 28 verses telling them how bad it will be followed with these two verses the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken
587715 the critical thing to understand is that your employees are not doing any of these things to be awkward theyre not doing it because theyre trying to break security theyre simply trying to get their job done the approach has be to not go in there and stop them from doing it go in there and find what constraint have you put in their way thats forcing them to do something that is out of your control and then fix your problem if you gave people the option of using an in house secure controlled environment that meets all of their needs they simply arent going to have the need to go outside if you fail to give them that if you give them restrictions that are unreasonable or stop them doing their job effectively then they will find another way
587716 if rogue users start to see some flexibility on the part of the it department some genuine interest in wanting to provide what they need they may be more open to go to them first and say can you help us provide this as opposed to just going out and doing it they could be part of the solution instead of part of the problem but long term theres this unstoppable force which is demographics new people are coming into the workforce in it and in non it functions and they are becoming more open minded and having more and more of an impact over time its pretty inevitable that the trend is moving toward the more open way of doing things its just a matter of how long it takes and how well it fits into the culture of each organization
587717 fixing mess at hunters view wont be quick easy or cheap
587718 organized by msf here today experts described the scope and impact of the health care worker shortage as well as the critical need to increase government and donor commitment to taking immediate concrete steps to retain and support health care workers now
587719 in thyolo district malawi one nurse keeps 400 patients alive by following up their essential treatment but her basic salary amounts to just 3 a day
587720 it is intolerable to then be told by governments and donor countries that it is unsustainable to raise her wages even though she is responsible for 7 500 worth of drugs a month for her patients those willing to support funding for medicines must find ways to cover recurrent costs like salaries for health workers
587721 it is devastating to stand by and watch people growing sicker and sometimes dying as they wait weeks and even months before being treated simply because there are not enough health care workers
587722 overworked underpaid and undervalued health care workers in southern africa are increasingly scarce just as the number of hiv patients is rising antiretrovirals may be present on more hospital and clinic shelves but without the health staff to administer them a deadly gap will only grow wider

587734 also regrettable but i dont think china is regressing the way that russia is we have a greater opportunity to work in a cooperative way with china
587735 we understand as the dalai lama does that tibet is part of china but we hope tibetans are not repressed or oppressed
587736 you dont want to go over there and insult the chinese
587737 it would not be good for our relations i certainly dont think the president would or should go over there and be confrontational at the same time i think the president can in a very diplomatic style make it clear what we stand for and believe in
587738 i see a steady progression in russia of more and more repression of rights and the disappearance of semblances of democracy
587739 we have to deal with them negotiate with them especially in light of their hoard of petrodollars but we cant sit by and watch a country murder people in england
587740 given the impact that this order will have on americas intelligence community and this committees responsibility to oversee intelligence activities this cannot be seen as anything other than an attempt to undercut congressional oversight
587741 we were only shown the document after it was complete and on its way to the president for his signature
587742 weve been in a conversation with congress and the american people about the structure of the intelligence community since the fall of 2004
587743 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
587744 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
587745 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
587746 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
587747 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
587748 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
587749 today is the 2008 version of the boston tea party
587750 many concerns that the intelligence community voiced that made it difficult to prosecute leaks
587751 the showing that the danger exceeds the value of disclosure is a complete imponderable
587752 that would require the government to come in and basically make a bad problem worse by articulating precisely how threatened disclosure could cause yet more harm
587753 what im not willing to do is to take steps that will essentially do more to protect leakers than it does to protect journalists
587754 but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
587755 things look so much better than a few weeks ago that i think we are near to reaching agreement
587756 i dont think it will take months were looking at more like days or weeks
587757 instead of keeping their promise to drain the swamp of corruption in washington house democrats are sinking in it
587758 i wanted to make certain that if i did something wrong let other members know what line there is to cross
587759 and in the other area i needed them to help me to remove any question of gifts where no gifts exist
587760 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
587761 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
587762 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
587763 theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and theyre going to send out nasty e mails
587764 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
587765 what were seeing out of the mccain campaign the republican party and some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges
587766 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
587767 from obamas repeated suggestion that hes running a racist campaign
587768 when he did it the first time yesterday we let it pass when he did it again later specifically linking us to it we decided to respond
587769 it is im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and we dont theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
587770 what we are talking about here is substance and not style
587771 campaigns are tough but i am proud of the campaign we have run im proud of the issues we have raised
587772 all theyre doing is churning out the same stuff they do every four years all you have to do is change the name
587773 so when you hear my opponent say hes too risky what theyre really saying is we know we dont have any good ideas but you should be worried about him
587774 it seems to me at this point it would be naive of the obama campaign not to anticipate efforts to tear at obamas character the way bush tore away at john kerrys character four years ago so if a fellow can rationally expect a swift boat full of funny racial angles racing at him he would only be sane to try to deflect that
587775 this is not a complex case and it should move quickly
587776 they have had a lot of time during the grand jury investigation to be preparing
587777 the great fear is that if a big established chemical like this can be driven from the market whats next
587778 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why
587779 its his voice but im going inside his head to speak some psychological truth about him
587780 no one is closer to mccain than salter who has been with him since 1989
587781 things go on inside mccains head that rarely or never come out
587782 to prove to myself that i was the man i had always wanted to be
587783 our nation has a unique place in the world we are the greatest force for good on earth we chart historys course yes we must be involved in the destiny of other nations
587784 history of the decline and fall of the roman empire
587785 enter public life determined to tell the truth to put problem solving ahead of partisanship to defend the public interest against the special interests to risk your personal ambitions for the sake of the country and the ideals that make her great keep your promise to america and you will keep your honor you will know a happiness far more sublime than pleasure
587786 when they need congressional assistance they use the pac to build relationships to work towards achieving a legislative goal other times when they have involuntarily become the object of congressional interest they use the pac to build relationships in an effort to avoid negative legislation
587787 he was a very early supporter of senator obama and began that support long before the senate investigation into tax havens
587788 hes very interested in politics and he gives to both sides
587789 peter lowy never took any action to hide his ownership in anything
587790 peter lowy did not do anything improper or illegal or unethical
587791 the iron ring of secrecy around tax haven banks and their deceptive banking practices enable and encourage tax cheats to hide assets from the united states
587792 weve had four more years of bad economic policies that have run the economy into a very bad place
587793 he made me feel better that theres the possibility that business as usual will stop
587794 the way you win florida is you do what hes doing
587795 this is not a complex case and it should move quickly
587796 this is the first time in my life i have asked for a speedy trial
587797 this is my life now and i was eager to get back to it and i couldnt be happier
587798 next year you and i and everybody else will be freer and have more space to say what we believe to be the truth
587799 the lesson here is that this is what foreign policy ought to be about
587800 this legislation will create a higher education system that is more affordable fairer and easier to navigate for students and families
587801 the greatest threat to higher education isnt underfunding its over regulation
587802 it needs to be done before the kids go back to school this fall
587803 i talk to senator kennedy once a week to give him a report on whos been naughty and whos been nice
587804 the order was simply out of date and it needed to be updated to conform with the new intelligence structure
587805 we were only shown the document after it was complete and on its way to the president for his signature
587806 after seven years of a go it alone presidency perhaps i should expect nothing more from this white house but this order will be binding on future administrations as well
587807 given the impact that this order will have on americas intelligence community and this committees responsibility to oversee intelligence activities this cannot be seen as anything other than an attempt to undercut congressional oversight
587808 la d claration minist rielle est r dig e et transmise au cabinet avec laccord de tous ses membres
587809 this is a little like saudi arabia announcing its going to conserve oil
587810 because we are such a water rich part of the globe weve never had to conserve water the fact were doing it now not only shows its important to us but a signal to the rest of the world it has to start doing the right thing
587811 we still have to fight a multi front war to bring the great lakes back from a tipping point
587812 my intention is to move this and move this fast
587813 its not the container size its the commodity were worried about it
587814 theres an opportunity for commercialization if you start shipping water out of the basin in bottles the dam has broken and everybody will be after our water
587815 you cannot negotiate with coburn its just something that you learn over the years is a waste of time
587816 if we pass a new program we either ought to get rid of the old program or we ought to make it to where it blends with this other one so its effective
587817 almost everything that theyve offered has a duplicate program out there that theyre not either eliminating or changing
587818 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
587819 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
587820 it was a victory for all who believe in checks and balances it certainly strengthens our hand
587821 the process of negotiation and accommodation that most often leads to resolution of disputes between the political branches
587822 is a tribute to what we can achieve in foreign policy when the cause is right and all parties work together in goodwill
587823 intended to keep more deserving american families in their homes
587824 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
587825 senator mccain has always said that withdrawal has to be based on conditions on the ground and the judgment of military commanders
587826 theres not as much disagreement there as i think people may perceive
587827 the resources they consider necessary to carry out their mission
587828 no amount of additional u s forces can affect the outcome
587829 john mccains essential focus has been on the tactical issue of sending more troops
587830 hes made his entire approach to foreign policy rest on that support of bushs decision to send more troops in
587831 senator obama doesnt understand he doesnt understand whats at stake here
587832 he chose to take the political path that would have helped him get the nomination of his party
587833 if we place 30 000 more troops in there then we would see an improvement in the security situation and a reduction in the violence
587834 i think it is indisputable that weve seen violence reduced
587835 and thats a credit to our brave men and women in uniform
587836 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
587837 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with i think its happening but its a process and it fights the normal physics of national politics
587838 specifically sought out people who are going to play by those rules
587839 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
587840 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
587841 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and off shore drilling
587842 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional off shore drilling is wrong
587843 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
587844 for those of us whove been involved with politics in alaska one of the paradigms that we counted on in terms of funding public policy was the capability of ted stevens
587845 its not as though we dont have the capability to take care of ourselves
587846 if he leaves the appropriations committee how long do they leave the stryker brigade here
587847 there are a lot of things that are attributable to him that are likely to dry up
587848 the failure of senator obama to understand the need to increase domestic production is just stunning and thats going to be a real hurdle for him to overcome because everybody gets it
587849 apparently hundreds of thousands of gallons of spilled oil dead fish and oil covered birds arent ideal conditions for peddling a misguided plan for more offshore drilling
587850 unfortunately the risk for such spills and far worse would only increase if john mccain and george bush get their way and allow big oil to begin the exploitation of our coasts
587851 im sorry we were unable to go to an offshore oil rig because i think that drilling offshore is a vital step in addressing the price of oil and americas energy needs
587852 i would think its several million already and millions to go
587853 i dont think its negative i think were drawing differences between us
587854 i responded to it because im disappointed and i dont want that issue to be part of this campaign
587855 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative community and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
587856 i think that what people are really concerned about what theyre looking for is fundamental change on the economy things that are going to help their families live out the american dream there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phony allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
587857 iraq and our strategic position in the middle east in ruins risking a wider war in the near future
587858 amounted to a real time test for a future commander in chief
587859 america passed that test i believe my judgment passed that test and i believe senator obamas failed
587860 a pretty good timetable as we should have horizons for withdrawal but they have to be based on conditions on the ground
587861 the american people are looking for a serious debate about the way forward in iraq and afghanistan and angry false accusations will do nothing to accomplish that goal
587862 to be unusual and provocative and i do have questions about whether they meet the requirements of due process that is guaranteed in our constitution
587863 while the scope of the case presented unusual challenges defendants constitutional rights were carefully protected and exercised
587864 if our honorable judges had known how this dubious experiment would have turned out they never would have allowed it
587865 hes in a position to make the decision on short notice if he wanted to
587866 i have not i can only be interested if john is
587867 housing prices have already fallen 15 percent and they need to fall 10 percent more this bill isnt going to change that equation
587868 this legislation will not perform miracles i want the american people to have realistic expectations about what were about to do
587869 but as others have said it is a step and an important step towards putting our nation on the road to economic recovery
587870 this is not the bill he would have drafted on his own but its time for action
587871 who have been caught between rising mortgage payments and falling home values and are in danger of losing their homes
587872 everything is so unstable and people are so panicky that i see a lot of this as an effort to calm people down
587873 the whole bill is an attempt to change the equilibrium
587874 clearly in areas where home prices have dropped its going to be utilized more
587875 it also depends on the borrowers unique financial circumstances why are they struggling did they lose their job if its a temporary hardship then youre not going to use this program at all if its something of greater significance then this may be the best option
587876 how effective can the fha refinancing program be in light of how slow and ineffective mortgage servicers have been so far
587877 we always maintain that no u s government foreign service person overseas should be seen to be advocating one side or the other
587878 when a german sees you there theyre not going to think oh he or she is on their off time its oh they are a democrat a republican an independent god knows what
587879 the fact that you are working for the u s government overseas should not preclude political activity that you could engage in in the united states
587880 a u s citizen employee spouse or family member shall not engage in partisan political activities abroad
587881 i dont believe weve ever had to interpret this before none of us thinking about this could come up with a precedent
587882 its an insult to americas workers for the department of labor to be spending its time in the last year of this administration allegedly fine tuning the details of how to do these regulations when other than the one ordered by a court they have issued no major worker health regulations
587883 the reality is theres a great need to light a fire under this moribund agency to do something anything to protect workers
587884 the fact that the department of labor seems to be engaged in secret rulemaking makes me highly suspicious that some high level political appointees are up to no good this congress will not stand for the gutting of health and safety protections as the bush administration heads out the door
587885 people appear to be making assumptions about whats in the draft
587886 this is going to let me go back to school get my masters degree
587887 i can definitely save some money it opens up a lot for me
587888 it means a lot it means that prayers are being answered

587891 he would lean up against the easel steadying his hand that way and he painted it was not easy
587892 he just had a sensitivity to his drawing he would use a white highlight instead of the dark line and shadow
587893 the lines just flowed they were just pleasing to look at there was a lot of feeling to the faces
587894 give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
587895 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
587896 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
587897 i can walk with my head held high because im clean i did not voluntarily take any drug
587898 the fact that this news comes out today 24 hours before my departure for the games makes me think
587899 oh my god lets get you home so i can check your bp

587929 in conjunction with its partner in the project international finance corporation rio tinto is currently studying the issues raised in the correspondence
587930 rio tinto remains confident that its arrangements are in all respects in conformity with guinean laws and that it has complied with its obligations
587931 rio tinto negotiated and executed the simandou mining concession in full transparency with the guinean government and is currently in discussion with relevant ministers with a view to resolving any issues
587932 indicated that he had a weapon and left with an undisclosed amount of money
587933 this is a top forum for hearing important new scientific research and for productive structured dialogue on the major challenges facing the global response to aids
587934 however as is often the case with global conferences like this one the needs of children are too low on the agenda
587935 almost 1 200 children a day under the age of 15 are newly infected with hiv around 90 percent of those from mother to child transmission which is preventable
587936 as a global community we should be ashamed that 9 out of every 10 hiv positive children get the virus from their mothers during pregnancy childbirth or breastfeeding a particular tragedy because mother child transmission can be safely stopped prevention services can reduce transmission risk to less than 2 but only about 1 in 10 hiv positive pregnant women who need arvs get them theres no acceptable reason to not put an end to mother to child transmission
587937 without addressing the needs of children impacted by hiv and aids and of those infected by mother child transmission specifically the iac will sadly prove to be just another expensive talking shop to the millions who need action now
587938 whoa i didnt see you where did you come from
587939 but these impulses may be from below not from above
587940 they do not seem to me to be such but if i am the devils child i will live then from the devil
587941 hey the next time you guys go out and do something i would like to come along
587942 what you cant establish with wit you can always further with a little volume
587943 i know youre always there to my every prayer inside im clinging to the promise of a lifetime i hear the words you say to never walk away from me and leave behind the promise of a lifetime
587944 my opinion is that the technology exists and we should probably use it
587945 if it makes the road safer then you should do it
587946 i see people slowed down rather than speeding up as they approach camera enforced intersections
587947 but what i will say is that what i see on these videos can scare me
587948 but these impulses may be from below not from above
587949 they do not seem to me to be such but if i am the devils child i will live then from the devil

587961 the impact of oil prices on local economies is extremely big
587962 this is the subject the entire government should handle with all its might
587963 i will firmly take emergency measures for people who are seriously affected by abnormal oil prices
587964 before and immediately after august 8 we will not see persistent heavy rainfall
587965 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
587966 it is impossible to tell at what time the rain will fall on august 8 but we cannot exclude that there will be periodic rain then
587967 normally a typhoon can affect an area for one or two days
587968 it would not have a long term effect but would only have an effect for a limited period
587969 hrc is proud to throw our full support behind senator obamas presidential campaign
587970 senator obama has consistently shown that he understands as we do that glbt rights are civil rights and human rights senator obama has said that embracing our gay brothers and sisters is true to martin luther kings vision i know that senator obamas vision is one of equality fairness and justice for all of us

587977 the city of detroit is desperately trying to attract grocery stores
587978 but for whatever reason chains cannot be convinced to do business here
587979 in most cases these are stores indigenous to the area and have been handed down from generation to generation
587980 by the time i was born in 1968 i know they had expanded into mainly selling meat
587981 we see ourselves as a gourmet store with an emphasis on latin food
587982 and we listen to what our customers want when people started asking about organic foods we gave it a try and its doing well for us
587983 the fact that we have all these stores so close together offering high quality products has greatly impacted the quality of life for everyone in the area
587984 not just the ethnic population but the seniors and low income population as well who might have trouble driving to get groceries
587985 my wife for example is a vegetarian who grew up in san francisco
587986 when she moved here in 2001 she couldnt find any of the food items she was accustomed to now honey bee offers organic milk and other hormone free products
587987 detroit in general has really dismal offerings in terms of recent national food trends where people are turning toward stores like whole foods and trader joes were one of the few communities where you can find three different stores offering these high quality products in one area
587988 when you think of martin luther king jr blvd in any given city you tend to get the image of blight and lack of retail
587989 but when you think of a cesar chavez blvd you think of a really vibrant bustling retail area
587990 they tend to focus a lot of activities around meals
587991 and they generally buy more food per capita especially fresh food
587992 over there we sell prairie farms milk for 3 89 a gallon next to that we have lala milk for 4 69 they always buy lala even though the only thing special about it is the label
587993 we are building a sophisticated facility with new technology and we want well educated people who will work with us and want to live in kalamazoo
587994 some of the other sites gave a lot of talk about future education plans but in the case of kalamazoo they already had a commitment to developing a well educated community
587995 what we had here was a traditional inner city that was dying
587996 we had the traditional institutions like hospitals schools and museums but the population was leaving and those that remained were paying more taxes
587997 we are experiencing job growth and families are moving back and stabilizing the area
587998 the promise has just given us this renewed sense of optimism
587999 when i went to college i had to work a full time job and go to school
588000 i want my kids to focus on their education so they can do a whole lot better than i did
588001 i wish i could say the economy is turned around but i cant say that yet
588002 i get about 40 to 50 calls a month asking about the promise
588003 right now there are about 24 different communities that have similar programs
588004 we may have not talked about the promise to get the bond passed but it was the elephant in the room
588005 the promise is generous in that it pays for tuition but some families need help to buy college materials such as textbooks
588006 there is also no new money to deal with the increase in school enrollment and volunteers also have been needed to run meetings that teach students how to prepare for college
588007 we have 40 000 college students right now if we can keep them here companies and entrepreneurs will build around them and then we can become a community of promise
588008 she was so much about being one with the world and mother nature and there was a certain amount of understanding in her that you could see behind her eyes
588009 i dont plan to go out and do action or not do action

588011 when youre a teenager you could do a lot more crazy things and your body recovers faster
588012 but the sense of endurance and protecting your body is not there so you just learn to deal with it
588013 glad sidney crosby isnt on their team as the talented but inferior mike richards is a much better player

588015 look at us we can use speakers to make your ear drums break and your chest and head pound but we cant really sing
588016 why are there so many programming languages why dont you just all use one
588017 i think its come to the point where there needs to be some decisions made on the behalf of the packers on behalf of brett and on behalf of all the fans
588018 this is a special version with no junk stuffs installed
588019 trickle down hell yeah that sounds great id like a trickle from your fountain of wealth just as long as i can keep my guns and that lady over there cant get an abortion its a deal
588020 another reason people vote republican is because they just arent as stupid as you liberals think they are
588021 not one thing yip says in his rant is true
588022 class talks about the kkk but yet there is an active kkk member in the us senate and hes a liberal democrat robert byrd
588023 sorry your democrat scare tactics dont work anymore people have gotten smarter
588024 they see how the dems in congress dont give a damn about people all they want to do is line their own pockets like democrat sen dianne feinstein
588025 and algore getting rich off the global warming scandal while he uses enough electricity to power hundreds of homes
588026 meanwhile the democrat lead congress approval rating is the lowest in american history single digits 9
588027 you guys may be like minded but there are far more people out there who think like i do and agree with me than whack job libs like you jeeniuses
588028 this month voters trust democrats more than republicans on seven out of ten electoral issues tracked rasmussen reports the republicans have managed to gain back some lost ground on national security and the war in iraq last month the democrats had the advantage on all ten key issues

588053 and this is what makes the release such an exciting event for our community new ideas means new developments and success for our area
588054 because it allows the entire general public to learn about things they never before furthermore it may even convince them to go out and buy the professors book

588125 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

588138 we have a proud history in racing with 54 continuous years of nascar involvement and have enjoyed worldwide success in all forms of racing
588139 but all should be assured that no one was more disappointed than we were with the events in indianapolis
588140 we are the first to admit that we missed the mark with the combination for this race there are many reasons but they are only important today from the perspective that we learn from those issues and move forward successfully
588141 the knowledgeable people in our business understand the solution to this issue involves all elements of the equation
588142 we are committed to working to bring those elements together in a manner that will produce consistent great racing
588143 our responsibility is to provide a tire that works with all of the variables and we take that responsibility very seriously
588144 we have been performance partners with nascar for more than 50 years and we are absolutely committed to remain in that role for another 50 years

588157 let me rephrase rafa wins cinci title loses first round of the olympics roger wins gold
588158 if it makes you feel better and perhaps in my attempt to regain any respect i may have lost i will list other bands i like later when play is done
588159 why should players with big serves be penalized they have worked on their serves just as hard as other players worked on their ground strokes why should they be penalized for something they have but others dont again id really appreciate a thoughtful answer to this question
588160 hey just for kicks lets change things up and slow our courts down
588161 ms blackwell retired from her match yesterday because of a sore shoulder yet she is playing doubles today hummmmmmmm
588162 sorry to disappoint you but that is not unusual at all players often have injuries that prevent their playing singles but allow them to play doubles
588163 you still have to serve in doubles dont you if your shoulder hurts that bad why risk injuring it more in a doubles match not at a grand slam yes ms blackwell is her name
588164 on 18th august even if rafa loses tonight he will have 6175 points to rogers 5830
588165 and sherlock thats actually not the only reason why the all england club adopted the current slower grass courts take a look at this article which explains how the clay court specialists also had a hand in that
588166 just so you know this is a clearly biased article
588167 it still amazes me how far safina has come in the last couple of months she won berlin made it to the rg finals and just won la last year she lost to henin 6 0 6 2 at the us open this year she has a good shot to win montreal and go deep at the open but her run must end if when she plays venus or serena
588168 you think karlovic serves big then why am i winning more return points
588169 next oh no dr ivo no no no we dont need every game tbs when feds game is so fragile
588170 but then we come back to my question why should he be penalized for his serve just because we find stepaneks sv more appealing again thats a pure preference so i dont think its a very good reason for penalizing big servers
588171 and that first point in the tiebreak is why nadal deserves to be no 1
588172 one more match and jankovic is 1 she must beat cibulkova on a roll i hope she gets a good nights sleep
588173 well if nothing else roger will have a lot of new points to be gained next year and rafa will have a whole lot to defend
588174 i have to point out feds been no 1 for 4 5 years but hes only dominated for two of those years so theres a big difference between the two
588175 i think the pressure finally got to rafa tonight knowing roger went out early increasing his changes of getting to 1 that much sooner but the tough match against haas good show tommy was just what he needed to bring him back to his senses and i dont think hell make the same mistakes or be as nervious tomorrow against lapentti
588176 plus he must defends his points barring any resurgence of nalbandian so he just sould stick to the plan and stop playing with this pressure of being n 1
588177 i was tense during robby fed no doubt but for whatever reason i find that watching tennis live is less stressful than watching it on tv atp feed whatever maybe because i didnt have commentators in my ear or maybe i was just so appreciative of the experience that i didnt much care about the end result
588178 eddy youre like batman lol you just appear outta nowhere yeah he could try it out in practice im sure wilson would whip him up something good
588179 he only lost two points on the last set thats terrible for the tennis
588180 i bet dr ivo cant sleep knowing that he cannot do anything on a tennis court except serve 2 forehand winners in 3 sets just pathetic my heart still belongs to the guy who faces that and still manages to play something of a beautiful game todays loss is a loss not for roger federer but for tennis in general
588181 i think it will be interesint to see what happens to federer once rafa becomes number 1 will he slide off and become a solid top 10 performer like say james blake or will he make deep runs in slams and stay at number 2
588182 my only goal is continuing playing like what i did in the last four five months if i continue like this i going to have a lot of chances for be no 1 if not i dont want to be no 1 because my opponents are very good
588183 afraid why he even looked genuinely surprised no there is no reason to be afraid if djokovic becomes no 2 it is because he plays better i just have to try my best and improve
588184 i am conscious this guy djokovic is going to be no 1 at least no 2 latest wimbledon not just because of the not so many points he has to defend but because of the way he plays
588185 and it helps explaiin sic why this rivalry may be the one that ultimately helps many many otherwise indifferent or even critical sports fans come to love tennis not just one or the other player which boils down to a simple matter of personal taste or the intensity of the rivalry we already had that in mcenroe lendl not just a colorful attention getting personality jimmy connors anyone or the symbolism embodied by the contrasting styles and personalities of the two titans but the game and lets face it the one thing that endures and lifts countless spirits over years and decades and eras and even centuries is the game
588186 fix it and get it right for the long haul
588187 i often notice this line of thinking on the part of purists not just in tennis but also in other sports the arts or in fact anything that involves human creativity
588188 the guy is not too thin look at the recent shirtless pics from cincy
588189 once in the early 90s sampras was at dinner with commentator mary carillo when the subject of gonzalez came up
588190 and can both kohlshcreiber and soderling lose come on tennis gods do us a favor and smite those two sour pickles
588191 controlled by agents pr reps isnt necessarily a bad thing but i see that ive already dealt with this in my very first post earlier
588192 pancho actually beat laver more than twice yes in his forties not bad indeed iirc bud collins still says that pancho had the best serve ever
588193 according to espn baggys wrist is still out of wack
588194 his refusal to try anything new at rg this year resulting in
588195 moya has to play again its a shame the way we treat our senior citizens
588196 hhhmmmm i see faderer is still struggling i know karlovic can serve like a machine but last year he was a snack cake for roger
588197 though i must confess i have an irrational searing dislike for blake
588198 so what does this mean does rafa still have to win cincy to be 1 or is qfs enough
588199 ohh look at all those points to scoop up next year
588200 this just isnt the way nadal is supposed to get to 1 bleh
588201 mr rick in all sincerity i would rather have rafa as 1 then watch that ugly nothing game of dr evil be rewarded any further
588202 in queens i was feeling so tense in that third set tiebreak its just a crapshoot so try not to feel too unhappy
588203 harini you and me both i was so hoping for a resurgent roger against nadal in the final those matches are just magic this just isnt the way nadal is supposed to get to 1 bleh
588204 its all about the excuses for some fans shame some fans dont have an ounce of the class fed himself has focus on your guy dont diminish someone elses accomplishments as a way to mitigate your own disappointment
588205 some days you win some days you lose some days it rains
588206 dont agree naughty i have more respect for ivos game than just his serve he has a great volley and good groundies
588207 i think its time for a change in the headcase all stars gasquet deserves to be promoted to co captain
588208 i think roger losing like this regardless of the reasons actually takes a little bit away from what nadal has done this year after all this isnt the in form federer of 2003 2007 fed losing to the likes of ivo and all these second and third class players and virtually giving up the number one ranking makes nadal beating him much less impressive
588209 i think it will be interesint to see what happens to federer once rafa becomes number 1 will he slide off and become a solid top 10 performer like say james blake
588210 its perfectly acceptable to express your preferences but you should understand that theyre only that preferences
588211 yes its true no matter how nadal reaches the 1 it has been well and spectacularily earned on the courts of europe and england and even now on the hardcourts nothing can take that away from him
588212 you may think todays tennis is better off with the slower courts and balls but ive seen many others who say theyre actually ruining todays tennis by not allowing serve and volley
588213 but you also need to understand that your preferences are no more valid than those of others with differing views
588214 now the old king is dead long live the king
588215 nadal will become the new no 1 if he wins cincinnati
588216 after all the complex calculations coming into this week its very simple now if nadal wins the cincinnati title he will be no 1 next monday if nadal reaches the cincinnati final it looks like he will become no 1 the following week anyway thats when federer loses his points from the montreal final last year
588217 the serve is no less of a shot than the regular groundies
588218 t he all england club should return to its previous fast grass surface because the grand slam tournaments today have become too alike this is why i also say the aussies should do the same with rebound ace because by most accounts plexicushion is too similar to decoturf once theres a variety of surfaces a variety of playing styles will likely follow in fact if the last federer sampras exhibition showed anything its that serve and volleying can still be a threat to todays baseline game im not counting their first three exhibitions cause the courts used for those tussles were reportedly way too fast for regular professional use let the tourney directors do their job and let the players do their job i think thats a better way to spend our time and attention than bemoaning the current state of affairs in tennis which whatever its faults is in a great shape
588219 i have never seen roger live my one chance at seeing him live he loses to divo of all people
588220 if rafa wins 2008 cincy he gets 500 added to his ranking points while if roger loses before the semifinals the most he can gain is 125 if he reaches qf so rafa will surpass federers ranking by gaining more than 300 points on federer from 2008 cincy
588221 sophia the number one and number two rankings are more than just symbolic they define tournament seedings in general the higher your ranking the more advantageous your draw

588257 we are not effectively reaching men who have sex with men and african americans to lower their risk
588258 c d c s new incidence estimates reveal that the h i v epidemic is and has been worse than previously known
588259 therefore there are roughly 225 000 more people living with h i v in the u s than previously suspected
588260 the previous estimate was 1 million to 1 1 million
588261 u s efforts to prevent h i v have failed dismally
588262 this paper has been scrutinized by some of the best statisticians in the country and is much better now than when we started this process it was so complicated that even i who has some expertise in this area could not stand by it without making sure we had gone through the review process
588263 this is one of those examples where getting the external review process to really scrutinize the paper pick it apart build it back up has in my opinion fundamentally improved it
588264 h i v prevention has been underfunded and too often hindered by politics and ideology
588265 since fiscal year 2002 when adjusted for inflation c d c s prevention budget has actually shrunk by 19 percent the president has recently requested decreases in funding for h i v prevention at c d c
588266 less and less money to actually get these programs to the communities that need them
588267 it looks like prevention campaigns make even less difference than anyone thought
588268 h i v incidence did not decline as much from the 1980s to the 1990s as we believed
588269 despite the dramatic increase in condom promotion and so called prevention education
588270 if there is any good news here it is hard to report it but there is a little bit in the sense that while incidence rates are certainly too high they are stable that is important because a stable number of new infections in a world that has got more and more people with h i v and people with aids living in it suggests that we are keeping up with that pressure for transmission
588271 well if i wasnt convinced that i was the most cursed person on the planet i am now

588308 answering a question about his approach to combatting crime john mccain suggested that military strategies currently employed by us troops in iraq could be applied to high crime neighborhoods here in the us mccain called them tactics somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement the way he described it his approach sounded an awful lot like the surge as part of his argument mccain praised the crime fighting efforts of former new york mayor rudolph giuliani urban league president marc morial countered that while new york did experience a drop in crime under giuliani there were several major instances of police misconduct to which mccain promised aggressive prosecution of civil rights violations and a justice department free from political cronyism
588309 its good for malaysia where track cycling is concerned my personal goal is for the team to finish in the top eight of the team sprint and hopefully we will clock a new personal best
588310 a top eight finish in the 200m sprint will be great for the keirin if we can get both riders in the final top six we have a good chance to get into the medal round

588312 hai pembesar pembesar siapakah diantar kamu sekelian sanggup membawa singgahsananya kepada ku sebelum mereka datang kepada ku sebagai orang orang yang berserah diri
588313 berkata ifrit yang cerdik itu dari golongan jin aku akan datang kepada ku dengan membawa singgahsana itu kepada mu sebelum kamu berdiri dari tempat dudukmu sesungguhnya aku benar benar kuat untuk membawanya lagi dapat dipercayai
588314 aku akan membawa singgahsana itu kepada mu sebelum matamu berkedip
588315 maka tatkala sulaiman melihat singgahsana itu terletak di hadapannya ia pun berkata
588316 as modern warfare becomes more technologically sophisticated and targeting more precise it is essential not to succumb to the idea that the damage on the ground is also precise and limited it may be in some cases but precise bombing does not always yield precise or limited damage as this study indicates the health and environmental consequences of precision bombing can affect unborn generations far into the future even when the bombs are entirely successfully in finding their targets

588369 to say that it is ending is not to suggest that it was misguided or illegitimate it is merely to acknowledge that these eras tend to last a generation but no longer
588370 lets be clear it is not the protectionists of the afl cio or cnn who are primarily to blame for the erosion of public support for trade in the united states as bone headed as they may be the blame lies squarely with a business community that continues to support republican politicians who refuse to raise the taxes and spend the money necessary to provide the economic safety net for american workers that a free market economy has not and will not provide
588371 for the past 25 years the united states has put its faith in open unregulated and lightly taxed markets and theres little doubt that over time that model has expanded economic output and improved economic efficiency but what americans have also come to realize is that the same model is less adept at providing other things that we value highly things like safety fairness economic security and environmental sustainability its too early to say what the new model will be or what the new era will be called

588385 the president of the carroll county chapter of maryland municipal league is asking each county municipality to pay 375 to cover the cost of scholarships the league awarded
588386 after a two year hiatus the carroll chapter decided to give three 1 000 scholarships to students pursuing municipal careers but the chapter was surprised to learn it would have no monetary help from the state association said chapter president frank johnson the scholarships were awarded in june the same time the chapter found out theyd have to foot the bill entirely the checks have recently been sent to students johnson said
588387 re directed funds that had helped to support the chapter scholarship program in order to support a new academic fellowship intern scholarship program initiative which will create a partnership with the university of maryland school of public affairs and the mml
588388 to increase public awareness of municipal government in carroll county and to foster interest and research in municipal government to recognize students who have demonstrated a commitment to public service and to provide needed financial support for students pursuing studies leading to a career in government or public service
588389 after a two year hiatus the carroll chapter decided to give three 1 000 scholarships to students pursuing municipal careers
588390 our assumption was that nothing had changed from a few years ago
588391 no one was aware that there had been a change
588392 agreed to continue our own self funded scholarship program within the carroll county chapter
588393 carroll county chapter of the maryland municipal league articles of organization
588394 juggling the intricacies of a municipal government can be challenging for anyone and there are sure to be missteps along the way
588395 no one was aware that there had been a change
588396 frank johnson has been wearing a lot of different hats lately but the time has come for him to step back and make some realistic decisions about where he believes he can do the most good
588397 johnson also took a job as assistant to county commissioner julia walsh gouge and while he and others have said there is nothing legally wrong with collecting paychecks from both the town of mount airy and the county there likely is an ethical issue involved
588398 at the very least johnson has spread himself too thin to be entirely effective in any one of the positions and because his many positions span from mount airy to carrolls municipalities to county government that means the impact is being felt everywhere in the county
588399 johnson owes it to the people of mount airy owes it to the towns cities and organizations that make up the council of governments and owes it to taxpayers who pay his salary as gouges assistant to step back from some of these responsibilities
588400 he must assess where he believes he can be most effective and then concentrate on those areas
588401 wanting to help out in as many different ways as possible is an admirable trait but it does no good if the person is running in so many different directions that it takes away from all of his various jobs and duties
588402 375 is a fairly small price to pay for such an important program
588403 you dont go out and spend money before making the budget he said
588404 the funds were unfairly split they should have been divided per capita not by town he said
588405 375 is not going to break us but we have to do it differently next year grossnickle said
588406 what happens in one part of this county does have an effect on other parts there is much more of a connection and a need for ongoing communication a problem solving approach that brings everybody to the table
588407 ongoing communication a problem solving approach that brings everybody to the table
588408 before accepting the position johnson received approval from both the county ethics administrator and the mount airy ethics commission

588433 my parents were the best and i thank the lord for being able to celebrate today with all those they left behind
588434 growing up i was angry and resentful at other families because they seemed fully intact id often lay awake at night wondering why our family had to be different
588435 i came to the stark realization that the good lord wanted us to be raised under the guiding hands of my grandfather who was a giant of a man hes still my hero hes the big reason im standing here today at the summit of pro footballs greatest shrine
588436 and now im here and i feel that i belong here because i know what to do with this
588437 to all the mothers and fathers who are raising children i offer you this
588438 youre looking at a man that has a lot of blemishes and scars dealt to him by lifes highs and lows but youre also looking at a man who stood tall in the arena and never quit even though it looked like the game was over on many many occasions

588453 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
588454 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
588455 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
588456 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
588457 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
588458 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
588459 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
588460 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
588461 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
588462 in a few seconds you will be given the privilege of being the first people to see the greatest find in the history of our civilization
588463 we have found several other extraterrestrial creatures fossilized but mostly fragments or incomplete skeletons this however was not moved to a vault and prepared for shipment back to the home world like the others we thought this was too important a find to risk damaging by shipping
588464 you invited us here to examine this incredible find i presume
588465 yes the reason you were invited here was for this i thank you for your patience as im sure it was annoying during you trip to not know where you were going or for what purpose
588466 this find makes up for any inconvenience we may have had could you please allow us to be with the fossil alone im sure you have other things you need to attend to director
588467 i cant tell you how it died i know nothing about it but i can tell you that it must have died somewhere underground maybe in some kind of cave in
588468 most likely not there are no broken bones from what i can tell i imagine that this is the skull it has the jaws eye sockets and a third hole that im not certain of because of the eyes i can assume that this also held the brain
588469 look at the digits do you think it had claws
588470 maybe though they look too flexible it has a lot of digits doesnt it
588471 from the teeth i can assume it was an omnivore eating both meat and plants i also think it might have been bipedal but i cant tell for sure
588472 hold on im going to take some notes on this
588473 well i was thinking this thing is a lot like us do you think it might have been intelligent
588474 i doubt it was intelligent the brain case was too small a brain that tiny could never become as intelligent as us i dont even see how it could make tools or manipulate the environment with all those digits either
588475 what was this planet called i never bothered to ask
588476 this planet is called earth it is the third body orbiting the star sol our study confirms that it was once much like our home world and had life nothing intelligent from what we can tell though
588477 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
588478 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
588479 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
588480 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
588481 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
588482 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
588483 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
588484 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
588485 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
588486 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
588487 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
588488 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
588489 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
588490 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
588491 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
588492 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
588493 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
588494 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
588495 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members
588496 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are
588497 i told myself when i get to be a man ill live here
588498 im sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
588499 i aint got no matches but i got a long ways to go
588500 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
588501 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
588502 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
588503 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
588504 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
588505 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget

588629 dalam undangan ataupun acara di desa seperti ada kegiatan kami sebelum memberikan sambutan pasti mengabsen dulu semua aparatnya termasuk kepala dusun se dekatagung termasuk bila ada warga yang meninggaldunia untuk tahlilan dihari kedua semua aparatnya diwajibkan untuk hadir kerumah berduka
588630 semenjak kami jadi kepala desa tidak ada satupun warga kami berurusan dengan pihak berwajib artinya warga kami kesadaran untuk hukumnya sangat tinggi bila ada permasalahan aparat pasti bergerak sesuai kedudukannya tidak ada satupun warganya berurusan dengan polisi kalau polisi datang ke rumah itupun hanya untuk minta tandatangan tiap bulan sebagai laporan semua kepala seluruh bawean

588633 semua bukti hak atas tanah itu sudah kami sampaikan ke bpn tapi sampai sekarang juga tidak ada kelanjutannya
588634 ini kan aneh kami selaku ahli waris tidak menerima pemberitahuan pencabutan hak tanah yang kami kuasai
588635 perlawanan hukum jelas akan kami lakukan jika hak kami tidak terpenuhi
588636 hak mereka sudah dicabut sehingga ganti rugi tanaman itu diberikan kepada mereka yang mengerjakan
588637 jadi tidak benar temuan lsm environment parliament watch epw ganti rugi hanya diberikan kepada 71 orang
588638 ya tidak masalah kalau data camat lebih banyak kan tinggal dicek saja data siapa yang valid dan apakah benar mereka yang menerima ganti rugi itu penggarap betulan atau hanya sekedar nama saja
588639 kami minta kepada polisi agar serius dalam menangani kasus ini karena yang terlibat adalah pejabat desa yang semestinya memberikan contoh yang baik kepada masyarakat jangan main begitu apalagi nanti kalau penggunaan uangnya tak jelas kan juga bisa masuk tindak pidana korupsi

588645 coming on top of the proteas most successful season ever this is the most wonderful start to a new era for south african cricket
588646 it was most fitting that graeme smith led the proteas to this historic victory and his innings proved that he is really captain colossus
588647 the vision of cricket south africa is to grow the game in all communities and to be the best cricket nation in the world the series victory against england showed that we are on the right road to achieve this vision
588648 in many ways it is a great pity that we are not at home to share this moment with all south africans it is a great moment for the team as an away series win in england was one of the targets we had set ourselves along with the away series in australia and the one in india which we drew
588649 but if you look at the bigger picture this is a huge result for our country we think of those who came before us and tried so hard to achieve this victory of those who never had the opportunity to achieve it and of course of all our fans
588650 marks unbeaten knock in the first innings did a lot for his confidence as he has not had many batting opportunities on this tour and his experience showed in the end there was still a lot of work to be done when he arrived at the crease

588693 when directing me to transmit to your excellency the enclosed document publication of which is imminent his holiness strongly recommended that i draw your attention to its importance and to the necessity of a concerted effort on the part of the entire catholic episcopate
588694 and now he turns to his brothers the bishops of the catholic world asking them to stand beside him more firmly than ever in this circumstance and to help him present this delicate point of the churchs teaching to the christian people to explain and justify its profound reasons
588695 the pope counts upon the attachment of his brothers in the episcopate to the chair of peter upon their love for the church upon their concern for the true good of souls
588696 it is necessary that both in the confessional and in the pulpit in the press and by other means of social communication every necessary pastoral effort be made that no ambiguity exists among the faithful or in public opinion concerning the churchs position in this serious matter

588716 it was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around i dug a tunnel through the sand that was blocking the entrance to the bunkers and what i saw blew me away it was as if the german soldiers had left only yesterday
588717 it was a race against the clock because of the risk of looters we lied to keep them at bay saying that there was only one furnished bunker and that it was guarded around the clock which wasnt true but even so there were two attempted break ins
588718 it was surprising to see the soldiers living conditions in the bunkers
588719 disgusted that people want to attract tourists to this kind of garbage
588720 was not from the bronze age what has been found is incredibly authentic and tells us a lot about how they lived in these bunkers
588721 we dont expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved maybe its because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum
588722 world war ii and its memories will not just go away and discoveries like these breathe new life into the story and the fascination that still surrounds this war

588924 ed if we can actually wrap this up sooner id rather do that i can wait
588925 you coming in or you just going to stand there talking to me through the door
588926 remember me telling you that tonight is steve and darlenes anniversary
588927 yeah arent we supposed to be going over there tomorrow night to help them celebrate it
588928 yes but something i didnt tell you was that darlene asked me to do her a little favor for their special night tonight
588929 well she wanted to do something a little special a little naughty for steve but she needed my help because it was something shes never done before
588930 but shes never done that before and she was a little nervous about doing it so she asked me
588931 i never went into work weve had this planned so i took the day off to give her a hand
588932 i thought as part of your surprise tonight youd enjoy knowing and hearing about that
588933 i cant believe she actually asked you if you would do it
588934 yeah sort of surprised me too but theres more though just shaving her telling you about it and what i have planned was pretty much the entire surprise there is a tiny bit more but ill save that for a little later
588935 ah huh well that and perhaps a bit more than that
588936 so you interested in shaving your cute little wifes quim or not
588937 well youve always wanted me to do it for one thing but for another the more i thought about shaving darlenes pussy
588938 the more it began to excite and arouse me as well so i thought what the hell why not do it once and just see what it was like for the fun of it so you ready or would you just rather i do it
588939 well thats sort of the really interesting part but before i tell you you have to promise to concentrate on what youre doing or ill stop you and finish doing it myself
588940 anyway after id finished cutting off as much of her pubic hair with the scissors as i could we decided it would be a lot easier for both of us if we just stood in the shower together while i actually shaved her
588941 remember now concentrate or ill wait and tell you the rest of it after were done here
588942 naturally it was easier for me to undress as well
588943 as i began shaving her i could feel her tremble
588944 looking up i noticed that her eyes were closed she was of course holding on to the balance bar inside the shower for support but her free hand was actually cupping her breast
588945 looking up at her as she stood there with her eyes closed obviously aroused by what i was doing soon had me feeling very aroused too
588946 well thats when she sort of opened her eyes looked down at me and noticed me kneeling there looking up at her
588947 so there i was looking at her she looking down at me obviously aroused
588948 dont know why i did it really just a spur of the moment thing but in the next instant i allowed my finger to slide up the groove of her quim felt the little knot of her exposed clitoris and then tickled it
588949 patience baby you need a little more cream over on this side
588950 oh yeah exactly i began to slowly finger fuck her now bare little quim shit matt even i couldnt believe i was doing it or that she was allowing me too i mean its not like we discussed it or even imagined anything like that might happen it just did
588951 after you finish shaving me and then eating me ill tell you the rest after
588952 she asked me if id be willing to shave steve hes always wanted her too but shes always been afraid to do so in fear of really nicking him up so she asked me provided of course you were ok with it
588953 no not really but where would darlene and i be during all this
588954 darlene wanted to be but she also told me that she wanted to do something else while i did
588955 suck you off she thought it was only fair that she do that if you were to be ok with me shaving her husband
588956 what about steve doesnt he have some sort of say in all this
588957 mas buscad primeramente el reino de dios y su justicia y todas estas cosas os ser n a adidas
588958 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
588959 its exciting and ill have time to enjoy personal accolades in the offseason but what were doing right now as a team is a little more exciting
588960 finally we put up a big number for the pitching staff and i think they needed that mentally from grinding it out
588961 everybody knows we havent been hitting with runners in scoring position with nobody out or two outs
588962 we just havent done the job youve got to go out and win ballgames
588963 weve hung around 500 and got a little over we just havent been able to take the next step to get something really rolling

588966 feldman goes out there and pitches his tail off its frustrating to see him pitch that well and then lose the game its my fault that we lost that game
588967 hopefully i can go out and relax like i did against the mariners and keep us in the games
588968 zabs a warrior and he wanted to continue to fight
588969 i was winning and im very disappointed with the whole situation and how it ended
588970 he hit me with some uppercuts but i never felt anything
588971 i didnt want to be remembered just as a contender
588972 i wanted to be remembered as a champion i had to go all over the world to fight but now theyll always have to recognize me as the ibf champion
588973 he pushed me out of the gym but i pushed him out of the ring
588974 that was how i got even i pushed him right of the ring
588975 we just have to play better everybody has to play better myself included
588976 i didnt care if i gave up 15 runs i wanted to get a win
588977 i just live day by day pitch by pitch sometimes theyre going to get me sometimes im going to get them thats part of the game im not trying to hit home runs i just want to make good contact
588978 i was trying to challenge the hitters i was just thinking throw strikes and let them hit it thats what i was thinking the whole game
588979 hope you enjoyed your moment steve because now its on like donkey kong
588980 i have to get used to this so into me and i like it im blessed to be here

589024 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all casa spokesman peter gibson said today
589025 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
589026 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
589027 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
589028 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
589029 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
589030 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
589031 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
589032 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
589033 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
589034 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
589035 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
589036 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
589037 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
589038 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
589039 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
589040 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
589041 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
589042 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
589043 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
589044 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
589045 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
589046 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
589047 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
589048 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
589049 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
589050 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
589051 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
589052 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
589053 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
589054 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
589055 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
589056 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
589057 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
589058 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
589059 ive been in business for 18 years im aware that theres fraud out there
589060 but they looked so legitimate their website was so elaborate
589061 we manage our extensive network of ticket agents through our three international offices london new york and sydney
589062 if i failed to recognise this internet scam very few other individuals with less of an e commerce background would have had a chance
589063 so i can empathise with others in the same position
589064 i work for a fairly large software company and the team i manage is responsible for dealing with internet crime
589065 so it was quite amusing to everyone at work that i had been scammed on the internet
589066 the scene was overwhelming and i cant explain the stench
589067 every room was filled with animals and they were in the beds and everywhere

589070 we have quietly been working on sustainability issues at duke for about a decade
589071 its going to be a yearly rating were hoping to rate more schools
589072 the best way to foster environmental stewardship is to expose our students faculty and staff to a campus that models these principles
589073 i think everybody is interested in it not just students
589074 the no 1 goal was to create the webs most powerful one stop information resource for concerned consumers
589075 i dont know people were seeing international players getting better it would have happened eventually
589076 people that are concerned about the relationship between driving faster and using more gas have every right to slow down on their own
589077 the amount you save varies from one vehicle to another but if you talk about lowering your speed from 65 mph to 55 it would be somewhere in the 7 to 10 percent range
589078 and this idea is a better deal for those vehicles that have lower fuel economy for say an unaerodynamic suv the savings you get from reducing your speed are more significant
589079 people want to be free to run down the highway at whatever speed they can but there is a need right now especially for environmental reasons to conserve fuel
589080 it would just be a terrible thing to lose it
589081 people are on guard for not having chapel hill become a generic place
589082 this is almost a test case its a line in the sand for how chapel hill is going to grow
589083 there has to be a delicate balance to preserve the idealized chapel hill that people come here for but still grow as a town and i think that unwise growth and unwise development could really hamper and destroy the things we love about this town and brought us here
589084 really i thought this was my last stop before god
589085 glen lennox has become one of the iconic places in chapel hill not because of its architecture and not because of its layout but because of the people who have lived there and the life experiences theyve had over the last 50 years
589086 when you take that and say were going to take out every trace of that neighborhood i think people are justifiably appalled
589087 from what happened in his last start its kind of hard to feel as confident as i was for the derby and those other races
589088 but i feel as confident as i can be that hes going to run his race
589089 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen today because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i have no idea
589090 but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with him hes just not going to run anymore stuff like that you know
589091 big brown is the story and rightfully so and we hope our horses come to play and see what happens
589092 he shining hes happy you know if he wasnt going into this race as good as he could go into a race we would wait on the next spot but hes on top of his game hes doing great he looks great so i have to say that everything is all good
589093 but the riders and horses will see us every day
589094 weve been involved in many different international organizations since then and he drew on international experts he knows for this team
589095 some of our research here at n c state into tendon and ligament diseases fits well with this kind of event and weve been friends for many years so it kind of came together that way about two years ago
589096 it involves people equipment information money everything its the synchronization of all of that youre building a huge organization and the lifespan of that organization is maybe eight years when you consider they got the games in 2000 its like putting together a whole company like ibm and then after the games they dismantle it
589097 we believe the fourth quarter will be a very telling quarter
589098 our intention was to treat this like a private sector deal
589099 i think thats what some people have not fully grasped
589100 people dont want the city to compete with them unfairly but its a market lease and a market up fitting
589101 its unique enough that i dont think theres a standard operating procedure for handling it
589102 tom and i have talked it over quite a bit but we knew all along that its going to have to be a very fluid project
589103 with this many guys there are going to be a lot of individual ups and downs one day one of them is going to look better than the rest the next day itll be someone else its going to take some patience from us
589104 who plays how much and when wednesday will have to depend on how everyone looks in the practices leading up to the scrimmage
589105 all of them reported in very good condition it was clear during the first practice that theyd all done their offseason work
589106 the pieces are in place for our offense and that includes quarterback
589107 we may not know which one is going to be the starter yet but everyone on the team knows what those guys can do the quarterback position wont be a problem for us

589160 on the basis of the sacrifice of jesus christ have you repented of your sins and dedicated yourself to jehovah to do his will
589161 do you understand that your dedication and baptism identify you as one of jehovahs witnesses in association with gods spirit directed organization
589162 these vows are publicly made often in front of thousands of people now the discerning reader should also attempt to reconcile the jehovahs witness baptismal criteria wherever possible to 2nd thessalonians 2 4 and our lord jesus christs commandment at matthew 28 19
589163 baptismal candidates must acknowledge publicly that on the basis of jesus sacrifice they have repented of their sins and have dedicated themselves to jehovah they must also understand that dedication and baptism identify them as jehovahs witnesses
589164 the entire baptismal arrangement including this public expression of faith is essential for salvation
589165 explain to us the illustration of the weeds in the field
589166 the sower of the fine seed is the son of man 38 the field is the world as for the fine seed these are the sons of the kingdom but
589167 come on let us build ourselves a city and also a tower with its top in the heavens and let us make a celebrated name f or ourselves for fear we may be scattered over all the surface of the earth
589168 then if anyone says to you look here is the christ or there do not believe it 24 for false christs and false prophets will arise and give great signs and wonders so as to mislead if possible even the chosen ones 25 look i have forewarned you 26 therefore if people say to you look he is in the wilderness do not go out look he is in the inner chambers do not believe it
589169 there are thousands of millions of persons living on earth today millions of these are now learning of the wonderful opportunity of keeping on living upon it
589170 we have concluded a covenant with death and with she ol we have effected a vision the overflowing flash flood in case it should pass through will not come to us for
589171 16 therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah has said
589172 the one who is and who was and who is coming
589173 and you made them a kingdom and priests to our god and they are to rule over the earth
589174 look i am coming as a thief happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments that he may not walk naked and people look upon his shamefulness

589176 too bad too bad you great city babylon you strong city because in one hour your judgment has arrived

589178 babylon the great the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth

589294 multilateralism will be nothing more than the expression of the birth and consolidation of a new multi polar era which some like to call pluripolar and others call poly centric but that definitively is an era aspired to and desired by many for centuries
589295 the most important effort of the peoples to constitute an instance of dialogue brotherhood and respect and to share the plural search for a new world without empires without colonialism without exclusions without racism without dominations of any kind
