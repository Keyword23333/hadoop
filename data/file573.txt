5730019 oh how are you madam good evening please i greated sic her with high respect fine thanks she replied oh please welcome i am sorry i didnt know its you my dear please forgive me eh well they call me richard i stopped almost abruptly with heavy breath as if i was being chased by a lion mine is drosie she replied
5730020 i was a young man still at school i knew nothing about ladies and my mother warned me to keep away from them
5730021 it was her habit that when she struggles she does not yell or speak anything she only uses her eyes to demand or command but not her mouth

5730040 data are the past the question that the fed must wrestle with is what will occur on the inflation front going forward
5730041 might digest and dispatch the recent inflationary surge or he might gag on it it is too early to tell
5730042 the july inflation numbers were absolutely ugly but they probably reflect the peak of inflation there is a lot of evidence showing substantially slower growth in the rest of the world
5730043 if the fed is too slow to raise rates then yeah you could get a more meaningful inflation buildup but thats probably not going to happen

5730057 and then theres origin so you could probably say there is six different projects proposed
5730058 its getting people to appoint a final bid thats the critical issue and clearly that will happen with people having had access to our data room
5730059 origin has failed to demonstrate any confidence that the coal seam gas monetisation process will yield superior value for its shareholders
5730060 their statement that it would be a challenge to be profitable and they dont expect yields to increase at all is pretty grim
5730061 youve just got a lot people who probably dont want to hold that sort of company
5730062 theyve bought toll for a growth company not an airline and when they get the airline theyll probably part with it
5730063 with the outlook really its self evident that fuel prices capacity and yield are going to be key factors going forward and theyre difficult to predict in current circumstances

5730091 is that what you were practicing when i called you on the phone and you said that your head hurt and your eyeballs felt like they were about to pop out
5730092 what if you want to install something not in the package manager
5730093 what if you want to install something not in the package manager windows beats linus hands down
5730094 pacman kde4 and it was soon downloaded and installed and worked honestly how much simpler can you get
5730095 first of all lets face it you are the weakest link in any os
5730096 finally just the fact that linux is open source means that more eyeballs can see bugs and vulnerabilities making it easier to patch any coder in his her moms basement could issue a fix for the community
5730097 it would be a totally different ball game if these pcs had no os on them windows wouldnt come out all that superior i would even wager that linux would probably do a better job
5730098 i am sure when it comes to community other proprietary operating systems do envy us
5730099 long story short after around 2 hours of trying to get an hp printer to work on xp i gave up and plugged into an ubuntu linux eee pc it got recognized in 30 seconds
5730100 it would be a totally different ball game if these pcs had no os on them windows wouldnt come out all that superior i would even wager that linux would probably do a better job
5730101 unlike windows where u have to download a seperate driver for your monitor graphic card chip set keyboard etc
5730102 if a linux installation fail to install a hardware on a system i could just give up right away on windows go to the hardware vendors website and download and install the driver
5730103 when linux fil to install some hardware you often have to do
5730104 download packages type in weird commands that meant i had to download some more stuff as i said weird stuff that i cant remember because of its weirdness
5730105 at the most i used linux for about a month and a half before i went back to windows
5730106 weird stuff that i cant remember because of its weirdness
5730107 i imagine someone who had only been using windows or mac os x for a month and a half

5730117 technology is only a tool to assist you it will not replace human efforts it helps you track down suspicious signs but it does not do well when it comes to preventing crimes

5730122 as the planet becomes an increasingly urban place delivering these life improving essentials to cities big and small is proving more than a challenge
5730123 radical environmental initiatives that pull cars off streets can do wonders but can also kill off passing trade
5730124 new developments designed to attract investment can not only boost local fortunes but also drive out all those people that made the city interesting in the first place
5730125 when i saw the pictures in the papers i was absolutely baffled
5730126 i thought surely no member of the public is going to believe that a board game could be used as a weapon
5730127 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
5730128 a beard can conceal someones identity are the police going to start banning beards
5730129 when we watched the news there was this endless sense of frustration and disbelief that despite the mass marches and protests we were off to war
5730130 we thought it was a ridiculous process that needed to be ridiculed
5730131 the manager of the local borders bookshop in cambridge thought it was a great idea and wanted to trial it
5730132 a day before it was due to appear head office said not to stock it that happened time and time again
5730133 we dont censor our products the game just wasnt selling
5730134 the idea is to encourage the sort of short term selfish thinking that led us into war
5730135 she told me in the middle of the night that she will be home shortly
5730136 she should be here within the next couple of weeks
5730137 i think were all on a high shes over the moon
5730138 the neighbours have been sitting at their tvs all weekend its something else
5730139 i think shes done brilliantly especially as she only turned professional about three years ago and shes reached olympic level
5730140 she played hockey at school and she started off with horseriding before she went to university in dundee then she went to running and did the london marathon she got quite a few medals in running
5730141 ian is a cyclist but not a professional she was soon beating him up hills
5730142 she said she was going in to give it her best and see how she did

5730151 its very difficult for the boxers especially asian boxers because their skills are based on technique
5730152 if he can get another one at this olympics it would mean a lot to the whole of russia
5730153 hopefully i can keep the fun rolling to the 2012 olympics in london
5730154 a lot of boxers want to go pro and win titles but for me the last three years have been all about winning a medal

5730165 five years ago when it started it was a bike ride with just one guy now hundreds are here to support the men and women who fought to keep america free
5730166 i was sad because there wasnt any support when i think of what they did for us we should be there for them
5730167 folks youve heard of the unknown soldier today we have the unknown singer

5730173 but this is just our estimate we dont know and even if microsoft and sony told us i couldnt say because it would be under nda
5730174 but we think in three to four years time although there are good reasons why it should be 2010 already but well see

5730182 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5730183 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5730184 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5730185 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5730186 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5730187 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5730188 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5730189 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5730190 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5730191 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5730192 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5730193 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5730194 the partnership with fora tv enables us to extend georgetowns presence on the world stage by facilitating the transmission of university content enabling further impact on global discussions and the understanding of the most important issues of our time
5730195 fora tv is one example of partnerships were exploring to provide georgetown content in online communities frequented by faculty students and alumni
5730196 we are working to develop more ways to continue to expand georgetowns presence in various social media networks in order to further showcase the important work taking place on campus
5730197 we are excited and privileged to showcase georgetown university programs on the fora tv platform

5730207 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5730208 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5730209 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5730210 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5730211 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5730212 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5730213 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5730214 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5730215 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5730216 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5730217 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5730218 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5730219 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5730220 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5730221 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5730222 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5730223 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5730224 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5730225 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5730226 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5730227 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5730228 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5730229 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5730230 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5730231 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5730232 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5730233 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5730234 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5730235 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5730236 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5730237 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5730238 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5730239 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5730240 who are open to doing something on the production side
5730241 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5730242 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5730243 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5730244 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5730245 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5730246 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5730247 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5730248 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5730249 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5730250 the program has demonstrated its value many times over in the eight plus years that weve run the program
5730251 over 200 000 in grant monies have been awarded and that has stimulated over 2 million in private sector investment in facade enhancement
5730252 our main street looks really good because over 2 million worth of improvements have been done in the last nine years
5730253 its a really great program and were really glad to be able to assist people
5730254 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5730255 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5730256 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5730257 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5730258 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5730259 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5730260 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5730261 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5730262 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

5730264 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5730265 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5730266 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5730267 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5730268 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5730269 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5730270 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5730271 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5730272 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5730273 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5730274 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5730275 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5730276 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5730277 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5730278 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5730279 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5730280 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5730281 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5730282 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5730283 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5730284 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5730285 the playstation 4 and xbox 720 will arrive in 2011 or 2012 we think
5730286 but this is just our estimate we dont know and even if microsoft and sony told us i couldnt say because it would be under nda
5730287 but we think in three to four years time although there are good reasons why it should be 2010 already but well see
5730288 you have to come see what i did with my space
5730289 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women
5730290 anyone could be the next target if doctors are allowed to pick and choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people
5730291 this court is allowing two lesbians to force these individuals to choose between being doctors in the state of california or being able to practice their faith
5730292 we have about 25 per cent of people that say they find maths easy but the other 75 per cent seem to have some sort of disconnect
5730293 so there is something missing in education that we havent properly identified
5730294 nobody is disputing the fact that you need language to build a more complicated set of ideas but language isnt the starter kit
5730295 it isnt just drilling people on numbers counting and how you add two together or how you write down or read numbers it is more than that
5730296 we need methods that map on to these very basic number concepts so you can facilitate the acquisition of numbers and computation
5730297 theyve exceeded the markets expectations on iron ore exports and that is such a powerful driver for them
5730298 the rest of the business is going okay but with iron ore prices doing what they are doing i think it is probably not much more than that pushing it the share price higher
5730299 we gave guidance late last year and the world has really turned on its head since then in terms of costs and prices
5730300 being able to still deliver on that guidance and to do so at the upper end of the range was particularly pleasing
5730301 i think hell be an nba player its just a matter of when is the right time when is his best time
5730302 hes really made a big jump since we got him to now its going to take him some time but i think the rest of it is there
5730303 hes a killer competitor and he has a great attitude and you dont often get that with a guy who has exceptional talent
5730304 somewhere along the line those kind of guys usually get full of themselves and get a little screwed up but he hadnt when we got him and he still hasnt
5730305 i had a good relationship with him when he was a kid and to me hes still little patty
5730306 its great to see him at the olympics i would never have dreamed hed be here so quickly
5730307 it was very scary playing them the first time because theyre the guys who you have posters of up on your wall but for me it was trying to think of them as guys you play in the playground or your local stadium
5730308 our canadian athletes have got the wrong pharmasists this year
5730309 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5730310 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5730311 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5730312 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5730313 we want to solve the mystery of the will of god the way we solve a sudoku or crossword puzzle but in my experience intellectual analysis usually results in spiritual paralysis
5730314 a part of us feels as if something is spiritually wrong with us when we experience circumstantial uncertainty but that is precisely what jesus promised us when we are born of the spirit and start following him most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure

5730405 with just three months to go before the election a lot of folks are still trying to square senator obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge then he confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure this was back when supporting americas efforts in iraq entailed serious political risk it was a clarifying moment it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war thanks to the courage and sacrifice of our soldiers sailors airmen and marines and to brave iraqi fighters the surge has succeeded and yet senator obama still cant quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment instead he commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president whats missing is the judgment to be commander in chief
5730406 he said obamas failure to support the troop surge or acknowledge that it is working combined with his call for a 16 month timetable for withdrawing troops shows
5730407 pentagon insiders say members of the joint chiefs of staff have long opposed the increase in troops and are only grudgingly going along with the plan because they have been promised that the military escalation will be matched by renewed political and economic efforts in iraq gen john p abizaid the outgoing head of central command said less than two months ago that adding u s troops was not the answer for iraq

5730438 i would say the message is we were disappointed with our performance at e3
5730439 there were titles like wario which we think will be really fun titles that we should have showcased
5730440 we were excited that mr miyamoto made the commitment that pikmin is coming it would have been nice if we could have said that on stage but we think it was a good recognition for us that we care for our core fans and not just the new people who are now discovering nintendo

5730443 some open source companies have not truly figured that out

5730449 im going to put my butt on the line by saying that im going to do everything possible and i think everybody in here is going to do everything possible to make sure it dont happen again its not in joes hands anymore its not in anybody
5730450 the general thing that we see are blended threats something very prolific at this point
5730451 the attacks blend email and web threats or email messages that contain links and lures to make you click on the link
5730452 the malware tries to break into your home router and change the dns domain name server so it can redirect you to any website when you start browsing
5730453 it makes use of your network infrastructure and turns it against you
5730454 since security directors consider malicious code a significant threat its no surprise that nearly 50 of enterprises have already adopted personal firewalls and patch management
5730455 by the way searchsecurity com is located at 1 2 3 4
5730456 i dont know but you can find it at searchsecurity techtarget com which is located at 1 2 3 4
5730457 pc tools will help symantec expand its reach with consumers in new emerging regional markets and will bring an array of go to market capabilities that have been effective with consumers in many markets around the world
5730458 there was an issue found at the 11th hour that did not meet our quality bar for broad distribution
5730459 the nature of the control allows the attacker to install it and exploit the vulnerability without any user interaction
5730460 early notification of all potential mitigations for disclosed vulnerabilities especially those critical in nature can only help to better protect enterprise and consumer computer users globally
5730461 this is really geared toward the first 30 days after the release of new updates we always get questions from customers every month about the likelihood that exploit code will be released for a particular update
5730462 the exploitability index is kind of interesting and the first thing i think of is that all of these researchers might see something on the low end of the scale as a challenge
5730463 it will be interesting to see how it tracks with reality there are plenty of other vulnerability scoring systems out there already
5730464 in terms of the advance access to the updates a day or two isnt going to make much difference to us anyway were not in that race it might help the av and ids vendors to have a day or two but anything that gets earlier protection for the customers is a good thing
5730465 theres a lot going on that is supporting all these illicit activities
5730466 its really its own little world operating off of itself and we got an interesting sneak peak at how that world operates
5730467 theyre out in the open for anyone to come and purchase what they have to sell
5730468 phishing is successful because of our reliance on static identifiers
5730469 what we really need is a revamp of the financial system in how identities are established in the real world
5730470 when we get to the point where i can pull your credit report and even with all that information i cant steal your identity thats when weve made some progress rather than a technological band aid which may soften the situation for a while
5730471 basically anybody if they happen to stumble upon the right place would be able to get into this industry and after a day be able to launch their own phishing enterprise
5730472 it will become a much more mainstream defense against phishing
5730473 its turning into the principle means by which a consumer can protect himself
5730474 still consumers need to understand that it doesnt relate to anything about privacy protection and it doesnt mean that the company behind the website is going to be adequately protecting your credit card information
5730475 we realized that the phishing problem isnt just a web page thats being displayed to a user someplace on their home computer
5730476 this whole problem is a symptom of this entire ecosystem that exists to steal identities bank account and credit card information from people
5730477 m aximum number of individual fragments that may be processed at once
5730478 i think apple needs to address this to really get the iphone into the corporate market
5730479 but the problem is apple has left off the on device encryption so if the device is lost yes we can remote wipe it but there is that moment in time between when the device is lost and when it gets reported and when it gets wiped and were just not comfortable with that
5730480 but in general apple is still concentrating on the consumer business and will eventually update the sdk to accommodate more serious enterprise adoption
5730481 apple thinks that if i have activesync and can sync with exchange im done and yes thats a small part of the problem very few users can get by without having connectivity to email but beyond that its security and access
5730482 its a big deal especially in regulated industries like banking
5730483 and it has to be enforceable the it guy needs to be able to say you cant get around an encryption policy you have to do it today that is impossible on the iphone
5730484 but id rather have it and force someone to hack me than not have it at all and give sensitive data away for free
5730485 in this day and age thats how encryption should be
5730486 we should not have to add on a piece of third party software that should be something thats native to the device
5730487 i think it shows a disconnect between whoever was designing the software for the iphone and the corporate market
5730488 were seeing more and more apple products in the enterprise but they havent yet made the commitment to make an enterprise phone or an enterprise desktop its a shame
5730489 im not the most popular guy at my company right now for saying no you cant use it
5730490 apple had better open up the sdk for full device encryption if they want to be taken seriously as a business device
5730491 its not optional i could never see a large enterprise thats security conscious deploying this device its just too risky
5730492 no one releases their threat modeling results because its the keys to the kingdom
5730493 but were going to show each threat weve found and the mitigations we have for them and then ask people to give us feedback on the whole thing
5730494 we want the feedback on the mitigation while were still in the design and implementation phase when its just a code change on a whiteboard rather than having to go and re architect a component
5730495 it will be useful for the rest of the development world to see what a large complex application looks like when its broken down into components like this
5730496 but we think with the feedback we get from this initiative well have people helping us identify new threats that we havent considered yet
5730497 we want to make this available to smaller development organizations so that they can get started on these kinds of processes as well
5730498 even if they dont have a lot of resources they can use this to teach themselves
5730499 they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions thats completely game over
5730500 what this means is that almost any vulnerability in the browser is trivially exploitable
5730501 a lot of exploit defenses are rendered useless by browsers aslr and hardware dep are completely useless against these attacks
5730502 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista
5730503 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force
5730504 this is not insanely technical these two guys are capable of the really low level technical attacks but this is simple and reusable
5730505 i definitely think this will get reused soon sort of like heap spraying was
5730506 we focused on doing this really fast in the context of an embedded system this was an optimization exercise
5730507 we are doing this as small as possible to demonstrate that it is possible to infect an ios image on the fly without someone noticing
5730508 if this is going to take two hours to update youre going to suspect something suspicious
5730509 the lightweight static analyzer is fast enough to run unnoticed within bootup and compact enough be used as exploit payload
5730510 if youre not making sure that the compromised code is not in charge at the time you are doing an upgrade the rootkit could intercept the functions to write those new files to remain infected
5730511 i want them to suspect if someone because a particular vulnerability is discovered in the future got into their system then they have to take extra measures to upgrade to make sure what is in there doesnt survive
5730512 we did this research on ios because it makes sense but this work applies to a range of devices
5730513 theres a reason why so many people had so many things to speculate about because theres a ton of different paths that lead to doom
5730514 dns should not have been capable of this much damage
5730515 why was such a stupid simple bug capable of breaking this many things
5730516 we had a choice back at our summit in march
5730517 we could either do point fixes or we could drop the sledge hammer and finally raise the odds from one out of 65 000 to one out of hundreds of millions
5730518 over coming months and days its going to drop down to hours and seconds again for attackers to pull off a successful exploit as they get more bandwidth available
5730519 its going to be race between getting dnssec deployed and getting machines and more bandwidth
5730520 this ruling will deny physicians and other professionals the ability to freely exercise their religious convictions
5730521 by forcing healthcare professionals to choose between conscience and career we will lose doctors nurses and other healthcare professionals who are already in short supply
5730522 medical experts already project that existing shortages of nurses physicians and pharmacists will soon worsen failing to meet future healthcare needs legal action to compel healthcare providers to participate in procedures to which they conscientiously object threatens to make the already dangerous situation disastrous
5730523 it defies common sense that a patient would want a doctor to violate his or her conscience in practicing medicine a diminished physician population is not good for medical care

5730531 to make sure that a second record is even going to happen this album needs to get off the ground and we need to tour to support it
5730532 we had been talking about recording in the fall probably since april or may
5730533 its hard to say that we knew thats what we needed to do but thats what we felt we should be doing is continuing on sometimes even after that it was hard to know whether we were doing the right thing
5730534 john offered a lot of ideas in terms of melodic ideas or chord structures or lyrics he was a huge part of the songwriting process

5730536 its modeled after what john was like as a person
5730537 sounds a bit more cohesive as a full unit and maybe a little more developed we had a little more time to figure out the sound of the individual instruments or the songs themselves
5730538 we were exploring the spectrum of sonic possibilities and trying to come up with a good balance
5730539 nothing that we were too interested in doing were waiting until the right one comes along
5730540 for most small service providers it is too expensive to run their own 24 7 data centers using parallels automation we are able to offer integrated exchange 2007 at attractive price points
5730541 moreover resellers can easily customize the parallels software to brand their own hosted services without the significant investment that is typically required
5730542 mesh solutions offers system integrators it consultants internet agencies and resellers easy access to the growing hosting market
5730543 leveraging parallels automation the company can now create additional revenue and improve customer retention without investing in hardware or technical know how

5730614 but as for me and my house we will serve the lord
5730615 far be it from us to forsake the lord to serve other gods 17 it was the lord our god himself who brought us and our fathers up out of egypt from that land of slavery and performed those great signs before our eyes he protected us on our entire journey and among all the nations through which we traveled 18 and the lord drove out before us all the nations including the amorites who lived in the land we too will serve the lord because he is our god
5730616 you are not able to serve the lord he is a holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your rebellion and your sins 20 if you forsake the lord and serve foreign gods he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you after he has been good to you
5730617 you are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the lord
5730618 throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the lord the god of israel
5730619 a judge has denied a warner bros motion to dismiss
5730620 surprisingly fox said it would rather see the film killed instead of collecting a percentage of the box office
5730621 i think an arts centre is about pushing the boundaries in one hand providing people with what they are comfortable with and on the other hand trying to stretch them a little bit
5730622 because the windsor arts centre did not have a history of groundbreaking new theatre we are starting from scratch we are trying to get in touch with young writers small touring groups and small productions of an experimental nature
5730623 was in on it lo is always super bitchy thats just how she is
5730624 want to jinx it the last time i dated a guy for more than one date was brody and that was when heidi and spencer set is up thats how long its been for me
5730625 spencer just moved back in and were trying to work things out and she doesnt know that hes there because i havent had time to tell her
5730626 i dont need them knowing every detail of my relationship
5730627 im just concerned i dont want you to have to sacrifice anything else for your relationship
5730628 theyre the people i go out with whenever i am not here
5730629 the issue is that we all moved in with the idea that the relationship was going to grow and it just hasnt happened i feel like weve tried and you havent given very much back to us the blame is being put on me for the reason you and lauren are drifting apart and i dont think thats fair
5730630 i just dont feel like i click with you i always feel like im on the outside theres an attitude i go on vibes and tension and energy people give off and now i dont care about really really overly trying anymore i have friends that treat me good and i feel included and you dont do that but i just dont care well never be friends
5730631 what results is a sequence of contradictions gaps and omissions of stunning gravity
5730632 only fifteen other states had composite scores higher than montana students
5730633 what is particularly significant is that only four of those higher scoring states had a larger percentage of their students taking the act test than in montana the other eleven states had only a small percentage of their students take the test these are generally their very best students
5730634 over the past several years montanas overall act scores have remained relatively stable in 2000 the montana composite was 21 8 and in 2006 it was 21 9 this year montanas composite is 22 0
5730635 these results are similar to the national trend in which scores were at 21 0 in 2000 and are at 21 1 in 2004
5730636 while montana students have consistently scored higher than students on the national level we should be looking for ways to prepare our students to improve those scores
5730637 the most significant indicator of how well students will do on the act tests is whether or not they have taken college preparatory classes in high school
5730638 si yo fuera a leer incluso a contestar todos los ataques que me dirigen habr a que cerrar esta tienda para ocuparme nicamente de ese negocio yo act o lo mejor que puedo y mejor me parece y pienso seguir haci ndolo hasta el final si al final el resultado es bueno lo que se diga en contra m a no tendr ninguna importancia pero si al final el resultado es malo y aunque diez ngeles juraran que yo ten a raz n no habr a ninguna diferencia igual estar a mal

5730641 but john mccain has the best record of any republican running for president on the energy issue and on climate change
5730642 im very encouraged about where the presidential rhetoric is in this campaign
5730643 our guy is good but the other guy isnt bad
5730644 as he pulled into his apartment complex he noticed two guys standing on the corner they approached him one with a rifle one with a pistol pulled it on him carjacked him then robbed him
5730645 peugeot thrilled our fans with their stunningly beautiful cars leading edge clean diesel technology and fantastic speed
5730646 our fans at petit le mans powered by the totally new mazda6 are in for the same treat peugeots decision to enter confirms the prestige this cornerstone event has attained i think peugeot is looking at racing in the american le mans series as unfinished business and i suspect they will pick up where they left off last march at sebring
5730647 as last junes le mans showed it takes experience to take on a competitor that has the benefit of 10 years of this race behind it and which stays fit by contesting more races during the season compared with peugeot namely in the american le mans series in which it faces opponents like porsche and acura petit le mans is about traffic safety car interventions and strategy but it is above all 1 000 miles or up to 10 hours of fierce racing which is sufficient to enable us to collect some very valuable data and information

5730653 huge compliance costs as businesses scramble to exploit the loopholes with the result of less revenue for the government
5730654 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
5730655 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
5730656 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
5730657 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
5730658 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
5730659 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
5730660 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
5730661 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
5730662 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
5730663 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
5730664 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
5730665 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
5730666 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
5730667 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
5730668 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
5730669 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
5730670 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
5730671 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
5730672 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
5730673 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
5730674 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
5730675 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
5730676 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
5730677 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
5730678 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
5730679 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
5730680 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
5730681 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
5730682 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
5730683 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
5730684 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
5730685 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
5730686 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
5730687 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
5730688 ich habe ein wenig zeit mit meiner familie und freunden verbraucht aber die meiste zeit war ich mit training besch ftigt
5730689 auf valencia freue ich mich schon lange denn es ist nicht nur eine neue strecke sondern auch ein neuer stra enkurs ich kann das wochenende kaum erwarten die atmosph re wird zweifellos fantastisch denn die spanier haben eine gro e leidenschaft f r die formel 1
5730690 valencia sollte unseren auto gut liegen also hoffe ich dass ich ein gutes rennen haben werde und etwas positives aus spanien mitnehmen werde
5730691 ich freue mich auf ein gutes rennen in valencia die neue strecke sieht gro artig aus und sollte wirklich interessant sein wie auch in monaco und montreal funktioniert unser auto gut auf dieser art von rennstrecke also hoffe ich dass wir hier gut sein werden

5730696 basically weve always stored bull semen since we started collecting it back in the 1960s
5730697 but if anything happens it would be prudent to split samples and specimens off for back up purposes just like you would back up a computer hard drive
5730698 i find that being out in the sun is better for you than people think like when i started going back to the beach and being in the saltwater and the sun my skin improved a lot so i benefit from sunshine
5730699 i am hoping we are striking at the right time
5730700 we know we ought to do x but here are a set of idiosyncratic reasons why we cant at the moment and were working on alleviating them
5730701 democracy is the right form of government for western countries
5730702 the days of overthrowing leaders by military means in europe those days are gone

5730705 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5730706 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5730707 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5730708 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5730709 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5730710 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5730711 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5730712 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5730713 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5730714 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane
5730715 today the administration and the blm turned their backs yet again on western slope communities
5730716 the blms decision to cover its eyes and ears and rush ahead with todays auction not only puts our land and water and wildlife at risk it has shortchanged the american taxpayer
5730717 intent ver si estoy en buenas condiciones y despu s control a mis rivales con la vista para no forzar de cara a la final del mi rcoles
5730718 esto va a ser m s duro para m ya que he tenido que correr en cuatro series de 100 metros y esta es la primera vez que he tenido que hacer ocho rondas en una competici n
5730719 el objetivo de cualquier atleta es venir a los juegos ol mpicos hacer un buen tiempo y ganar una medalla eso es lo que quiero hacer me gustar a correr en la final en 19 4 o 19 5 o incluso m s r pido
5730720 me gusta divertirme en la pista ya que me gusta lo que hago no hay tomarse el trabajo en serio
5730721 deben ser espec ficos con metas definidas y deben ser evaluados por una instancia que satisfaga a todos pero principalmente que satisfaga a la sociedad que sea de ciudadanos que no est n vinculados con legisladores ni con autoridades esa instancia tendr que dar cortes trimestrales o semestrales de c mo van los compromisos por ejemplo el senado se va comprometer a realizar modificaciones al c digo penal federal
5730722 la cuesti n es ver d nde se encuentra la impunidad en d nde est en los cuerpos policiacos en los ministerios p blicos en los jueces en el sistema penitenciario carcelario en la falta de coordinaci n de instancias en la falta de un sistema nacional de polic a
5730723 la lucha en la calle es muy violenta pero es m s eficaz contra los criminales de cuello blanco y que puede darse sin violencia porque se puede identificar una cuenta es importante trabajar en un sistema de inteligencia que no tenemos
5730724 repruebo totalmente la visi n esa de que reprobaron ya que a los ni os no los podemos llamar reprobados a veces los chavos en cierta rea no saben bien y es nuestro deber como sistema educativo prepararlos para que salgan bien porque quiere decir que el m todo no estuvo bien
5730725 podamos conservar una buena relaci n para cumplir con el pa s y con el presidente del mandato que se nos ha dado por elevar la calidad educativa
5730726 honestly right now the record is important but its more important for me to do what i have to do to keep going i am not a quitter i will stay off my feet today ice take the prednisone that the doctor prescribed ill get back out there
5730727 ill be fresh and like new when i can run again my legs are bomber besides this acute pain
5730728 you have no idea how frustrated i am right now
5730729 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
5730730 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
5730731 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
5730732 very rare case reports of pancreatitis with complications or with a fatal outcome
5730733 i became interested in the ways people cheat when our hospital started drug testing
5730734 i went home and called some 800 numbers i found online and found i could buy anything i wanted to falsify a test as long as i gave them my credit card number
5730735 some people think if you spend all this money and some of these products cost a lot they will work
5730736 employees know they will be tested employers tell them their places are drug free
5730737 medical defense and airline industries have been testing aggressively for years
5730738 but now its common in other industries too including construction utilities and education thanks to increased awareness of substance abuse employers not only screen employees but also do random testing after people are hired
5730739 thanks to the internet these companies will always be out there with new products
5730740 but the fbi and dea drug enforcement administration are actively pursuing them and more industries such as transportation are making their employers more aware of the products and how employees try to use them to cheat
5730741 i did not know oxygen personally but my sister did
5730742 the objective is to get to the top of as many towers as you can
5730743 you try to reach the hardest summit sometimes by jumping
5730744 jumping requires fearlessness a fair amount of agility and a high threshold for pain
5730745 back then there were several jumpers in on the scene
5730746 a few of the old timers say that jumping has no place here
5730747 but there is always some lunatic who goes crazy for it and becomes the dominant jumper in the region
5730748 getting stoned with savages a trip through the islands of fiji and vanuatu
5730749 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
5730750 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
5730751 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
5730752 senator mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues for the good of our country i wish he had been right and i had been wrong but thats not what history shows
5730753 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5730754 as omb director he talked bush into the presidents first veto of his entire administration
5730755 while we know this settlement will never ease the pain of those enduring enormous heartbreak it does bring years of court proceedings to an end
5730756 to have a fire inspector miss the foam on several occasions i just dont see how they would have survived the scrutiny of a trial
5730757 how can they decide that all 100 that died and all that was burned and everything all the survivors that their lives are only worth 10 million

5730759 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
5730760 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
5730761 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
5730762 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
5730763 two physicists have boldly gone where no reputable scientists should go and devised a new scheme to travel faster than the speed of light
5730764 brachytherapy may be the preferable treatment for obese men with early stage prostate cancer
5730765 being overweight does not present any unique technical challenges for brachytherapy as it does for surgery and external beam
5730766 we show that a highly desired attribute of the job authority comes with some interpersonal costs but those costs arent distributed equally across key social groups
5730767 in these experiments we are asking a very fundamental question how can we better understand the detailed properties of neutrinos
5730768 in order to understand neutrino mixing and oscillations we must know the value of the unknown mixing angle
5730769 all we know so far is that it is small
5730770 this would show that the neutrino is its own antiparticle
5730771 currently some evidence suggests that neutrinos are different from antineutrinos while certain theories predict that they are actually the same particle it is important to understand whether those theories are true or not
5730772 there should have been equal amounts of matter and anti matter present at the big bang the beginning of the universe
5730773 today however matter dominates our earth explaining why we dont annihilate each other when we shake hands if the neutrino turns out to be its own antiparticle this might help us to understand more about this imbalance
5730774 a very powerful flashlight directed at the moon would theoretically create a bright spot on its surface by simply turning the flashlight sideways the flashlights beam streaks across the sky at speeds far exceeding the speed of light this evidence has long been known and dismissed since the bright spot cannot be used for superluminal or faster than light communication between the earth and the moon the fast motion of the bright spot is simply a geometrical artifact similar in some ways to the point at which the two blades of closing scissors intersect the theory of relativity does not concern such purely geometrical objects
5730775 this is going to raise the bar for mining in idaho
5730776 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
5730777 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas
5730778 teachers are back in their rooms getting their rooms prepared
5730779 its nice to see it getting back to where we should be at this time of the year and its nice to know the community has been so supportive

5730791 by outlining specific barriers to use in this population we provide a framework for future early interventions such as parent education and addressing confidentiality concerns
5730792 multiple misconceptions such as side effects that are not known to occur and concerns about confidentiality exist in this population and may influence future use
5730793 for the first time we present an experimental setup that allows measuring the subtle forces both physical and chemical that arise when single hairs slide past each other or are pressed against each other

5730802 we dont have the processes in space to remove excess heat or keep the spacecraft warm in excess cold
5730803 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial currently there is no way to do it for very small spacecraft
5730804 people industries and society itself must be given incentives to change their behavior and patterns of consumption some of the most successful incentives are and will be economic others will have to take the form of regulations
5730805 een van de redenen dat ik weiger me in te laten met het hele beveiligingscircus is dat het volgens mij een verheerlijking is en daarmee een stimulans van het verkeerde gedrag het maakt helden van beveiligingsmensen alsof de mensen die gewoon de normale bugs oplossen niet belangrijk zijn in feite zijn al die saaie normale bugs vele malen belangrijker al was het maar omdat er zo veel meer van zijn

5730812 iedere situatie waarin het de leverancier mogelijk wordt gemaakt weken of maandenlang een bug onder de pet te houden is onacceptabel net als iedere situatie waarin het voor mensen die problemen vinden lastiger wordt om in contact te komen met technische mensen
5730813 die hele embargos zijn goed mentaliteit is gewoon verloedering bij de leveranciers
5730814 maar aan de andere kant moet openbaarmaking niet het doel zijn

5730816 we are doing everything we can to alleviate those concerns
5730817 those people were dealing with are already out there in the streets what were trying to do is help them get off the streets
5730818 we have similar concerns about a shelter being that close to our schools
5730819 of course there are already homeless in that area but when you open a program that is specific to serve mental health needs youre inviting a concentration of persons who may be at risk to themselves and others
5730820 we have to fix the system or it will be a long time before the economy recovers
5730821 the general public wants some standards that they can respect and be protected by on a national basis
5730822 invariably somebodys ox gets gored but right now we dont have a uniformed standard and thats part of the problem
5730823 sen casey believes that a disturbing byproduct of the increased rates of foreclosure as shown by these ap stories is an increase in the number unscrupulous individuals who corrupt the appraisal process to artificially inflate home prices to increase profits by cheating home buyers

5730850 some might say this suggests that parents should have their kids attend
5730851 surprisingly the importance of religion to teens had very little impact on their educational outcomes
5730852 that suggests that the act of attending church the structure and the social aspects associated with it could be more important to educational outcomes than the actual religion

5730862 we are building on the positive results registered last winter when for the first time in its history air malta transported over half a million passengers
5730863 figures released this month by the association of european airline aea also confirm that air malta was one of the few european airlines that registered double digit growth from january till june this year the industry figures confirm that in the first six months of the year air malta transported 14 6 more passengers
5730864 the maltese tourism industry is strongly benefiting from air maltas traffic growth the results and outlook for july and august are also quite positive although double digit growth figures are not projected this is inline with the airlines projected figures for summer as the maltese islands perform very well and both the airline and hotel accommodation figures are very high during peak months

5730867 it is with deep sorrow that i have to tell the people of zambia that our president has passed away this morning
5730868 the peace we currently enjoy should not be taken for granted
5730869 some political parties are disrupting this peace all peace loving zambians must rise and say no to all those preaching violence and chaos in this country
5730870 you people in the west redeem yourself before you begin attacking china
5730871 there is no deal with the president and he had himself resigned

5730893 im just concerned i dont want you to have to sacrifice anything else for your relationship
5730894 theyre the people i go out with whenever i am not here
5730895 the issue is that we all moved in with the idea that the relationship was going to grow and it just hasnt happened i feel like weve tried and you havent given very much back to us the blame is being put on me for the reason you and lauren are drifting apart and i dont think thats fair
5730896 i just dont feel like i click with you i always feel like im on the outside theres an attitude i go on vibes and tension and energy people give off and now i dont care about really really overly trying anymore i have friends that treat me good and i feel included and you dont do that but i just dont care well never be friends

5730903 the outlook is not good but we are giving the calf its only option it cant be fed and in fact we wouldnt know what to feed it because of the fact that it hasnt yet been weaned
5730904 reply by josh willis roger thank you for the comment and the cross link to my blog im glad you enjoyed the gambling analogy but im not gambling on the models or ignoring the joules in the great ocean heat bank im just looking at the bigger picture like the casino owners true ocean heat content is the better metric for global warming and the past few years of no warming are interesting but tacked on to the 50 year record of ocean warming before that the last four years pretty much are just a wiggle and yes the estimates of global surface temperature do have errors and uncertainties but the record of sea surface temperature also shows about 1 degree c of warming over the last 100 years remember the oceans are 2 3 of the earths surface and that record has fewer problems than the temperature data over land between the long term records of ocean heat content land and ocean surface warming global sea level rise about 20 cm over the last 100 years and the increase in atmospheric co2 you get a pretty simple consistent picture of man made warming no models required of course the data are not perfect our understanding and our climate models are missing important pieces of the puzzle but lets not miss the forest for the trees you dont have to count every tree around before you realize youre in the woods just like a casino doesnt have to win every bet to turn a profit despite all the uncertainties i think it is pretty clear that humans have already warmed the planet and if we continue to add more co2 to the atmosphere we will warm it even further
5730905 perhaps the most important aspect of this work is that it establishes a strong constraint on the performance and veracity of anthropogenically forced climate models for example a climate model that reproduces the observed change in global air temperature over the last 50 years but fails to quantitatively reproduce the observed changed in ocean heat content cannot be correct the pcm has a relatively low sensitivity less anthropogenic impact on climate and captures both the ocean and air temperature changes it seems likely that models with higher sensitivity those predicting the most drastic anthropogenic climate changes in the future may have difficulty satisfying the ocean constraint to our knowledge the pcm is the only model currently able to do this and still accurately reflect the changes in surface air temperature over the last 50 years
5730906 the willis et al measured heat storage of 0 62 w m2 refers to the decadal mean for the upper 750 m of the ocean our simulated 1993 2003 heat storage rate was 0 6 w m2 in the upper 750 m of the ocean the decadal mean planetary energy imbalance 0 75 w m2 includes heat storage in the deeper ocean and energy used to melt ice and warm the air and land 0 85 w m2 is the imbalance at the end of the decade

5730911 most american leaders since world war ii have felt a need to demonstrate their willingness to shed blood to protect or advance what they construe as the national interest
5730912 has shown him as a man capable of bold action
5730913 strength but instead by proving that they too want to prosecute wars just perhaps in different places or with different tactics as chairman of the foreign relations committee in 2002 biden also voted to authorize the attack on iraq
5730914 there are times it seems when joe biden can be damned near as dangerous as dick cheney
5730915 we made a bad decision and i take responsibility for making the motion
5730916 that way we dont have to deal with the rosenbaums
5730917 were drawing up boogiemen like eminent domain and the rosenbaums
5730918 centro mayapan is in part here to help generate jobs for low income families and workers many of them older women who have lost jobs and to help revitalize mexican culture

5730921 la mujer obrera works to address the lack of fair wages and jobs available and wants to reconnect women affiliated with the organization to the local economy
5730922 it began as a response to the rights of factory workers in the early 80s but since then has come to include womens leadership and community empowerment
5730923 when centro mayapan opens we have to create at least 100 new jobs and have five to 10 small businesses inside
5730924 places like the media center were thought of to bridge the gap of access and knowledge of technology for people who did not have close proximity to it
5730925 in many cases the source data for the attributes of utility infrastructure is still on the paper plans the munsys geo scan tools provide a powerful way for engineers to have the

5730929 they are like a deer caught in headlights they know they have to move but they cant decide where to go
5730930 police have previously received reports and conducted investigations into the receipt of this kind of material
5730931 we encourage parents whose children come across any forms of child exploitation images and videos or other inappropriate material to contact their nearest police station so it can be investigated
5730932 we are aware of cases where children have been unwittingly exposed to child pornograhy this poses a serious risk and parents need to be vigilaint about their childrens usage of peer to peer networks
5730933 however any such feature is imperfect at best parents should monitor childrens activity
5730934 hes cute hes cuddly hes a great dancer but he is also insane dont call him at a bad time or you may trigger a psychotic episode
5730935 the bear and his manager who is a turtle came into the offices for a creative session and teddy decided he wanted to go back to his real name which is dj teddy z
5730936 but hes back bigger and bolder and is still a great dancer and his manager the turtle will probably be joining him in a new video soon
5730937 it was the word psycho which is closely related to the diagnostic terms of psychosis and psychotic used in conjunction with the bears behaviour when he got the bad text and the fear engendered by his behaviour that offended people
5730938 we acknowledge no on is setting out to cause offence but you are not going to have a ringtone making fun of someone with cancer
5730939 we have to be realistic were not going to be able to do much with the big movie moguls
5730940 they might welcome it to add fuel to their fire
5730941 i know quite a few women who have to return to work early because of financial reasons
5730942 obviously it is of extreme concern to us so we are making investigations and have notified docs
5730943 there is considerable risk involved so we treat it seriously but there is also the chance that the kids may have just been playing in the area
5730944 at this stage docs cannot confirm that the children were living in the bin and were not just playing in the vicinity
5730945 however concerns remain that the children were reportedly in the area on school days were not dressed for the winter weather and were without any adult supervision
5730946 once the children have been located docs will work to secure their ongoing safety and well being
5730947 i was going to make a joke but its pretty inappropriate so i wont
5730948 well pause thats all fine and good but when are we going to do donkey punches
5730949 he instinctively can find the shining greatness of our american culture and does a good job of highlighting it although he also does have those rare lapses when he writes about hockey but that is something caused by impurities in the eastern waters or something

5730953 although many australians dream of living on the coast or in the country in reality the best quality of life in australia is found in the suburbs
5730954 in the suburbs residents often have the best of all worlds with access to good schools modern hospitals and reliable jobs but also large houses fast internet connections and low crime rates
5730955 it was a murder with intention he murdered her in anger because she refused to part with the gadget

5730964 gee if we say that we are going to look stupid silly out of touch wrong or whatever
5730965 theyre looking for people that may be up trees or on cliffs
5730966 youd see boulders four foot in diameter being carried down the stream and whole trees
5730967 we did a lot of praying i told the boys its ok to be scared but were going to be ok
5730968 proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional one billion dollars in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5730969 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not
5730970 and he declared behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5730971 that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5730972 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5730973 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5730974 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5730975 especially considering the sort of players weve got in the squad to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5730976 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5730977 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5730978 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5730979 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it its up to other people to say if im a role model but i wear my heart on my sleeve and give everything for the team
5730980 i think it is a chance to make amends to get another chance now its in my arms and the players to do better
5730981 weve certainly got the players and manager to do that
5730982 my target now is to qualify for the world cup and thats the aim going forward
5730983 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5730984 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players rio is a good player and i like him as a captain
5730985 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team
5730986 i think that showed the manager what kind of character i am to bounce back the way i did after that huge disappointment showed my character maybe that persuaded him
5730987 he gave me a huge boost by giving me the armband in that match i went on the pitch played well and scored the goal it helped to relieve it a bit
5730988 i like to show what i can do on and off the pitch it makes me very proud to think that the likes of capello jose mourinho and luiz felipe scolari have seen something in me to give me the captaincy its very special
5730989 the leaders will discuss the post musharraf resignation issues including the election to the presidency
5730990 they are our important partners and played a critical role in our campaign for impeachment we have conceded to their demand

5730995 the data reveal a remarkable resilience of the smb advertising segment in the face of economic pressures on local consumers and businesses
5730996 theres an opportunity for media that can demonstrate roi to tap into smbs future advertising plans
5730997 with the success weve had this year and how fast weve progressed im ready for the next step and this will help us get prepared for next year and getting nascars approval to run on certain tracks
5730998 um zwei wochen bis zum 19 o6 2008 stillschweigend zu verl ngern
5730999 we received thousands of entries but these photographs really stood out in each of their respective categories
5731000 in todays on the go society consumers especially photographers are looking for portable power solutions to run their high tech devices
5731001 energizer r ultimate lithium offers overall greater reliability allowing photographers and high tech users to get the maximum use out of their equipment
5731002 because people who spank are too lazy to use their brain and figure out ways to deal with behavior so instead they use their hands or other objects to hurt their child instead of actually parenting them they are so afraid that their kid will turn out badly behaved that they go to the extreme of hitting them 2 yr olds with low verbal skills hit when they are angry adults should be able to use other methods it baffles me that an adult would expect a 2 yr old to do something else besides hit when they are mad but yet that same adult would hit the child many people are ignorant to the fact that its possible to raise well behaved respectful kids without hitting them they view spanking as some magic method when its no different than any other form of punishment they all do the same thing whether a child is well behaved depends on how well you parent and if you dont parent well then your child ends up badly behaved which leads to parents thinking they need to spank when really they just need to be a better parent thats why spanking is lazy instead of changing their parenting style or other aspects of their parenting that is probably affecting the behavior of their child they instead resort to hitting their child as a means of trying to gain control and that to me is the lazy way out and for all the last resort spankers if you have reached a last resort then you really suck as a parent give me a break there is no last resort in parenting what will you do when spanking doesnt work turn the kid back in if my kid ever got so bad that i felt i was at my last resort i would feel like a terrible parent
5731003 i was pretty surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous
5731004 i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5731005 but im sure that team owner joe and j d gibbs team president will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think and were going to just keep working on our stuff
5731006 this sort of thing in manipulating horsepower is prevalent in the garage
5731007 its not unknown we had one of our truck series drivers ask us a couple of years ago why arent you doing this because we always did it with our previous manufacturer
5731008 i can understand because of the personal way a team would take the penalty that was without question directed toward them at jgr not the brand they were penalized before indy for overachievement
5731009 we dont condone it its not allowed in the rules
5731010 we have seen instances throughout the last couple of years where teams were found to be doing things in postrace inspection which were obvious attempts to affect the performance of the car during the race
5731011 to me that is a blatant attempt to affect the outcome of the event this was not an attempt to affect the outcome of the event
5731012 this was an attempt to somehow keep to themselves in my opinion without even knowing what was actually done it appears to be an attempt to keep their hands around some product of their effort and their hard work and it wasnt the right thing to do
5731013 i was present when the restrictor was created between nascar and the manufacturers for the truck and the nationwide series the restrictor cuts the horsepower by 150 horsepower from the potential of the engines and 1 000 rpm that limits the peak power for the nationwide and the truck series
5731014 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive
5731015 im sceptical about figures being quoted on the independent newspaper website
5731016 their story says 550 000 chickens are thrown away every day how statistically reliable is the report they are quoting from
5731017 400 000 votes spoilt was robert mugabe in london on thursday night
5731018 i am really happy and honored that fitz motorsports has chosen me as their driver for these races
5731019 to run in the nationwide series is a new challenge for me and also an excellent path for my career as a nascar driver
5731020 i am more than ready to take this on and i will give it everything ive got to position myself as a contender in this series
5731021 we hadden niet verwacht dat deze cr mes tumorengroei zouden stimuleren

5731528 we have made an early decision given the rain that has fallen in the last hour to abandon wednesdays card
5731529 the met office have also issued a severe weather warning for the yorkshire area for the next few hours and we deeply regret abandoning on wednesday
5731530 there will be a noon inspection on wednesday for the prospects of racing for thursday and friday and we are sitting down now with all parties to work out a race programme for those two days
5731531 its hugely disappointing for everyone its our flagship meeting and its desperately disappointing to lose two days
5731532 it had dried out nicely during the afternoon with some strong wind and sunshine and we were heading in the right direction
5731533 we were halfway around the course and got an absolute soaking the met office issued a severe weather warning as it happened and that put paid to wednesdays racing
5731534 its a very unsettled picture there are showers around and brighter spells around so if we could have a period of consistently drying conditions we would be hopeful for thursday

5731537 the hd 4870 continues to show its value time and time again and this time around is really no different the good overclock on the core along with the slight memory overclock helps performance stay up against the stock clocked offering at all times with it being able to pass the gtx 280 at some points and at others stay extremely competitive against it for a very reasonable price it would have been nice to see a game included in the bundle since asus do have a hd 4870 which comes with alone in the dark its not the end of the world though and what people really want when they buy a top card from asus is performance and this card manages to deliver the only thing that were not digging on the card is the feminine look of the cooler with its pink flowers again though this isnt a major issue since you dont see it thanks to the card facing down all the time but it was still a surprise to see the design when pulling the card out of the box overall the hd 4870 top from asus is a pretty good card it gives us a bit more performance than the stock clocked card and comes with all the cables and accessories we need to get the card up and running straight away if youre not interested in overclocking yourself and wouldnt mind a bit more performance for a few extra dollars the hd 4870 top is a good option from asus

5731565 it demands too much to ask that the structures considered in mathematics be physically possible indeed in the case of higher set theory there is every reason to believe that they are not physically possible
5731566 it is very doubtful that a generous notion of logical possibility would be distinguishable in a principled way from mathematical possibility
5731567 it is mathematically possible that there should be no sets of uncountable rank although it is a theorem of zf that there are such sets

5731577 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5731578 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed

5731582 if ive got an attorney making a thousand dollars an hour reviewing lots of e mail thats a lot of much each day our search technology is very expressive we can cull down i can search for everything from alex in march of 2006 and then further refine it to ten e mails regarding wrongful termination customers want precision i can get all of alexs e mail but i want to chop that workload down so that when i give it to outside counsel they have a few dozen e mails not a few thousand to review
5731583 lets say i just got an iphone and im really excited and i sync it up with my work e mail but i accidentally do a reverse sync and blow out my mailbox now i see only welcome to the apple iphone if i dont have mimosa then my only approach is to go to backup tapes and reapply the incrementals and if its daily backups ive lost everything i did today if its been some time since the last weekly backup it could take four hours some it guys we talk to spend 15 percent of their time doing this

5731594 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have cancelled another authors novel apparently because of concerns about possible islamic reprisals

5731599 dass es beim thema green procurement teilweise noch erheblichen nachholbedarf in vielen unternehmen gibt ist nicht nur auf deutschland begrenzt sondern berall in der industrie der fall wichtig ist vor allem dass das umdenken des einkaufs in hinblick auf die einhaltung kologischer und ethischer standards bei den unternehmen von oben dem top management erfolgt

5731601 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
5731602 he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5731603 i will let no one question my love of this country
5731604 i love america so do you and so does john mccain when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5731605 unlike barack obama john mccain doesnt have to compensate for a lack of credibility on the international stage with inflammatory and public threats against american allies
5731606 the terrorists who attacked us on 9 11 are still at large russia has invaded the sovereign nation of georgia iran is pursuing nuclear weapons the next commander in chief is going to have to exercise the best possible judgment in getting us through these difficult times
5731607 six years ago i stood up at a time when it was politically difficult to oppose going to war in iraq and argued that our first priority had to be finishing the fight against osama bin laden and al qaeda in afghanistan
5731608 sen mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks and that as despicable as saddam hussein was posed no imminent threat to the american people
5731609 sen mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues
5731610 for the good of our country i wish he had been right and i had been wrong but thats not what history shows
5731611 our military is badly overstretched a fact that has surely been noted in capitals around the world
5731612 and while we pay a heavy price in iraq and americans pay record prices at the pump iraqs government is sitting on a 79 billion dollar budget surplus from windfall oil profits
5731613 this is the central front in the war on terrorism
5731614 sen mccain argued that we could just and i quote muddle through in afghanistan and only came around to supporting my call for more troops last month
5731615 russian troops have yet to begin the withdrawal required by the cease fire signed by their president and we are hearing reports of russian atrocities burning wheat fields brutal killings and the destruction of georgias infrastructure and military assets

5731633 capcom is releasing street fighter iv in 2009 which is the 20th anniversary of the game
5731634 the action is an organic result of the conflict that our characters find themselves in
5731635 we took great care to construct our characters starting point so when we watched them grow in separate directions good and evil the fighting scenes would be out of natural conflict and make sense its very much like batman begins in that sense
5731636 im not certain how much of the game will coincide with the story because ours is a very partitioned off origin story of the street fighter universe
5731637 so the release dates will coincide elements between the two will coincide but in terms of them relating to each other perfectly i dont believe thats the case
5731638 people are like well she doesnt know the sex pistols why would i know that stuff look how young i am that stuffs old right

5731700 i think i have learned from the disappointment of not qualifying that we have to concentrate on the early stages this is another chance for me it is an opportunity to captain a winning team lets not talk about winning the world cup we just need to qualify our target has to be solely on qualifying for the world cup we have the squad to do it and we now have to show that on the pitch its in our hands to do it
5731701 it showed my character to the manager to bounce back the way i did after that huge disappointment showed what kind of person i am maybe that persuaded him
5731702 to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me and makes me very proud once again the manager called everyone together and told the squad as a whole i was a little bit shocked rio has been in awesome form for manchester united so for me to get the armband ahead of everyone in the squad is a massive achievement i had heard little whispers that rio had got it so i was shocked

5731711 ignoring or deferring patches for known vulnerabilities is not a responsible strategy nor is it reasonable for most companies to disconnect their business from the internet so managing vulnerabilities simply has to be done
5731712 its a task which is consuming far too high a percentage of limited it resources
5731713 the fact that leading vendors are calling for collaborative industry wide frameworks to address threats and vulnerabilities is strong evidence of the level of pain being expressed by their top customers in this area

5731732 saya mendengar ada informasi bahwa sudah ada penandatanganan mou antara yayasan yang diwakili swasta dengan pihak kwarnas menyangkut pengelolaan kawasan lanpera untuk tujuan komersial
5731733 kami terus terang resah apalagi yang kami dengar ada pihak swasta yang dibackingi oleh sejumlah pejabat tinggi dan anggota dpr ri ikut bermain dibalik rencana itu
5731734 anehnya ketika kita cek ke kwarnas sejumlah pengurus mengatakan bahwa kwarnas tidak mempunyai rencana menata ulang kawasan tersebut kalau tindakan ini dibiarkan kami khawatir kegiatan pramuka akan vakum bahkan sebelumnya presiden sby pernah mencanangkan bahwa kawasan itu bukan kawasan bisnis untuk itu harus dipertahankan menjadi kampus pramuka pecinta dirgantara
5731735 ketika itu mereka menyatakan bahwa cibubur aero club dibubarkan tentu saja kami kaget karena itu para pengurus dan anggota lainnya tidak setuju sebab untuk membubarkan cac harus ada pembahasan terlebih dahulu dan harus diputuskan melalui rapat anggota sesuai dengan ad art cac
5731736 setiap ada event kepramukaan kami sering memberikan pelatihan tentang kedirgantaraan kepada para anggota pramuka ada sekitar 20 anggota yang aktif menularkan ilmunya kepada anak anak bangsa agar mereka mencintai dunia kedirgantaraan nah kalau dibubarkan trus bagaimana nasib adik adik kami

5731880 the critics need a reboot the internet hasnt led us into a new dark age
5731881 even if we grant the point that on some measure todays teenagers and 20 year olds perform no worse than yesterdays the implication critics make seems like a concession to inferiority just because sophomores 50 years ago couldnt explain the monroe doctrine or identify a play by sophocles any more than todays sophomores doesnt mean that todays shouldnt do better far better

5731912 there is safety in information parents and students need to know that college campuses are doing all they can to keep students safe we must take every step possible to prevent a tragedy like the seton hall fire from ever happening again i am glad our bill is now law so we can finally give the public the information it needs to evaluate fire safety at colleges and universities
5731913 i am pleased that our work to close a dangerous public safety loophole at college campuses all over the nation has finally paid off if these common sense fire safety disclosure requirements were in place years ago lives may have been saved and perhaps fewer families and classmates would have experienced the horrific shock and pain that overwhelmed the seton hall community in 2000
5731914 college students should be thinking about their futures and not worried about losing their lives
5731915 we want to keep them safe and to avoid catastrophic tragedies like the one we experienced in new jersey it is important to arm them with all of the information we can so students and their families can make informed choices as to which colleges and universities are safest
5731916 the majority of africans today are poorer than those who lived in the stone age era
5731917 africans ought to drive their own age of enlightenment by asking such basic questions as to why a continent rich in minerals is perceived to be poorer than the rest of the world
5731918 this could be done by ensuring that all african children are educated to believe in themselves and to have confidence in african values in order to dispel the notion that anything african was inferior
5731919 european history is dotted with tribalism ethnicity superstition extreme religious beliefs repressive kingdoms and wars but that ought not to be an excuse for africans to celebrate the lesson europe offers however is that the exploitation of an inquiring mind a mind that was willing to be rebellious and give reason the power to shape peoples lives is what gave birth to europe as we know it today

5731921 i dont think there is any talk of postponement at this stage
5731922 its a concern that we havent yet had confirmation from all eight countries that they are prepared to go to pakistan
5731923 haroon lorgat the icc chief executive is in the uk currently meeting the board of ecb today he is due in south africa at the end of the week the scheduled start time for the tournament is perilously close so of course i am concerned
5731924 the icc has put us on standby and we have been having a continuous dialogue with them on this
5731925 but i dont think there is any talk of postponement at this stage and i believe the tournament is going to take place as scheduled in pakistan
5731926 we are the official alternate venue and if there is any hitch in the original venue we are ready
5731927 we do not sponsor partner much like we do with hundreds of web sites any site hosting copyrighted streaming content in this case they are not actually hosting the content we view services that dont actually host content as if they were a search engine in these instances the web publisher is not violating our terms today however obviously theres moves to be made here as an industry and as those change so will our terms
5731928 my biggest discovery is that my children bring the greatest joy to me nothing comes close
5731929 the number of times that a physician will deal with a surrogate decision maker is growing as our population ages and conditions such as alzheimers disease become more common the issue of how physicians interact with surrogates is a very important one we found that physicians often want to take an active role in determining what is right for a patient and often grapple with the needs of the patient versus those of the surrogate
5731930 i always think its important that its not a decision that the family member or the surrogate is making for themselves but it is a decision that they are making for someone else based upon their best knowledge of what that person would want
5731931 when i feel strongly that the patients quality of life is really poor then i do feel that it is appropriate for the physician to try and guide the family member toward a decision
5731932 if the patient cant make the decision then i discuss it with the family i sometimes will push the family to do what i think is best for the patient
5731933 i think family burden is an issue i dont think it should govern what the final decision is but i do think it should be addressed
5731934 post we reported that the media were taking a new interest in a mushrooming political fraud scandal involving
5731935 teachers are back in their rooms getting their rooms prepared
5731936 its nice to see it getting back to where we should be at this time of the year and its nice to know the community has been so supportive
5731937 were very pleased with how this is looking especially from july 18
5731938 theyre ready for the kids to come back and thats what were all looking forward to

5731941 the silicon would not have contributed to the fluid like qualities of the anthrax powders
5731942 it would have been easy to make these samples at
5731943 a body of powerful evidence that allows us to conclude that we have identified the origin and the perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax mailings
5731944 this is an ever evolving script that they are writing
5731945 has caused or was likely to cause serious injury or death to patients
5731946 i dont know if it will change my habits but you have to be concerned
5731947 its a changing marketplace and consumers are using the internet differently than they used to
5731948 people are starting to go directly to the website or use bookmarks if they know what theyre looking for rather than using a portal and if they dont know where to find it theyre going to use a search engine google is best positioned to take advantage of this trend while the rest are struggling to maintain relevancy
5731949 the future is about having a platform in the cloud
5731950 over the next decade you are going to see an incredible transformation in my opinion
5731951 it doesnt really make sense for most companies to have their own data centers just as it doesnt make sense for most companies to produce their own electric power
5731952 if you store a gigabyte of data for a month well send you a bill for 15 cents
5731953 to me cloud computing conjures up the image of something being very fluid and being very flexible
5731954 the benefits of the cloud are not only time to market but also pay as you go type of model
5731955 were now relying on the collective wisdom of this leadership
5731956 the outside world continues to watch developments in zimbabwe closely and with concern not least given the deteriorating humanitarian situation we will do all we can to help
5731957 finally to make fully clear to robert mugabe that a new government in zimbabwe that must reflect the will of the zimbabwean population is necessary
5731958 to help put zimbabwe on the right road to its recovery
5731959 serious blot on the culture of democracy in our subregion

5731961 woe be it for anything that stands in the way of change
5731962 the 1st amendments right to the free exercise of religion does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the antidiscrimination requirements
5731963 remain free to voice their objections religious or otherwise to the laws prohibition against sexual orientation discrimination
5731964 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women
5731965 its a win for everyone because everyone could be the next target if doctors choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people
5731966 i am not so certain this balance of competing interests would produce the same result in the case of a sole practitioner
5731967 porque no he conocido ning n argumento jur dico ni pol tico serio en contra que nos haya dicho por qu se debe prohibir que la sociedad vasca sea consultada

5731974 ecb chief executive davd collier was at the meeting and he will report back
5731975 they have a board meeting in london today to discuss the issue
5731976 the meeting lasted two hours and it was an opportunity for all the players to ask whatever questions they had about the tournament
5731977 david collier and hugh morris managing director of the england team were both there and they heard the views of all the players
5731978 skipper kevin pietersen said last night he was pleased englands players had had the chance to put forward their views and said he believed the ecb
5731979 there is a lot more happening particularly in communities around the gvrd
5731980 thats in large part to do with the fact that the communities are growing and as they grow the citizens want arts and cultural things closer to home they dont want to be coming back downtown all the time
5731981 langley has just tripled and quadrupled in size in the last few years
5731982 weve been here 14 years ourselves and weve seen a tremendous change where there used to be a lot of acreage its all under development to single family dwellings and multiple home dwelling with that they bring business their kids go to school there are other ethnicities and its just humming
5731983 i think one of the biggest pieces to us is the sense of ownership that this community has of it
5731984 its a relatively small community populationwise and its very very well supported we have 120 volunteers giving over 2 000 hours total
5731985 a lot of the smaller communities have been suffering economically
5731986 a lot of communities feel that they need to develop arts and cultural amenities not just to attract a creative workforce but to retain the one they have already
5731987 they need to get their house in order or they risk alienating all these new customers theyve added over the last few years the new buyers arent apple fanatics and wont sit quietly as they try to access broken services via failing hardware
5731988 we are always talking about investing in the town and we want to invest in people who can make a difference
5731989 i dont feel we have the money in the budget and i never did feel that we had the money in the budget
5731990 if we did have that kind of money we could add another 10 20 projects
5731991 when my mum had gone we needed money to buy electricity dog food stuff like that really
5731992 it wasnt like i was doing it for the glitz and glamour for the big watch the big chain trying to be like rapper 50 cent it was because i needed that to live
5731993 i wished that i didnt have to do it that i didnt have to go through the stress the aggro the looking over my back every two minutes
5731994 i would have rather have stuck in school or gone to college or just have got help from somewhere really
5731995 all drug data understates the level of drug dealing it must do because it is a very hard offence to police
5731996 sometimes theyre referred to as run arounds which means they do errands they deliver things theyll take messages and sometimes some of the things theyll deliver is drugs
5731997 10 books that screwed up the world and 5 others that didnt help
5731998 regional african bodies have tremendous influence there are so many things that could be brought to bear that could have a tremendous immediate impact on zimbabwe
5731999 only god can remove him from office and that hell wage war to stay put
5732000 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
5732001 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it
5732002 the fact is most people are simply unaware of the full functionality of the product
5732003 by being first to market by having a high quality product and by providing high levels of service i think you can build a brand and establish yourself as a premier resource
5732004 within a corporation people are using google every day whether it is sales marketing research and development human resources and recruiting
5732005 the product is ubiquitous in its business use and yet people are not taking advantage of the functionality
5732006 we think the google piece of it is an overlooked piece
5732007 people just take for granted that everybody googles and nobody stops and thinks twice about the inefficiency in the process
5732008 theres not a liberal america and a conservative america there is the united states of america theres not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian america there is the united states of america
5732009 all my life i had carried a single image of my father one that i had sometimes rebelled against but had never questioned one that i had later tried to take as my own the brilliant scholar the generous friend the upstanding leader my father had been all those things
5732010 all those things and more because except for that one brief visit in hawaii he had never been present to foil the image because i hadnt seen what perhaps most men see at some point in their lives their fathers body shrinking their fathers best hopes dashed their fathers face lined with grief and regret
5732011 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country

5732055 from available statistics 100 000 infants die from in nigeria annually making it the number one sickle cell endemic country in africa
5732056 nigeria accounts for 75 percent of infant sickle cell cases in africa and almost 80 percent of infant deaths from the disease in the continent
5732057 the mutant sickle cell gene confers a survival advantage against malaria which explains the prevalence of the disease in nigeria where malaria is endemic
5732058 with one out of every five africans being a nigerian and this countrys high rate of malarial transmission it is obvious nigeria stands at a disadvantage as far as sickle cell is concerned

5732122 we have to ensure theres a platform for these players to show their wares to fabio at senior level said pearce
5732123 its a doubled edged sword if you like they need to perform here for me and we need to drive this team forward but its also important that we can come away from any given game and individually the players have nudged fabios arm if you like and he thinks they are good enough for his squad
5732124 its a very strong squad on paper and now we need to deliver a performance which indicates that strength
5732125 right across the board we have a strong squad and lot of players with experience of playing regularly in the premier league with their clubs
5732126 there is good team spirit and there are a lot of faces here who are familiar to this squad on top of that we have some new ones as well but you can go through the squad and there are not too many names that people might think where is he playing his club football
5732127 we have sold out the last few under 21 games and there are not too many countries at this level that bring the crowds in and im including the likes of italy and germany i think that is probably a testament to the quality of players on show
5732128 i think some of the players in the under 21 squad should be disappointed if they dont make the senior squad
5732129 but as soon as the squad is picked and if youre in the under 21 side you should be ready to roll your sleeves up and think i must do well in this squad
5732130 it is important that players view international football whether it be for the under 21 side or the seniors as an education it is an opportunity to play in a different style and be alongside the best talent in the country
5732131 there are five of six boys who arguably could be in the senior squad but for them to sit on the bench against the czech republic for the senior squad is probably a bit counter productive
5732132 they need to be playing football at their age and if they are eligible for the under 21 category they should be here theyll get experience from being on the pitch not in the stands
5732133 i would definitely describe it as a dream start because we couldnt have asked for anything better than a win
5732134 were not getting carried away and we know that there is a lot of hard work to be done obviously were pleased to get three points from our first ever home game in the premier league but there are a lot of hard games to come
5732135 but there are plenty of experienced players in the squad like ian ashbee dean windass and nick barmby theyll help to make sure everybody stays level headed
5732136 the players were all eager to get started and once we were all in the dressing room we seemed to switch straight back into the same mode as last season folan added
5732137 it just seemed like wed never been away because everything was like normal we did ourselves justice
5732138 we showed a lot of character to come back from a goal down i thought we showed why we did so well last season
5732139 the spirit of the club was there for everybody to see and the fitness levels in the second half were incredible before the game we said that fulham didnt travel well last season and we tried to exploit their weaknesses
5732140 not to be used with x box or any gaming system
5732141 we only have five this time and usually its eight or nine five withdrawals isnt bad george is pretty pleased with that
5732142 it is disappointing because its the early part of the season and you would look to have all your players available when preparing for a world cup qualifier all of them have genuine injuries and are struggling to play and the doctors have had a look at them
5732143 george has probably gone though teams in his head that he would like to have played so it is frustrating
5732144 theres no doubt i would like to go to another major tournament i havent been for a few years and that appeals to anyone
5732145 the disappointments of the last few years are in the back of my head and i would love to go to another world cup i was fortunate enough to go in 2002 so that enticed me to come back and when i met the manager i felt it was right

5732254 the city of new orleans wants to maximize the federal assistance funds they receive and ensure they continue to be appropriately represented in congress
5732255 in order to do this it is important to accurately track repopulation and valassis is at the heart of this success

5732274 we invited the michigan legislature to take part in legislative build 2008 and 117 signed up
5732275 our goal is to expose legislators to organizations striving on a local level to provide affordable housing and community improvements while encouraging economic development
5732276 legislative build 2008 is a bi partisan effort with both sides of the aisle working side by side
5732277 this project truly celebrates partnerships both across the aisle and among the many organizations and individuals
5732278 this project is not just a learning experience its a chance to get in touch with the many volunteer opportunities that exist helping local communities and michigan families
5732279 thats why the legislative build involves all of us democrats republicans senate and house members by participating in our home districts we can be part of a true statewide effort to provide housing and spur economic development
5732280 in order to attract jobs michigan needs vibrant neighborhoods and downtowns
5732281 this is a way for legislators to see the good work being done by community groups right in their own districts and the economic impact its having on the local communities
5732282 the model weve developed here and in pittsfield is working well in the big cities and theres no reason it cant work here
5732283 there is still a lot of interest in that and mr carver continues to expand his product
5732284 you have to have a strong housing component but with that has to be also the cultural attractions which continue to expand and grow in the downtown area so all those things are starting to come together those are all positive signs in a down economy
5732285 the facades of these building are absolutely exceptional and theyre structurally sound which makes them worthy of renovation
5732286 we had no idea whether it would work or not
5732287 we decided to try a small piece of it and see what happens when you do a piece at a time if it doesnt work youre still alive to fight another battle
5732288 a very radical makeover we had to take the plunge and take a risk
5732289 we have 14 apartments i kept one and sold 13 in a matter of two or three months maybe three years ago
5732290 we bought the building for a song in 98 or something and we did a whole remodeling after about six years lifestyles changed and we figured a good exit strategy was to sell them as condos
5732291 some people live there some people have them for occasional use some people use it for their family some people rent it out they really were quite inexpensive in the 30 000 to the low 40 000 range
5732292 are very special customers and they are out there they wanted to buy into a downtown that is in the very early stages of this process
5732293 we like the fact that the museums are nearby we like the way the library has been redone and of course we like the whole berkshire area
5732294 it is much more in use by the family than we expected
5732295 its a small unit but it fits eight or 10 of us pretty comfortably its very nice
5732296 we like it for so many reasons like the location
5732297 we like to be in the center of town where we can walk to many places and they did an excellent job of redoing the apartments they used creative imagination its very attractive
5732298 we failed to realize that the urban anchors now are cultural attractions and housing retailers are not the pioneers they are the followers
5732299 now it takes half the people to do twice as much of the work
5732300 we thought that to have a vibrant downtown we needed a mix of income levels to have an affect on the downtown office and retail market
5732301 well wait and let the market steer us the right way
5732302 thats the plan i dont know if it will work or how long it will take well just take it one day at a time i guess
5732303 these grants are quite literally a lifeline for those struggling to find a decent home while trying to manage complex drug therapies
5732304 working closely with our local partners we can offer these families the support they need to concentrate on staying healthy instead of worrying how theyll pay next months rent
5732305 thats extraordinary and wonderful and when youre part of that you think ah this is maybe why i went into the movies in the beginning i thought it would be full of wonderful people
5732306 weve got a movie full of wonderful people who did extraordinary things to help

5732313 there were rumours of strictly come dancing and all sorts but nothing that great has actually been offered to sharon its not often she admits she is wrong but shes worried she has misjudged her popularity
5732314 this is a big challenge for us a lot of people have tried and failed
5732315 i think the expectation in the community is that until we have the higher end destination retail there isnt any reason to shop downtown so we have to do it
5732316 saks fifth avenues departure would make the opportunity to attract similar retailers even less compelling
5732317 indeed one has to wonder whether the ubiquitous brands already in the golden triangle talbots ann taylor joseph a bank clothiers and bailey banks amp biddle would remain if the upscale anchor were to leave
5732318 if we can work to put something together with a property owner and a retailer and take it to them we think they would be receptive to that
5732319 cranes are dotting pittsburghs skyline downtown living is on the rise and in historic market square business is booming we must build upon this momentum working together to improve pittsburghs retail environment

5732440 dance shows always do well but it has to be adapted for trends working on tv
5732441 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
5732442 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
5732443 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
5732444 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
5732445 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
5732446 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
5732447 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
5732448 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and choreographed dances for weddings dance is on the brain
5732449 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
5732450 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
5732451 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
5732452 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new
5732453 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5732454 i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5732455 ive got nothing for you on the vp sweepstakes anything in that regard ought to be directed to the mccain campaign
5732456 i dont talk about the vp stuff because i think its mostly speculation and i just have stopped talking about it
5732457 you want appreciation even though you like whats happening now doesnt mean that you still dont want appreciation or greater stimulation it just means youre not using something in your now as your excuse to not let in all those things that youve been wanting the perfect creative stance is satisfaction where i am and eagerness for more

5732487 the expectation surrounding the club is something we are going to have to cope with
5732488 bellars being injured will give me more of a chance of maybe a start
5732489 thats a good thing from me but hopefully craig will be back soon to strengthen the squad
5732490 it was nice to get out on the pitch in the first game of the season and get a little run out and obviously for the team it was great to get the three points
5732491 weve been waiting for it for so long so it is good to get off the mark

5732494 i am very much looking forward to valencia as i am a big fan of street circuits in general
5732495 when you make a mistake you easily run into barriers though valencia will not be a complete street circuit there will be lots of run off areas for safety reasons
5732496 the lap time improvement has to be gained step by step you cannot drive in too wild a style you must also approach the ideal racing line gradually
5732497 everyone dreams about winning but you never think its a reality
5732498 im just so proud of myself i crossed the line and just thought oh my goodness
5732499 its hard but my coach has always taught me you have to go in to each race expecting to win
5732500 hopefully i will come through okay and will be fit to be involved in the squad
5732501 the pre season went well and i played decently i am not saying i would have been in the team but i wanted to play a part in the first few matches
5732502 when you are experienced you get an inkling of how the manager views his starting line up and i am sure he largely knew his team but it is a squad game and you never know what might happen
5732503 branislav chose milan and he told that to the club and for that reason he will probably wear the rossoneri shirt this next season
5732504 the deal will be done because no one will keep an unhappy player
5732505 i would never blame individuals for the team not lifting a trophy we are in it together we win as a team and we lose as a team
5732506 as individuals we all make mistakes and the message i was relaying to a czech newspaper was that we are more experienced now and have learnt from last season

5732511 i made it i finally won a gold medal i cant stop smiling im so excited
5732512 but i go by everything happens for a reason and for some reason the judges were giving me scores im not used to but they had a reason
5732513 it did upset me a little but i thought about it and i decided i was at the olympic games i was having the time of my life and im winning medals
5732514 when you do get silver you feel different emotions but i looked back and appreciated that i had a medal
5732515 if it were gold it might feel differently i dont know how to explain it i definitely came to appreciate it i wouldnt trade my silver medals for anything in the world not even gold
5732516 the more mistakes you make in practice the more you worry
5732517 i wanted to do my best routine i didnt want to leave the olympics thinking i could do better
5732518 we have made an early decision given the rain that has fallen in the last hour to abandon wednesdays card
5732519 the met office have also issued a severe weather warning for the yorkshire area for the next few hours and we deeply regret abandoning on wednesday
5732520 there will be a noon inspection on wednesday for the prospects of racing for thursday and friday and we are sitting down now with all parties to work out a race programme for those two days
5732521 its hugely disappointing for everyone its our flagship meeting and its desperately disappointing to lose two days
5732522 it had dried out nicely during the afternoon with some strong wind and sunshine and we were heading in the right direction
5732523 we were halfway around the course and got an absolute soaking the met office issued a severe weather warning as it happened and that put paid to wednesdays racing
5732524 its a very unsettled picture there are showers around and brighter spells around so if we could have a period of consistently drying conditions we would be hopeful for thursday

5732532 why did i not know about this am i that na ve or is it the fact that the problem itself is not well publicised for whatever reason
5732533 why has madeleine received such attention when there are thousands of missing children around the world
5732534 every child matters everywhere we all agree with that yet there are people out there who will prey on children and young people who will look to exploit them for personal pleasure and who will distribute and publish images for their own illegal gain

5732544 we needed competition at centre half and andy is a rabbit out of the hat thats for sure to get somebody of andys experience given the amount of games he played for hearts and internationally for scotland is fantastic
5732545 he has seen our rising status and it is a move that works for all parties he needs games and we feel he is fit enough
5732546 every signing you make has an element of risk but that is what the medical is all about
5732547 andy came through that fine and we made sure that he is strong in the areas he has had operations on
5732548 he had a hernia and a knee operation similar to the one steve brooker had and has worked hard to get himself back over the last 12 months
5732549 he saw this picture and obviously for him it was very easy to recognise the girl accompanied by a woman in a veil
5732550 its her nanny she is a young moroccan woman who is qualified to look after children and works in a care centre
5732551 i am very pleased that this little girl has been identified and that she can be ruled out from her familys perspective
5732552 clearly for kate and gerry it is a disappointment but we have had many of these before and the search for madeleine will continue
5732553 with this big media attention people are stimulated and are looking with more attention on the subway and on airplanes
5732554 kate and gerry hoped from the outset that police were following up every lead in the most thorough and professional manner possible
5732555 where any information is found to not have been followed up our private investigators are working on it all of it
5732556 she left by the main entrance and in a dark area with movement sensitive lights she noticed something moving and thought it was a rat
5732557 she was shocked when r examination she saw it was the brown shoe of a man who was peeping in the dark area outside the apartment
5732558 she shouted and the man came out of the darkness activating the lights he walked towards her and said no no
5732559 the director of m3 metodo 3 handed us a small notepad with information relating to madeleines disappearance
5732560 they said the information had come from their spanish madeleine helpline
5732561 we notice that it reports facts which took place in august sept of 2006 which seems to us outdated and of no relation to the material under investigation
5732562 kate and gerry would also like to thank this girls parents for going to police
5732563 it is disappointing news but they have been in this position before and the hunt for madeleine will continue every sighting raises awareness which is a good thing when it is in peoples minds they are looking out for her which is what we need
5732564 knowing this we strongly believe madeleine is out there and can be found
5732565 now that the authorities are no longer looking for madeleine we implore everyone who has provided information to contact us
5732566 we will guarantee that all information will be treated in the strictest confidence
5732567 our investigators continue to explore credible leads and will continue to do so as long as madeleine is missing
5732568 i would bet everything i own that it was her
5732569 each time i had the impression i knew her face if i had recognised her as madeleine i would have looked for the speck in her eye it was only later that i saw her face and recognised that it was her
5732570 we are looking for the woman in the video we have taken all sightings seriously
5732571 she held her hand firmly and kept pulling her closer
5732572 when i gave the ice cream to the child she stood frozen
5732573 normally a happy child always takes the ice this was not a normal situation
5732574 the lady had a headscarf and the blonde girl i guess was five
5732575 she had her eyes towards the floor and was too shy to look up
5732576 the lady asked her in a mixture of french and english what she wanted
5732577 she did seem to have some kind of spot in her eye like a comma
5732578 i had not seen the pictures of madeleine with a spot in her eye at that time i found them a very strange couple
5732579 im definitely inspired by his story and what he overcame because me and him have similar paths
5732580 being mediocre is a million times better than my best high
5732581 i love what i do i love waking up every day going out to the field knowing that im doing the thing i love to do and getting paid for it thats something ive never felt before when i was 18 and i signed that contract i had too big of a head and i didnt understand anything
5732582 i didnt understand life and what it was made of what it was going to bring to the table for me
5732583 i mean he was a first round pick we thought about him like you would with any first round pick
5732584 i love what i do i love waking up every day going out to the field knowing that im doing the thing i love to do and getting paid for it
5732585 in 05 i went four months sober maybe three if that
5732586 forget about wakeup calls because you can overdose you can have seizures you can do all these things physically that can bring you down
5732587 but until you figure it out for your own and reach out to the people that tried to reach out to you in the beginning thats when youre really going to figure it out
5732588 thats when youre really going to choose life over death and thats what i did
5732589 hes 23 years old now and his maturity level is a lot higher than it was when he was 20 years old
5732590 i just want to see jeff pitch every five days
5732591 whatever happens happens but i just want to give him the ball every five days
5732592 i admire the heck out of him i love him i think hes a super person
5732593 if something happens bad in the game or in his personal life what do you think he starts thinking about
5732594 first of all im happy he has his life together and hes focused on something and being productive as far as expectations i didnt expect all of his stuff to come back especially since hes been out of the game for so long but hes shown what he can do
5732595 thats what i wanted to do i wanted to be a normal human being
5732596 and for me to do that i had to do certain things to get back to normal life and i did those things and i became a man
5732597 i knew that i had to become a man quick

5732751 this is all to protect poor muslims from rich christians who buy their organs and vice versa
5732752 if some copts are angered by the law then why is it that muslims are not
5732753 it is degrading for both religions if lets say a poor christian has to sell his kidney to a rich muslim or a poor muslim has to sell his kidney to a rich christian it is not right for either religion and that is why we made this law so we can stop organ trafficking
5732754 it is not about trying to promote differences between religions but its just to minimize the trade of organs as much as we can
5732755 we all have the same egyptian blood but if the reason for the measure is to end organ trafficking we reject it because it may also occur between believers of the same religion
5732756 we are afraid that in the future there will be hospitals for christians and hospitals for muslims

5732759 if organ donations are from the third or fourth degree of the family then there is less of a chance of a trade happening as its not likely that family members will sell organs to each other
5732760 no one really comes up and says they want to donate their organs to other people who are not in their family this happens in the west but in egypt it is mostly the poor people who are desperate and end up selling their organs for money

5732797 i want atheism to be true it isnt just that i dont believe in god and naturally hope that im right in my belief its that i hope there is no god i dont want there to be a god i dont want the universe to be like that i am curious whether there is anyone who is genuinely indifferent as to whether there is a god anyone who whatever his actual belief about the batter doesnt particularly want ether one of the answers to be correct
5732798 if you dont trust the bible enough to let it challenge and correct your thinking how could you ever have a personal relationship with god in any truly personal relationship the other person has to be able to contradict you if a wife is not allowed to contradict her husband they wont have an intimate relationship now what happens if you eliminate anything from the bible that offends your sensibility and crosses your will if you pick and choose what you want to believe and reject the rest how will you ever have a god who can contradict you you wont youll have a stepford god a god essentially of your own making and not a god with whom you can have a relationship and genuine interaction only if your god can say things that outrage you and make you struggle as in a real friendship or marriage will you know that you have gotten hold of a real god and not a figment of your imagination so an authoritative bible is not the enemy of a personal relationship with god it is the precondition for it

5732868 upward growth biases built into gdp modeling since the early 1980s have rendered this important series nearly worthless

5732870 if you were to peel back changes that were made in the cpi going back to the carter years youd see that the cpi would now be 3
5732871 can be directly traced back to the 1983 bls decision to exclude the price of housing from the cpi with the illusion of low inflation inducing lenders to offer 6 percent loans not only has speculation run rampant on the expectations of ever rising home prices but home buyers by the millions have been tricked into buying homes even though they only qualified for the teaser rates
5732872 confidence can be learned two ways through real trading experiences and the proper use of visualization techniques
5732873 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
5732874 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
5732875 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
5732876 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
5732877 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
5732878 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
5732879 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
5732880 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
5732881 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
5732882 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
5732883 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
5732884 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
5732885 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
5732886 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
5732887 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
5732888 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people
5732889 be the change that you want to see in the world
5732890 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
5732891 as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convene at whatever level
5732892 email archiving is clearly proving its worth and we are delighted to see its uptake so pervasive and successful and especially that only 1 of the people we surveyed reported any negative experiences or attitudes towards email compliance however while the lack of appreciation of its utility is concerning what is perhaps more alarming is the relatively widespread assumption that email archiving is not important or necessary to the business
5732893 wherever email is the principal form of communication within the business email archiving is essential too many businesses fail to realise that each email communication sent or received is probably the only record they have of important transactions with a customer or between members of staff according to osterman research email contains nearly 75 of the information that individuals use on a daily basis making the sheer amount of corporate knowledge stored in email enough to justify its safekeeping over long periods of time
5732894 email archiving is a function that should run through all company departments obviously storage backups problematic and corrupt pst files overloaded email servers and performance are the it departments major concerns while the legal team sees email as an essential factor in its discovery disclosure and due diligence strategies indeed most of our respondents who have implemented email archiving are doing so for compliance or for ensuring they have a full paper trail should there be any form of investigation and of course email archives boost overall productivity for employees company wide when the need arises to access their email from anywhere in the world with such a high proportion of companies already seeing the benefits of email archiving educating the remainder of the necessity and advantages of the process is essential

5732902 an attack against this memorial is clearly directed against homosexuals that can be said without waiting for further police investigations

5732904 sex and the citys film whore award reveals some gender bias though maybe less than expected of the total number of men who voted for any of this categorys five films 50 percent voted for sex and the city a percentage only slightly higher than all the demographic votes for this award in fact from a gender age or profession perspective sex and the city received a high but demographically equal 45 percent to 50 percent of the vote

5732915 es ist ein traum wahr geworden nach athen hatte ich mir das so fest vorgenommen
5732916 a decision was made for the war to start in august the war would have happened regardless of what the georgians did whether they responded to the provocations or not there would have been an invasion of georgia
5732917 the goal was to destroy georgias central government defeat the georgian army and prevent georgia from joining nato
5732918 it is difficult to imagine that russia prepared such a provocation while neither of the countrys two leaders was in moscow
5732919 it is also difficult to imagine that russia prepared to go to war and then when saakashvili fell into the trap waited 13 or 14 hours by my count before deploying forces
5732920 russias policies over the past several years caused this war and for this they bear responsibility

5732931 theo is not yet completely there collectively but he can make decisions in big games that will always be his strength

5732938 the impact of foreign investment is being considered more and more by governments around the world
5732939 this has had an impact on omers in the past in one specific case related to our bid on a toll road in france
5732940 while our bid was competitive on price we lost the bid as a result of our not having a french partner
5732941 one of the reasons we are establishing omers worldwide is to grow our on the ground relationships with local partners across the globe to support our investment areas to bring successful deals to the table
5732942 this election year represents one of the most significant in political history making it even more important for the recording academy and the grammy foundation to bring an increased awareness of music issues to the policy makers from both parties at the democratic and republican national conventions
5732943 with grammys rock the conventions we hope to educate party leaders about the critical role of music and arts education regardless of ones political views its clear that when children have music in their lives we all win
5732944 i hate to say this after losing three games straight but when we are in sync and all nine guys are playing well i think we can be as strong as bolton
5732945 we have too many guys who hang their heads when they get behind in the pitching count instead of showing they are interested they pull back and shake their heads and give that sad little walk around the plate
5732946 that shouldnt happen at this level of baseball either you are going to play it as a man or maybe you shouldnt play it baseball
5732947 overall i think the team was a lot better this season than it was in 2007 the record shows that as for the playoffs what killed us was one bad inning in every game
5732948 we have four or five guys who are potentially really good pitchers they still have trouble finding the strike zone and thats something that hurt us in our last game with bolton
5732949 we have the potential but we have a couple of guys on this team who think they should be swinging hard all the time baseball isnt a game for swinging hard unless you are a very consistent home run hitter
5732950 but i will definitely not put up with the long faces i put up with this year we were l1 5 this year and we werent 11 5 because we were lucky

5732957 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect

5733160 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
5733161 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die
5733162 daughter cell gene expression is special and now we know why
5733163 akademiker haben eine gr ere auswahl m glicher arbeitsstellen und k nnen auch in angestelltenverh ltnissen teilweise sehr hohe geh lter erzielen sie w hlen daher offenbar seltener den weg in die selbstst ndigkeit
5733164 am gr ten war der wohlstand bei selbstst ndigen mit mitarbeitern es folgten angestellte selbstst ndige ohne mitarbeiter und schlie lich gelegenheitsarbeiter

5733168 our recent studies into what occurs during the chemical reaction caused by tamls proves that the catalysts are indeed really close mimics of peroxidase enzymes
5733169 by knowing the mechanics of the reactions we can fine tune the catalysts for even better performance
5733170 everyone figured that the acaricides anti varroa mite chemicals would be present in the wax because the wax is reprocessed to form the structure of the hives
5733171 it was a bit of a shock to see the levels and the widespread presence of these pesticides
5733172 we already had in place ways to test for viruses bacteria and fungi but it was difficult to find an analytical laboratory that could analyze for unknown pesticides
5733173 we needed them to take a comprehensive look at all pesticides not just those associated with beekeeping
5733174 when we began doing this work honey was not regularly analyzed and bee pollen was not a commodity and so was not analyzed
5733175 we decided to go with the types of screening the lab does for milk and apples which look at over 170 pesticides now honey is included in the commodities to be analyzed
5733176 simplicity was important because there were many people across the country sampling for us
5733177 now rather than having them collect 15 grams of pollen they need only collect 3 grams
5733178 gamma radiation is often used to kill viruses and other disease causing agents
5733179 we are finding fungicides that function by inhibiting the steroid metabolism in the fungal diseases they target but these chemicals also affect similar enzymes in other organisms
5733180 these fungicides in combination with pyrethroids and or neonicotinoids can sometimes have a synergistic effect 100s of times more toxic than any of the pesticides individually
5733181 we do not know that these chemicals have anything to do with colony collapse disorder but they are definitely stressors in the home and in the food sources
5733182 pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of ccd we believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors possibly including mites viruses and pesticides
5733183 we now want to look at small versus large operations and organic versus nonorganic operations to see if there are differences
5733184 am meeresboden finden wir gebirge die hnlich hoch sind wie die alpen
5733185 diese sind teilweise von sedimenten berlagert so dass wir unter die oberfl che schauen m ssen um hinweise auf die geologische entstehungsgeschichte des mendelejew r ckens zu finden
5733186 our previous studies showed that soft landing can be used to prepare ultrapure peptide layers on substrates the question we faced was in addition to controlling purity can we also control the structure of the molecules we showed we could
5733187 because we were starting from something that wasnt helical in solution we were a little pessimistic whether it would work at all
5733188 we found an interesting pathway to conduct different types of chemical reactions between complex molecules and substrates that will potentially enable us to prepare materials that cannot be made by standard methods
5733189 we hope to conduct lots of chemistry on the thin films
5733190 this is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere
5733191 ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards what we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in san diego and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulfur rich particles called primary sulfate would be so high
5733192 the importance of primary sulfate is usually ignored in assessments of the impact of ship emissions on air quality because less than 7 percent of all sulfur emitted by ships is found in primary sulfate particles
5733193 but our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future knowing how much sulfate from ships is in the air will also allow us to better understand what happens to the other 93 percent of sulfur emitted by ships
5733194 we found that in san diego the port of los angeles can be a significant influence on air quality because these fine particulates can travel so far
5733195 this will tell us whether californias new regulation requiring cleaner burning fuel 24 miles off the coast is having the effect its intended to have
5733196 and because a large part of the worlds population live in major cities with shipping ports such as new york city san francisco hong kong houston and singapore and global shipping is expected to increase in the decades to come this should help policy makers around the world make more informed decisions about improving the health of their citizens

5733212 the fact that online ad spending is not immune to economic downturns and yet will grow more than any other major medium might be the clearest signal yet of how mainstream the internet truly is
5733213 its really good news for brand marketers because there are really strong efficiencies they can find in search marketing t he price for this branding value is zero because its being served anyway and marketers pay for clicks not number of impressions

5733229 code pink at a mock war crimes tribunal in istanbul june 27 signed a declaration that the iraqi insurgency deserved the support of people everywhere who care for justice and freedom
5733230 we must begin by really standing with the iraqi people and defending their right to resist i can remain myself against all forms of violence and yet i cannot judge what someone has to do when pushed to the wall to protect all they love the iraqi people are fighting for their country to protect their families and to preserve all they love they are fighting for their lives and we are fighting for lies
5733231 sure why do we have bases in the middle east we totally violated the rights of that country why do we get to have bases in the middle east
5733232 barack obama has said he knows he needs to earn the trust of the military when he speaks before the veterans of foreign wars today he could take a giant step toward earning that trust by renouncing jodie evans and her bundled campaign dollars and denounce her support of the iraq insurgency
5733233 the rnc is to be commended for speaking out against evans we hope that they too will join the call for obama to renounce jodie evans

5733237 we have been more focused on this project than any weve done in years
5733238 yes it has taken a long time but in the end the fans will have a dokken cd that is as good as any we did in the 80s our goal is to deliver a cd that will shake up the rock world and so far everyone says it is the best dokken cd since 86 its time that a band from our era did something special and prove that our brand of music is still valid and i think were close if it does not have success it wont be because we didnt give it a thousand percent effort
5733239 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
5733240 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
5733241 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
5733242 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
5733243 the first thing i noticed was the really jerky scrolling in applications like looking at photos and e mail lists anything that had long lists didnt like to scroll but on the previous firmware it was very very fast
5733244 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
5733245 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
5733246 this is almost like a soap opera theres so much negative press and blogging this these firmware update issues are another problem apple doesnt need at amp t as a seller of this doesnt need from a pr standpoint
5733247 do you know who you are f with we are the police

5733251 hes the one that had to figure this all out

5733254 apple employees lounging eating smoking littering in effect trespassing on nearby peoples stoops
5733255 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5733256 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5733257 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5733258 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5733259 today many owners are not making full use of their smart phones features
5733260 concern over usage costs is still a big barrier though wider availability of flat rate data plans will help and usability still needs to improve for certain applications on many devices people are also wary of draining their battery and not being able to make calls battery life isnt helped by having gps and wi fi turned on nor by having a large bright screen for navigation or web browsing but there is clear demand for those features and applications and advances in battery technology would enable quite substantial changes in usage patterns with all the service revenue benefits that would bring
5733261 somebody buzzed the story and somebody else did as well it ended up at the yahoo front page which leads to around 300 000 clicks per second thats a crap load of users
5733262 it was a barbaric act despite all the facilities we offered to this force which didnt respect the law
5733263 weve made a conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work
5733264 condoms are actually health products and if you have a condom and you use it you are seen to be smart and responsible
5733265 its a way to show you are a condom user and you dont have any issues with it

5733278 in 1999 the other team had to lose the game because we cant win it thats a terrible thing for a manager to be saying that was the aura surrounding that team
5733279 tiger williams ive covered the super bowl nba finals and stanley cup finals ive had former bears lineman stan thomas act like he was going to squeeze my head like a zit ive interviewed roger clemens hank aaron and donald trump ive been cursed at by mike keenan ive watched denis savard go into the hockey hall of fame ive been yelled at by bill wirtz i talked sports with ben affleck at the world series of poker and i cry almost every time i see jim craig skate up the ice looking for his dad in the stands as the 1980 u
5733280 ive gotten stronger and faster ive gone up in several of my lifts and i feel a lot better ive dedicated myself to being the best that i can be for the upcoming season
5733281 were working hard im just so glad i can hit someone i cant wait to hit someone from another team i cant wait for the season
5733282 oklahoma state is recruiting me the hardest i speak with their coaches every week they also send me a lot of mail kentucky is right behind them they are sending me a lot of mail too i feel very comfortable with all of the teams that have offered me i feel comfortable with all of the coaches
5733283 im working on setting one up with oklahoma state i need to look at my schedule and were in the process of doing that i dont have a date yet but im going to visit there im also interested in visiting michigan south florida central florida and louisville
5733284 i have a top seven i like michigan oklahoma state south florida central florida louisville kentucky and clemson i will probably wait until after the season to make a decision
5733285 yes im only being recruited to play lb and i like that i like to hit people and i love defense
5733286 i need to work on being more patient and letting the play develop i think my strengths on the field are strength speed and vision
5733287 he van impe gets points for being wrong so often and still keeping his core audience
5733288 thinking beyond the contemporary mantra of democracy elections and decentralization
5733289 a tension at the international level between promoting poverty reduction and promoting competitive multi party democracy
5733290 in many cases democracies produce governments which are very effective in reducing poverty witness recent experience in brazil for example
5733291 there are less democratic regimes which have been and are very effective in reducing poverty and the international community needs to recognise that part of this effectiveness may be due to the nature of the regime where a strong connection between regime and citizens has been forged through a popular movement which generates a social compact between elite and the poor as part of a national development project
5733292 china and vietnam would also be examples and there are others during the last 60 years the implication for the international community would be to exercise caution in attaching political conditionalities to aid or other international negotiations of course this does not mean that in extreme cases eg zimbabwe the international community should not take a strong political position
5733293 we need to talk about this especially after traumatic events autocracies may do nation building more effectively than elected governments there is more to politics than ballot counting
5733294 shoring up fragile states should be as important to donors as tackling climate change
5733295 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same

5733307 while stocks in this group tend to move with oil prices in the near term their pro ts depend more on exploration spending than on commodity prices
5733308 concerns about slowing demand for crude oil and re ned products both in the u s and overseas have many investors worried but investors in the equipment and services group should not panic
5733309 most producers continue to spend aggressively and u s crude oil inventories remain well below the average for this time of year with fewer than 20 days of supply in storage
5733310 demand for offshore drilling services remains strong giving transocean excellent growth potential consensus estimates project per share pro ts will rise 69 in 2008 and 15 in 2009 transocean the world s largest offshore drilling contractor operates in every major drilling region
5733311 a combination of tight global rig supplies and the ongoing discovery of new offshore reserves have driven rig lease rates higher and kept transocean s eet busy the company s largest most expensive rigs are 95 sold out for 2009 and the backlog is growing
5733312 oceaneering international has fallen 28 since the end of june re ecting a drop in petroleum prices and somewhat disappointing guidance for the second half of 2008 the pullback represents a buying opportunity as the stock seems cheap considering oceaneering s pro t outlook
5733313 oceaneering makes its money by selling equipment and providing services to drillers a business that should remain lucrative as long as drilling demand remains strong exploration activity is likely to remain robust even if per barrel oil prices fall to the 80 to 100 range
5733314 given the large number of offshore wells now being drilled 300 plus in 2008 with even more to come demand for oceaneering s products should pick up

5733323 unfortunately each week brings a new wave of threats and vulnerabilities to be managed
5733324 ignoring or deferring patches for known vulnerabilities is not a responsible strategy nor is it reasonable for most companies to disconnect their business from the internet so managing vulnerabilities simply has to be done
5733325 its a task which is consuming far too high a percentage of limited it resources
5733326 the fact that leading vendors are calling for collaborative industry wide frameworks to address threats and vulnerabilities is strong evidence of the level of pain being expressed by their top customers in this area

5733346 i had little to go on except my gut level sense that something was desperately wrong with the way christianity was perceived in our nation my sense was that if christians could read the mind of outsiders filtered through the objective lens of research it would provide the motivation we needed to change how we see ourselves and our role in culture and over time it could significantly alter how we live and interact with our friends colleagues and neighbors ill never forget sitting in starbucks poring through the research results on my laptop as i soaked it in i glanced at the people around me and was overwhelmed with the thought that this is what they think of me my next reaction however shocked me i was overwhelmed with a sense of hope having access to what those around me really thought challenged me i had finally been offered a unique glimpse into the perspective of those im called to love and embrace and i was humbled embarrassed and provoked to make a difference
5733347 evangelism focus will be more relational than ever were focusing on building godly community and inviting non christian friends into that community im also more open to doing things weve not done in the past under the reasoning that our call is to reach students like specific ministry opportunities to the homeless being intentionally active in social justice issues etc specifically with the understanding that activity in these areas especially alongside non believers can be an incredibly powerful means of indirect evangelism a barrier breaker perhaps

5733398 persistent shelling in this area where two weeks ago a large number of internally displaced people sought refuge forced them to move again further inside kilinochchi

5733463 the surveys core result is that people care about their communities and express the desire to see government action taken toward local and national issues
5733464 people are hesitant to support efforts concerning global issues even though they believe that environmental quality is poorer at the global level than at the local and national level this is surprising given the media attention that global warming has recently received and reflects the division of opinion about the severity of climate change

5733467 are rallying together to denounce internet retailers that offer songs for tibet for purchase
5733468 the predictably hostile response to the album from chinese internet users and an official website at this time reflects continued attempts to suppress any support for tibet at a time of crisis for the tibetan people as well as the level of entrenched misinformation about tibet propagated by the beijing government among the chinese public

5733475 everything you need to know about the un watercourses convention
5733476 this essential treaty has languished in limbo for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
5733477 because most of the worlds transboundary river basins lack adequate legal protection the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources and this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
5733478 now when there are increasing water shortages and water quality issues world wide and climate change will only make things worse is when we need to have an effective and widely accepted agreement of global scope covering shared freshwater resources
5733479 this is about national and global security as much as human and water security
5733480 the experts are telling us that rivalries over water will be a significant source of future conflict as indeed they already are
5733481 an essential element of the response to our current water crisis and the looming escalation of that crisis is on the shelf and ready to go all we need is for the worlds nations to match their actions on water to their rhetoric
5733482 but as they enjoy the games from the comfort of their seats at the olympic stadium they should reflect on their failure to speak up for the chinese citizens who built the stadium and their hotels clean their hotel rooms serve their meals or in the case of chinese journalists try to bring them their news

5733485 i believe the olympics are a force for good and if they were not a force for good we would not sponsor them
5733486 being a good corporate sponsor of the beijing games has sadly not meant being a good corporate citizen

5733600 in fact one of our cofounders peter nichols right in front of his house there was a robbery that took place
5733601 she asked the lad to stand up which he did and told him he had been a very naughty boy because he hadnt been doing his homework
5733602 then she put on some britney spears music and got out a collar and led from her bag and told him to put them on
5733603 no one could believe it next she ordered him to get on all fours led him around the classroom and hit him 16 times one for each year on the bottom with her whip
5733604 then she took off some clothes until she was down to her bra and pants pulled out some cream put it on her buttocks and told him to rub it in
5733605 to be fair to the teacher you could tell she was just stunned and when the cream came out she told the stripper thats it thats enough
5733606 apparently the boys mum arranged the whole thing but all she wanted to do was embarrass him with a little bit of fun
5733607 she thought she had booked something like a gorilla to chase him around the classroom she certainly didnt expect anything like this
5733608 apparently minutes before the stripper turned up the mum told the teacher something was going to happen and gave her a camera to film it all

5733633 the world bombards us with messages telling us we need more money more power more gadgets more luxuries more status it is easy to believe that the next thing just beyond our reach will bring us happiness but when we finally attain it the thrill fades quickly greed traps us in an endless cycle that results in pain and heartache how can we escape the grip of our desires paul offers some practical help he contends that true fulfillment comes through a personal relationship with jesus christ and aligning our desires with christs priorities jesus offers us contentment and peace of mind that the worlds greatest riches can never bring instead of focusing on the things you do not have focus on the blessings god has give you thank him for his generous gifts to you and rely on christs power to be content in all circumstances

5733678 we let it be known with the dodgers that was the one ballclub he had interest in going to that any deal we were going to do was going to be the best baseball deal we could do and it wasnt going to be a financial deal to try to move dollars we just werent happy with the prospect we would be getting back and we chose to hold onto him
5733679 i havent seen grass in 12 months and i just wanted to feel it between my toes

5733682 there is evidence of several different types of dinosaurs inhabiting bornholm during the mesozoic
5733683 so everything indicates the dinosaurs were living there as part of a diverse ecosystem
5733684 they walked in a very shallow water lake or swamp
5733685 i think they were feeding there and simply lived in the surrounding dry land

5733688 above all monsignor higgins would be concerned about the worker the person and the family whose lives are affected by a host of factors
5733689 he would weigh up and measure all those factors by their overall impact on human beings monsignor would have pointed out the lack of union representation in so many of the emerging industries and workplaces where exploitation has been most evident

5733705 a tale of two cities in the land of serendipity the semantic web and the social web heading towards a living document in life sciences
5733706 were confident that weve gathered an exciting crop of projects
5733707 some of these very creative ideas will undoubtedly enable scientists to explore visualize and expose the meaning contained within biological journal articles more thoroughly and effectively providing better accessibility to the underlying data contained within research papers this grand challenge will give semantic publishing a kick start to the benefit of everyones research experience
5733708 as one of the judges i was thrilled and inspired to see such a diverse and creative range of proposals for how to make the daily work of scientists easier and more productive we await the semi finalists presentations in december with bated breath
5733709 the semi finalists will be given access to more than half a million life science articles including their images and supplementary files in order to build their tool
5733710 access to such a large and diverse body of work will give them the opportunity to scale up their ideas and really test them to see if they can make something that will change the way life scientists read write visualize even think about data

5733714 at this point it looks like a big disappointment or at the very least the rainfall would be delayed for several days
5733715 theres such a wide range of possiblilities were just going to have to wait
5733716 theres some hope as long as it doesnt rain itself out down there
5733717 so how are things in your house with you and audrina and lo i know that the three of you were having some problems has that gotten any better

5733721 despite the publics broken trust an fbi investigation and a flunked performance audit the port still has the authority to tax king county
5733722 no controls were in place to deter prevent or detect bribery kickbacks illegal gratuity or bid rigging schemes
5733723 resulting in delays extra costs and an inability to defend against claims
5733724 based on the agreement for the scope of work that these firms are performing it appears the port is paying attorneys up to 500 per hour to conduct information technology work thus rendering all documents subject to attorney client privilege theyre attempting to cast a wide legal net that the public cant get through
5733725 despite the publics broken trust an fbi investigation and a flunked performance audit the port still has the authority to tax king county residents without voter approval
5733726 there has been a culture at the port of seattle that eschews transparency and public accountability
5733727 i am hopeful that the new management both at the top and on the port commission will improve the ports attitude towards both
5733728 if this fails to improve the situation perhaps the federal investigation will be more pointed in achieving attitude adjustment
5733729 this is quite remarkable considering that this time last year was close to 900 pendings of sfrs and 330 pendings of condos townhomes we now have nearly double the sales wow

5733737 were much better off given the margin putting our money into educating maine voters about what this proposed law really did why its important to keep it and to begin the fall campaign
5733738 this clearly reflects how people feel right now and were moving full speed ahead to begin our campaign to urge all maine people who are fed up with high taxes to vote yes on question 1
5733739 these taxes were passed without a public hearing in the dead of night
5733740 we are certain that when the voters are informed people arent going to trade health care coverage for maine people for a few pennies on beer wine and soda

5733744 maybe i need to re examine the evidence maybe there is more to life maybe this is not all there is
5733745 this is one marketing vehicle you will want to be invested in
5733746 it is also an opportunity to advertise and spread the word about your world your business your organization affiliation or upcoming events
5733747 the new magazine is designed to appeal to a much broader audience both in terms of advertisers and readership
5733748 no other publication will work harder for you in getting the word out and developing a your presence in a very competitive market place
5733749 i felt that the surface needed something other than traditional glazes which seemed like putting on a coat of paint im attracted to the smoke firing in a barrel which changes the surface in a more natural way the forms are natural starting with a chunk of clay and then i let my hands push it around and look for a form i enjoy letting the work develop on its own
5733750 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5733751 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5733752 the issues around ethical trading are complex but more consumers are becoming interested in how the workers who made their clothes are treated so weve put out some
5733753 everybody said the market would turn positive in july before the games so we listened and stayed in it
5733754 in july they said that the markets spirit would return when the olympics came what spirit is that now we are all dead and have no spirit left in the market

5733758 the adams mcguinness leadership spent nearly two decades constructing and implementing the strategy to move from revolution to reform it was clear to mcintrye that the only possible terminus of the journey would be a settlement almost entirely constructed on british terms
5733759 the urgent problem is for us to get ready for this governors hearing
5733760 the team was a big part of my life back then and taught me so many things when i look back on my life and what im able to do its partly because of that early training it taught me discipline how to be committed about striving to win stamina all that good stuff
5733761 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5733762 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5733763 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
5733764 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
5733765 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
5733766 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
5733767 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions
5733768 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
5733769 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas

5733772 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5733773 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5733774 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not
5733775 he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure
5733776 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5733777 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5733778 that is why im proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional 1 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5733779 at least mccain has the guts to do real debates and take real questions from real people
5733780 if you can show us that the information presented in our mailer is untruthful we will stand down
5733781 at one of his town hall meetings he even paraded around a half blind demented
5733782 that stuff is so weak no one is even talking about it anymore it was meaningless even when they were talking about that was just hillary grasping at straws
5733783 no one cares that crap was weighed into months ago and no one cares
5733784 my arms hurt my arms hurt i was a p o w i am a hero ask anybody
5733785 speaking of playing cards how many times do we have to hear about mccain being a pow did he sign up for the military or was he drafted if he signed up then he needs suck it up
5733786 i was at the vfw hall a while ago and mccain was on the tv
5733787 that mother fu amp ker is as crazy as i am
5733788 speaking of playing cards how many times do we have to hear about mccain being a pow did he sign up for the military or was he drafted if he signed up then he needs suck it up
5733789 what past activities if you are going to make charges you must be specific
5733790 that mother fu amp ker is as crazy as i am
5733791 what past activities if you are going to make charges you must be specific
5733792 only when republicans do the same each action deserves a reaction
5733793 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are
5733794 unlike barack obama john mccain doesnt have to compensate for a lack of credibility on the international stage with inflammatory and public threats against american allies
5733795 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are and have a choice between strength and experience versus barack obamas rhetoric and theatrics
5733796 i love this country i will let no one question my love of this country i love america
5733797 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues
5733798 i think there is actually a very pro russia russophile coalition inside the european union which places good business relations above european values of human rights democracy and so forth
5733799 there is no eu when it comes to conflict resolution in georgia there are only member states
5733800 obstructionism seems to be a priority even when moscow shares western goals such as avoiding an iranian nuclear capacity

5733817 this contract is a crown jewel in our renewable energy portfolio
5733818 the project is attractive to sce because of its size near term delivery and its competitive price
5733819 caithness has been successfully partnering with southern california edison since the 1980s to bring renewable energy to the region
5733820 the shepherds flat project is particularly exciting and will bring a significant new renewable energy supply to the western united states
5733821 weve got to get out of the habit of thinking that we only need to focus on improving the technology that we can invent our way out of this situation
5733822 weve got to do everything we can think of including reducing the size of the task by real conservation
5733823 the need to bring better technology into production and build up volume inevitably makes the time frames for technologies to make a difference long optimists want to move faster but its not clear we can really do it much faster
5733824 transitioning from our current situation onto a path with declining fuel consumption and emissions even in the developed world will take several decades much longer than we had hoped or realized

5733845 in 2006 dozens of partners and hundreds of volunteer hands completed the fort to sea trail at lewis and clark national historical park and gave a gift to the nation
5733846 in the few years since its dedication the fort to sea trail has become an anchor for a network of community and city trail efforts this small addition will make certain that generations to come have access to the historic trail we would like to thank the conservation fund for helping the park and the community to realize their goals for the trail
5733847 this addition will expand opportunities for the public to enjoy the fort to sea trail and learn about lewis and clarks winter encampment at fort clatsop
5733848 it is important that we continue preserving oregons rich heritage and making these cultural resources more accessible for current and future generations
5733849 the park is a pioneering symbol of oregons rich history
5733850 expanding the park will help preserve the heritage of lewis and clark along with our states abundant natural resources that have endured for nearly 150 years
5733851 i am proud of all of those who work to share oregons rich history culture and environment with the millions of americans who come here to learn more about our countrys westward expansion
5733852 the columbia river plays a significant role in our national heritage and this expansion is another step in making our regions resources accessible to millions of americans
5733853 sometimes smaller conservation deals leave a big legacy and the lewis and clark trail is surely a prime example
5733854 we thank the oregon congressional delegation and the national park service for recognizing the value this property would add to the park and we also thank the ocasey family for being a good friend and neighbor to the park and wanting to add to the parks legacy
5733855 national parks have always held a special place in our hearts and now our hearts have been blessed through giving back to the national parks

5733899 the most valuable thing is the trust of the people
5733900 they the isof are the best unit in iraqs military
5733901 by learning public affairs and photojournalism skills they can show the iraqi people what isof is doing to bring peace and stability to iraq
5733902 they caught on very quickly and were creative with their stories
5733903 some of the training was rough in the beginning because this is a new subject to them but thats why we train
5733904 each day there was something new to learn about writing or photography
5733905 we were eager to take what we learned one day and carry it to the next
5733906 we are the connection between the army and the people of iraq
5733907 sometimes the people dont know what we are doing in the army
5733908 we can now tell the good things we are doing for the safety and security of our people we want iraq to be a safe place
5733909 these soldiers are doing great things all around the country and now they have individuals who are trained to tell the iraqi people about it
5733910 they can show the truth about their battle to liberate iraq
5733911 under this agreement each countrys citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents
5733912 when fulfilled the agreement we signed today will permit libya and the united states to move ahead in developing their relations
5733913 the conclusion of this agreement has been made possible also by action by the american congress which passed a new law libyan claims resolution act that president bush signed on august 4
5733914 i am optimistic that this agreement will be implemented quickly if so it will mark the completion of a process that began in 2001 that has already seen libya take steps forward as a model among nations to renounce terror and weapons of mass destruction
5733915 we look forward to developing this relationship in every aspect and to putting u s libyan relations on a sound basis in the interests of the peoples of both countries
5733916 i congratulate queenslands latest international business cadets particularly mr li he and the contribution he has made to the queensland economy
5733917 mr he was sponsored by russell mineral equipment rme and assisted them to secure a 5 5 million contract to supply a mill relining system to a chinese client
5733918 the international business cadetship program sees each cadet employed for 29 weeks during which they perform research work on behalf of the queensland organisation that is sponsoring them
5733919 of the 29 week program each cadet spends 20 weeks undertaking this research while based in one of trade queenslands 13 overseas offices
5733920 sponsors contribute 20 000 towards the overall cost of their cadet whilst also providing training to increase the cadets understanding of the organisation its products and services
5733921 by sponsoring an international business cadet queensland companies gain inside access to export market knowledge and overseas networks to increase export sales or attract investment to queensland and the cadets gain invaluable international experience the benefits are there for all parties
5733922 this year four cadets were placed in trade queensland offices in guangzhou shanghai seoul and tokyo the fourth cadet returns to queensland in october
5733923 im pleased to announce that negotiations are complete and that we have initialed an agreement
5733924 president bush has said that we recognize the need for the polish armed services to be modernized and we have offered to help in that regard
5733925 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it the purpose of missile defense is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats such as a missile from iran
5733926 i believe that one of the reasons weve seen the proliferation of these missiles in the past is that there has historically been no defense against them
5733927 so they are of a lot of value to nations like iran and north korea if we join together united states nato russia and field effective missile defenses i believe it will have an effect on the value of these weapons it will devalue them in the eyes of some of these countries
5733928 mom soap operas never allow anyone to be happy as soon as a couple finally finds love something bad has to happen to tear them apart its ridiculous im done
5733929 this is the first time weve been able to establish a program that goes from employment to entrepreneurship with the same company
5733930 the whole goal is to get veterans trained and the proper licensing thats required
5733931 from there after being a driver for schneider they can move into being an owner operator and having control of their future and owning their own truck
5733932 when our company started in the 1930s al schneider our founder sold the family car and bought a truck as his one truck business grew the drivers he hired were his friends from his wisconsin national guard unit
5733933 put a lot of emphasis on veterans hiring programs and outreach and its gone extremely well for us ever since
5733934 theres a couple key attributes to an over the road truck driver position
5733935 one is safety thats our first and primary value at schneider we want to make sure that someone understands that and really embraces safety
5733936 then its really very much about being able to independently manage yourself while youre in your truck and your manager is not with you
5733937 we really look for someone who can be comfortable under some amount of pressure someone who can make independent decisions and someone who really enjoys having that level of responsibility veterans have been a great match not only for driver jobs but many other roles at schneider
5733938 since i was hired into a leadership role at schneider national inc i quickly realized that the unique leadership challenges presented to me while a member of the air force prepared me well for my current role
5733939 being willing to accept individual accountability being unafraid to demonstrate initiative and being able to foster teamwork and develop critical thinking skill sets will be invaluable for anyone preparing for their transition out of the air force and into the corporate environment
5733940 we applaud schneider national for stepping up and volunteering to help veterans through the veterans owner operator program
5733941 clearly schneider knows the value of what veterans bring to the table perseverance teamwork and a keen ability to get the job done right
5733942 we hope that other companies learn about what were doing with schneider and theyll give some thought to how they can develop similar programs for the industries theyre in
5733943 rather than doing a cookie cutter approach i think this is something that can take on a form of its own and each one can be very different

5733960 right now were focused very heavily on getting russian forces out of georgia getting the cease fire to hold helping the georgian people
5733961 russia seems to want to have it both ways it wants to be a part of these institutions that are so essential to the international economy and the international order and on the other hand it wants to engage in kind of soviet style behavior of intimidating and invading its neighbors
5733962 we will reaffirm the commitment in the 2008 nato summit in bucharest romania and the meeting is also expected to approve a package of measures to support georgia
5733963 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5733964 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship
5733965 i think the allies are going to be firm that this was a violation of georgias territorial integrity
5733966 negotiations will begin from the premise that the territorial integrity of georgia must be respected that abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized boundaries of georgia and that we will proceed from the basis of u n security council resolutions that recognize that
5733967 georgia is a respected partner and friend and one day georgia will join nato
5733968 if the russians intended this as intimidation theyve done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5733969 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here

5733980 conr serves as part of a layered defense that protects our national airspace every day so these are core missions that we and our federal partners are undertaking to support our national conventions
5733981 its a noble duty to be able to protect these events as our citizens participate in the traditional democratic processes that define us as americans
5733982 there are a number of us who are private pilots who still get flying time in some way
5733983 we know that predator is critical to the nations defense
5733984 so its not a one way door that you go into predator and thats where you are for the rest of your career
5733985 you go down the list and everyone has a different reason for it
5733986 maybe they wanted to be closer to home yet still serve in the warfight
5733987 i fly commercially on the outside so this is the opportunity to do a mission that affects whats going on with the war every day but i still get to fly
5733988 we just got back from operation iraqi freedom doing close air support with the f 16 now we are going to do the same mission with the mq 9
5733989 looking from our perspective its really essential for the initial cadre to come from a background where they are familiar with the mission
5733990 the seasoned aviators are the people the guard brings to this fight and are exactly the people needed in the predator
5733991 not just tactically but in the flying sense the more seasoned the better
5733992 have a play around yourself remembering that you can print r or var dump the superglobal globals or even use get defined vars to find out the variable names that have been created
5733993 i was able to forget about this bad year that i had
5733994 forget about my foot injury forget about my back injury that bothered him before he broke his foot forget about everything that was bad everything that was an obstacle and focus on the moment and dive for myself
5733995 it is extremely hard to come here in china and compete against them they are so strong everywhere in the world and to be home just makes them stronger
5733996 the olympics are always a very tough competition always a very special competition
5733997 in the first round i was doing my best to think about the right things and stay focused on what i had to do but i found it very hard
5733998 tuesday morning was much more easier and my head was right and i was very very focused
5733999 playing australia gave us a chance to personally touch some of those players
5734000 how quick patrick mills was how really good david andersen is why hes one of the best players in europe how well chris anstey can still shoot
5734001 theyre a good team over the last three games averaging over 100 points a game 40 of those coming on threes so theyre shooting the heck out of the ball
5734002 if i was st marys id be happy to have him right now because hes a big time player
5734003 our veterans have answered their countrys call to duty representing americas unswerving commitment to individual human rights and dignity
5734004 i have to tell you the men and women of todays armed forces remain just as dedicated and committed to the ideals of our country as their predecessors
5734005 todays airmen soldiers sailors and marines are making tremendous contributions to our national defense from defending the skies above our homeland to capturing insurgents in iraq and afghanistan
5734006 this is much appreciated by our men and women in uniform
5734007 the exchange of information occurred in real time over a distance of 7 000 miles thanks to those satellites overhead
5734008 it is a great example of how joint teams spanning multiple military units time zones and command and control centers can achieve tremendous accomplishments
5734009 every day americas airmen integrate air space and cyberspace capabilities into the joint fight demonstrating their flexibility throughout
5734010 over 100 000 airmen have known the strain of multiple deployments
5734011 she not only accomplished her mission as a combat photographer but she also fulfilled her duties as an american airman and warrior
5734012 as she put it i was just doing my job
5734013 today we often are able to move injured warriors from theater to the united states in three days or less
5734014 additionally with advances in medical technology and operational effectiveness we are witnessing unprecedented survival rates and the lowest disease non battle injury and died of wounds rates of any conflict in u s history
5734015 during desert storm in the early 1990s for example the time sensitive targeting process could take days and during operations in the balkans during the mid to late 1990s it was reduced to hours
5734016 now in iraq and afghanistan the joint team is completing the kill chain within a few minutes
5734017 no matter how many or how few nuclear weapons we have in our arsenal the air force will remain vigilant
5734018 we have at least two constants the high quality of the airmen attracted to military service and our commitment to the core values of integrity first service before self and excellence in all we do
5734019 on behalf of the air force thank you for all you do to support todays young warriors as they defend the united states and its global interests ensuring stability and prosperity across the global commons it has been an honor to be with you today
5734020 we let it be known with the dodgers that was the one ballclub he had interest in going to that any deal we were going to do was going to be the best baseball deal we could do and it wasnt going to be a financial deal to try to move dollars we just werent happy with the prospect we would be getting back and we chose to hold onto him

5734028 and thats hard to say im pretty high on joe crede
5734029 uribes playing great out there hes making plays we never thought he would make im happy with the way hes handling that position
5734030 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5734031 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5734032 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5734033 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed

5734050 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
5734051 we dodged a bullet with the storm so thats leading to some selling

5734053 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum
5734054 he is a man made up entirely of your excuses and the minute you stop making excuses for him he will completely disappear from your life
5734055 a man who wants to make a relationship work will move mountains to keep the woman he loves if hes not calling you to tell you he loves you and wants you back it should only be because hes showing up at your new residence to do it in person if hes not doing any of that he may love you he may miss you but ultimately hes just not that into you
5734056 no matter how powerful and real your feelings may be for someone if that person cannot fully and honestly return them and therefore actively love you back these feelings mean nothing

5734070 for healthy people theres a big temptation to voluntarily restrict sleep to stay up an hour or two or get up an hour or two earlier
5734071 but youre really reducing your productivity and exposing yourself to risk
5734072 the group of people getting optimal sleep is getting smaller and smaller
5734073 when a persons sleep drops to six hours or less thats when a lot of things become very problematic
5734074 you short change yourself of sleep and you see the effects immediately you can make a bad decision you can miss something have a moments inattention and youre off the road
5734075 theres a stress response to being in a sleep loss
5734076 people pride themselves on getting little sleep youll hear people bragging i only need six hours a night so theres a macho element here
5734077 youre waking up out of sleep to breathe you cant sleep and breathe at the same time
5734078 its a risk factor for developing major cardiovascular health effects

5734096 i do not recall a year with so many thunderstorms of such intensity since ive been growing grapes
5734097 there was very little foliar damage but strangely we have some damaged berries that are already drying on the vine and are falling off
5734098 it didnt seem to affect the canopy at all it did cause a little slice on an occasional exposed berry it was not as bad as i expected not having experienced hail before the danger of course is that any wound can invite in rot organisms such as botrytis were all watching that closely

5734282 we are not going to be able to make up through wind farms all the deficit on nuclear power
5734283 we cant become a low carbon economy in a single step
5734284 this consultation is a total farce ministers have clearly already decided to back nuclear
5734285 if we want to have secure energy supplies and reduce co2 emissions we have got to put the issue of nuclear power on the agenda
5734286 disregard the issue of risk and cost and toxic waste
5734287 the fear we have is that by investing in nuclear we will invest in a dangerous dirty white elephant
5734288 by prioritising the construction of new nuclear power stations over reducing demand for energy the government is not only missing a trick it is undermining efforts to tackle climate change
5734289 whatever the rhetoric there is nothing in this white paper that will guarantee that a single nuclear power station will be built
5734290 business will only invest in nuclear power if it knows its costs it needs certainty about carbon decommissioning and waste
5734291 will be a cost effective scheme that will save over a million tonnes of carbon per year by 2020
5734292 there is a lot coal still available to me mined
5734293 this project is successful because portugals sunshine is plentiful the solar power technology is proven and government policies are supportive
5734294 eprav sem se e pred asom sprijaznil z dejstvom da mi nastop v pekingu enostavno ni usojen me je kar malo stisnilo pri srcu ko so se na olimpijskih igrah za ela gimnasti na tekmovanja
5734295 je priznal 34 letni telovadec ki je danes na aleji mladih v btc cityju navijal za petkov ka ki je bil eden od favoritov za kolajne a je po veliki napaki olimpijski nastop kon al na petem mestu
5734296 koda da se mitji ni iz lo in da je zapravil res lepo prilo nost za olimpijsko kolajno vendar nima kaj napaka se ti lahko vedno zgodi sicer upa da se ti ne bo a hudi nikoli ne po iva koda je saj je mitja pokazal da je bil res dobro pripravljen
5734297 if we dont replace the existing nuclear power stations then first i can not see how we are going to meet our climate change targets
5734298 and secondly we will end up as we move as a country from self sufficiency in gas to importing large amounts of foreign gas we are going to be dependent on very uncertain supplies of energy and that would be bad for business and bad for the consumer
5734299 the governments so called consultation was a sham and we are very pleased the judge has agreed with us on that
5734300 if tony blair wants to continue with his misguided plan for a whole new generation of nuclear power stations the government will have to go back to the drawing board
5734301 the fullest possibly public consultation and the publication of a further white paper setting out our proposals
5734302 new nuclear power stations would make a significant contribution to meeting our energy policy goals
5734303 there could be no proper consultation let alone the fullest consultation if the substance of these two issues was not consulted on before a decision was made
5734304 what it really says is that the government has been shown up as fundamentally deceitful
5734305 the judgement really shows you cant perform a 180 degree u turn on a matter as important as nuclear power without a proper public debate
5734306 its a real slap in the face for prime ministers sofa style of government
5734307 todays historic result shows that the government have got a fight on their hands
5734308 the energy review was clearly just a rubber stamping exercise for a decision the prime minister had already taken
5734309 we are waiting for the government white paper on the future of energy generation to find out what role nuclear generation is to play
5734310 but we believe nuclear power is needed as part of the solution to ensuring security of energy supply and because it is virtually carbon dioxide emission free it does not add to climate change

5734314 pharmaceutical companies invest an average of more than 500m over more than a decade to bring new medicines to patients
5734315 if they do not earn a reasonable return on this research and development cost their investors will not support this and the supply of modern medicines that enhance and save lives will dry up
5734316 what nice fails to mention is that the medicines in question are in common use elsewhere in europe where prices are typically higher than they are here in the uk
5734317 nice has an important job to do but they need to adapt their approach for cancer medicines rather than lay the blame on the process and economics of pharmaceutical innovation

5734329 the improvement signals that fear about an economic downturn among financial market experts is contained the recent fall in the price of oil and the weakening of the euro against the dollar must have dampened concerns about the economy
5734330 market experts have not been particularly taken aback by the negative growth rate of the second quarter they expect weaker but all in all solid economic conditions and do not fear a recession
5734331 the rise did not offset last months fall and the still deeply negative level means that many more investors expect the economy to deteriorate in the next six months than think that it will improve
5734332 both oil and the euro have only simply corrected their sharp advance of recent months and both have made strong gains year on year i e they are still a strain on the economy
5734333 easing pressure from oil and the euro will probably not be sufficient in themselves to trigger a renewed upswing
5734334 it has become crystal clear that markedly slower growth lies ahead as the negative momentum from the global economy is increasingly carrying over into germany

5734337 it would be easy to give in and let inflation get out of control thats what happened in the 1970s but it would be damaging and dangerous for the economy

5734380 gabbidon is still way off and wont be back until next year
5734381 weve enjoyed clean sheets against top teams like the czech republic and the germans when theyve all been fit
5734382 weve been unfortunate and while everyone gets injured even international sides with greater resources than ours would feel the pinch if it happened to them
5734383 collins is playing for west ham reserves this week and hopefully he will be available for our world cup qualifying double header with azerbaijan and russia in september
5734384 the problem is collins and gabbidon havent suffered just short injuries they havent played competitive football for the best part of 12 months
5734385 thats a long time and its always difficult for the player to get up to speed with the pace of the game
5734386 he probably wont play for west ham before then but i get the sensation that if there were premier league fixtures on that day he would play
5734387 so were hopeful about bellamy but gabbidon is way off
5734388 at this point we have no relationship and i dont see that changing
5734389 its somewhat typical of the ill luck weve had with injuries since the world cup that weve lost nikki walker for our final match of the championship
5734390 but weve made the changes with a view to giving us the best possible chance of victory tomorrow
5734391 unfortunately each week brings a new wave of threats and vulnerabilities to be managed
5734392 ignoring or deferring patches for known vulnerabilities is not a responsible strategy nor is it reasonable for most companies to disconnect their business from the internet so managing vulnerabilities simply has to be done
5734393 its a task which is consuming far too high a percentage of limited it resources
5734394 the fact that leading vendors are calling for collaborative industry wide frameworks to address threats and vulnerabilities is strong evidence of the level of pain being expressed by their top customers in this area

5734451 theres certainly a consensus on the part of the wabash parkway commission and the wabash river enhancement corporation that it would be appropriate to dissolve the parkway commission and then the efforts that they were doing would be done by the wabash river enhancement corp

5734468 however that removal provision now sits alongside a set of clauses that propose the dissolution of the entire board and the installation of a small hand picked interim board without any transparent process
5734469 that is offensive intimidatory and destructive of the security of tenure without which this body cannot protect section 16 editorial independence and the right of the public to be informed
5734470 it also puts on public display the intentions of the ruling portion of the ruling party
5734471 obviously the thinking is that the polokwane faction in parliament will decide and the new chairperson of that party will force the president to execute that decision
5734472 but that is the most primitive form of power politics it cannot be the law because it is unconstitutional
5734473 we question the constitutionality of the attempt to fudge the separation of powers between the executive and our legislature by making the appointing body of the sabc board the president in consultation with the speaker of the national assembly
5734474 the proposition that an entire board of the sabc can be removed not by due enquiry but merely after a finding of a committee of the national assembly is quite simply outrageous
5734475 it is a patently obvious intra party political manoeuvre and in so doing this honourable house is being used as a tool for the political machinations of the new post polokwane ruling clique of the anc

5734517 the mutation that causes most cases of wilson disease is well known but our study looks at the overall puzzle to see how such a small mutation can alter the shape and function of such a large and complex protein
5734518 this mutation occurs at a crucial location where the protein typically binds with a molecule called atp that provides the energy the protein needs to move copper from place to place
5734519 past studies have compared the behavior of the mutant protein with that of the nonmutant and found very little difference so it was unclear how this small change led to the devastating effects that are seen in wilson disease
5734520 this implies that the loop has some importance perhaps in regulation of atp7bs activities and we intend to follow up on this in our future studies

5734549 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled

5734557 she plays the guitar she plays the piano she sings she has so much to contribute to music
5734558 its not just going to be taking a song and singing it the winners going to have to have a lot of passion behind what theyre singing
5734559 i would tell them not to focus so much on the competitive side of singing
5734560 you just have to remember having a voice is a natural talent
5734561 vielleicht war das mal eine m hle wenn wir den umdrehen sehen wir mehr

5734585 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
5734586 religious fundamentalism continues to wreak havoc in india creating fear and instability and perpetuating the vulnerability of religious minorities
5734587 the faith of the christian community in the justice system has been severely damaged by the lack of convictions in communal attacks
5734588 we are calling on the authorities to ensure that the perpetrators of this horrendous crime be brought to justice after which they must publicly clarify the motive for the murder
5734589 we strongly condemn this attack and urge the authorities to treat it with the seriousness which it warrants ensuring that it is properly investigated and the motives thoroughly probed
5734590 christians in india face religiously motivated violence on a huge scale which routinely goes unpunished
5734591 the massive problem of impunity for perpetrators of horrendous crimes is totally incongruous with the role which india envisages for herself in the twenty first century

5734605 those two are going to complement each other real well and youre going to see a lot of playing time coming out of lennon creer and tauren poole
5734606 in what order i probably cant give you that answer right now it will probably be based upon situations
5734607 arian is a make you miss guy and montario can flat run you over lennon is a game breaker who can take it the distance and tauren does it all really well tauren has a big time maturity level thats going to get him on the field this year
5734608 the challenge for victor is to continue to be consistent and mentally and physically tough all the time

5734623 the civil service has strayed from its reformist roots and has mutated into a no accountability zone where employment is treated as an entitlement good performance as an option and accountability as someone elses problem our current system isnt fair to the many good federal workers who do not receive recognition for commitment and excellence and must pick up the slack of those who arent doing their jobs we must identify excellence in civil service reward and reward it appropriately
5734624 this type of behavior from a 42 year old woman who is supposed to be a positive role model and an educator of our young people is not just offensive to the norms of our community it is criminal
5734625 as a result my office will see that she is held accountable for her actions in the criminal court system
5734626 might be a greater detriment to the governor than anyone else
5734627 weve always been willing to walk through the door but the senate president and the governor have walked in lockstep together

5734631 long championed more money for school and education funding reform and made them his top priorities
5734632 i wanted to kick him in the chest but i actually got him in the face
5734633 accused three hassen had told me outside the house the people were prepared to get a beating and this is what i did
5734634 accused one najwa was almost like a tour guide in her house
5734635 she led accused 3 to that room and to her son and room
5734636 i said i did not mean to kick you so hard i will wipe it off
5734637 when are you going to finish with him when are you going to shoot him
5734638 at that moment the deceased said to me i have children dont kill me i told him no ones going to be killed thats not how i understand the thing
5734639 i said i did not come here to kill people fuck the job
5734640 i said what the fuck was that waheed and he told me to drive
5734641 even when the girl informed her mother about what was happening the mother would not believe her
5734642 the law will provide no advantage and could even result in deception the knowledge that a legal arrangement exists may lead consumers to mistakenly assume that the word organic appearing on labels means that the product is being supervised
5734643 those industries servicing the consumer market especially domestic trade and accommodation finance and real estate selected manufacturing industries and transport and communications will continue to feel the effects of weak household demand
5734644 the major exporters are likely to see some fall off in demand as world growth slows and commodity prices ease off recent peaks

5734646 youre just not going to go shopping when you got three kids with you
5734647 its really an event if we can capture some revenue off it terrific
5734648 it really is a true regional event that brings people downtown to celebrate the coming holidays
5734649 unfortunately each week brings a new wave of threats and vulnerabilities to be managed
5734650 ignoring or deferring patches for known vulnerabilities is not a responsible strategy nor is it reasonable for most companies to disconnect their business from the internet so managing vulnerabilities simply has to be done
5734651 its a task which is consuming far too high a percentage of limited it resources
5734652 the fact that leading vendors are calling for collaborative industry wide frameworks to address threats and vulnerabilities is strong evidence of the level of pain being expressed by their top customers in this area
5734653 youre just not going to go shopping when you got three kids with you
5734654 its really an event if we can capture some revenue off it terrific
5734655 it really is a true regional event that brings people downtown to celebrate the coming holidays
5734656 the first thing i noticed was the really jerky scrolling in applications like looking at photos and e mail lists anything that had long lists didnt like to scroll but on the previous firmware it was very very fast
5734657 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
5734658 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
5734659 this is almost like a soap opera theres so much negative press and blogging this these firmware update issues are another problem apple doesnt need at amp t as a seller of this doesnt need from a pr standpoint
5734660 political and press offences will be tried openly and in the presence of a jury in courts of justice
5734661 there will be too much traffic on a little street

5734677 god expresses in man the infinite idea forever developing itself broadening and rising higher and higher from a boundless basis
5734678 we certainly have the most vendors and i think its the most well attended
5734679 ive never seen it this crowded and each year it gets better
5734680 we sold out of everything and we doubled what we had last year
5734681 the setting is nice its a chance to see friends neighbors fellow business associates
5734682 a strong and active board of trustees is vital to achieving hamlines strategic vision as a diverse learning centered university
5734683 we are delighted with the addition of new trustees we congratulate the trustees re elected to four year terms as well as those named trustee emeritus their leadership and experience inspires us to innovate as educators and exceed expectations as a forward thinking university
5734684 if this growing trend of obesity continues our health care system will not be able to handle the rising costs
5734685 we need to move toward whole foods fruits vegetables lean meats and away from processed foods fast foods
5734686 i saw my body as a temple as something you should cherish and nourish
5734687 we need to make the healthy choice the easier choice and the less expensive choice
5734688 right now thats not the case its easier to open a bag of potato chips than to peel an orange
5734689 there is food used as rewards class parties vending machines sale of candy for fundraisers
5734690 and why should we be offering unhealthy food in schools when it is plentiful outside of school students should absolutely not be drinking soda and eating cookies and candy in school
5734691 the sad thing is for those of us in the baby boomer generation that wasnt taken as a joke
5734692 when i go to the bank they want to give my kid a lollipop

5734694 i think the first ladys steps to albany was fantastic
5734695 there is a long tradition in this area that puts the adirondacks in the right place at the right time
5734696 we have the natural aspects we have the manmade aspects we have the location we are part of the answer
5734697 gabbidon is still way off and wont be back until next year
5734698 weve enjoyed clean sheets against top teams like the czech republic and the germans when theyve all been fit
5734699 weve been unfortunate and while everyone gets injured even international sides with greater resources than ours would feel the pinch if it happened to them
5734700 collins is playing for west ham reserves this week and hopefully he will be available for our world cup qualifying double header with azerbaijan and russia in september
5734701 the problem is collins and gabbidon havent suffered just short injuries they havent played competitive football for the best part of 12 months
5734702 thats a long time and its always difficult for the player to get up to speed with the pace of the game
5734703 he probably wont play for west ham before then but i get the sensation that if there were premier league fixtures on that day he would play
5734704 so were hopeful about bellamy but gabbidon is way off
5734705 el conteo de medallas del wiki de zoho muestra que el liderazgo de china en las doradas es debido a los eventos femeninos
5734706 we can have a lot of job creation through investment in new energy markets
5734707 you have to have fiscal discipline and rein in spending where it is not a priority
5734708 reduce a busload of waste to the size of a breadbox
5734709 a truck driver friend of mine said he cant afford the diesel for his tractor trailer anymore he said owning his own rig was his idea of the american dream and now for him the american dream is collapsing
5734710 congress had better go back in september and pass a real energy bill
5734711 it should have happened 30 years ago our federal government should have had a wake up call then referring to the economic crisis caused by gas prices and inflation in the 1970s instead the federal government hit the snooze button all sides are to blame republicans and democrats
5734712 we are the largest importer of oil in the world we are getting oil from hugo chavez a known terrorist and iran as the largest importer of oil we need to decrease foreign dependency by drilling offshore and in the continental u s
5734713 i believe that washington takes spends and wastes too much of our money
5734714 washington is way out of control new yorkers are burdened with more taxes than anywhere in america i will never never vote to raise taxes
5734715 i dont want everyone to think everything is cool on main street
5734716 there was by no means a consensus among the business community and there werent answers to many questions
5734717 just the fact that hes turned out so well is hysterical
5734718 nobody wanted him he almost died twice and quite frankly he was lazy when he was young tin cup chalice is not the kind of horse you think would be successful
5734719 he isnt the type of horse thats attractive at auction
5734720 hes a gelding so he wont be a stud horse and he doesnt have an attractive pedigree some horses that are sold for millions of dollars never win a race and this horse we couldnt give him away so far hes six for six
5734721 usually the jockey gets 10 percent the trainer gets 10 percent and the owners get 80 percent
5734722 this is going to be the toughest race of his life his stiffest competition is a horse owned by a former ambassador from denmark i think that guy is worth about a half billion dollars
5734723 wed love to see him run as a 4 5 6 and 7 year old he loves to run he loves the competition and he knows his job tin cup chalice knows that his job is to finish ahead of the other horses in a race
5734724 id love to watch the race at the saranac lake branch otb everybody there knows scott and that would be fun but they wont let phoebe in so it looks like we will watch the race from home
5734725 he is bringing special skills to the mat that people have not seen before i expect him to beat these guys his training has gone fabulous he listened to what we asked him to do he followed the plan he has adopted to what we need him to use against world level competition he has accepted the plan he is going to go out and compete i expect him to do very well
5734726 what can i say im the luckiest girl in the world
5734727 shes officially off the market no one else gets her
5734728 the love we felt from the people surrounding us and the love we have for each other made this the most beautiful and emotional day

5734756 when a question is asked you answer it and you try to answer it correctly thats the way he felt and he expressed that some people cant take it some people dont understand what hes talking about he has never backed down from what he said people laughed at him when he said they would win the nl east and then as the season continued on everybody started getting excited about it jimmy is a good friend of mine its sad that he has to go through something like this but im sure hell pull himself out of it and they will get that win streak and hopefully be in the world series
5734757 in an intense fast moving contact sport like lacrosse the players safety should be at the forefront of every decision and i feel like the nfhs is encouraging safe play with its rule changes and points of emphasis for the upcoming season
5734758 it is obvious the nfhs has the athletes safety as its primary concern
5734759 the changes call for a more stringent policy on the quality of safety equipment which will encourage safer play
5734760 gloves with cut out palms have been illegal for some time but there was some wiggle room allowed if the palms had been worn out over time
5734761 there really arent any big advantages in having the palms of gloves cut out and it certainly wasnt worth the heightened chance of exposed hands while playing lacrosse
5734762 the nfhs took a step in the right direction last season by outlawing tinted visors and i personally wish they would do away with visors altogether unless they serve a medicinal purpose for an athlete
5734763 in the unfortunate case of a head injury it is imperative that medical personnel can see a players eyes for a more timely accurate diagnosis

5734773 first company to provide unified security management for both physical networks and virtual applications
5734774 strengthens auditing compliance and risk management with unified logging for the entire security infrastructure including virtual environments
5734775 many organizations mistakenly assume that their approach for securing virtual machines will be the same as securing any operating system and thus plan to apply their existing configuration guidelines standards and tools while this is a start simply applying the technologies and best practices for securing physical servers wont provide sufficient protection
5734776 security is an area of intense focus neocleus qumranet fortisphere fortinet and a few others have products that address some aspect of creating a secure environment
5734777 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used when it wishes to deliver a message that is its military power
5734778 i think the french will undoubtedly be seeking from the russians an explanation for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word

5734790 after going through all of the tapes i felt like bo and braden had a better understanding of the offense
5734791 i think theyre executing a little bit better so were going to give them the reps we will continue to give the other guys reps too but those guys will get the focus
5734792 their maturity level is well beyond what most freshmen truly are
5734793 they have that same kind of moxie that same kind of confidence and maturity that we have to see and truthfully the other players have to see too
5734794 i think the fact that hes been in big games at his high school he played in front of 62 000 in san antonio for the state championship
5734795 so hes been in big games seems to have a lot of poise confidence
5734796 i told justin hes only one or two plays away from being the guy so hes got to be ready
5734797 were going in the other direction right now but the other guys have got to be ready
5734798 i purchased the vre handbook when jonathon first listed the wso and i highly recommend it to anyone that is interested in creating multiple income streams ive created 55 of these websites so far and they are pulling a nice income for me a great read
5734799 nice one jonathon well worth many times the price i paid
5734800 im not much of a reader dont learn or absorb things well when i read them so i must admit the camtasia videos were the main reason i purchased it they were well done and a huge eye opener to the power of multiple revenue streams great one
5734801 these reports opened my eyes to the opportunity that is out there on the web i have been struggling to make an income online for a while now but now i have already created some systems and they are online making me money easily worth many times what i paid grab this now before he realizes how much of a steal this is
5734802 this is not a rehash of old stuff he has done a terrific job a great presentation worth much more than the listed price
5734803 one of the biggest eye openers i have ever had if you are looking to make money online this is a foolproof method to do so a great report at a steal its as simple as that
5734804 i cant believe i had never thought about doing something like this before i have already started doing this and the results are coming in easy to follow and easy to implement and the system handbook is just icing on the cake ive already made 10x what he is offering this report for you would be crazy not to jump on this
5734805 this tree stood through andrew katrina wilma all of them and a minor storm like this and down it comes i guess it was the straw that broke the camels back
5734806 if our method is in violation of the message people will see it quite quickly
5734807 maybe i need to re examine the evidence maybe there is more to life maybe this is not all there is
5734808 the large increase in overtime payments is likely to be largely attributable to operation sumac the large scale enquiry into the murders of five women in ipswich in december 2006
5734809 this operation saw police officers across the county working extra hours both on the enquiry and to ensure policing elsewhere in the county was maintained
5734810 hours worked as overtime are difficult to predict and usually occur when there is a major incident or serious crime which requires officers to stay on beyond their normal hours of duty
5734811 alternatively it can be pre planned as part of an ongoing operation or to deal with a developing crime series or trend
5734812 terminating the life of a whole separate unique living separate human being
5734813 its a company with people who are icons for this country
5734814 after the event in jaipur we ran a background check on hussain it revealed serious discrepancies which led to severance of our relationship with him this is normal action taken we have no other comments to offer
5734815 their attitude is aggressive and heartless and comes from a communal tendency
5734816 we admire this mans courage rashid has decided to fight against this injustice
5734817 if theyre uneducated theyre portrayed as easy recruits as terrorists and if theyre educated theyre portrayed as dangerous because they may have skills to engage in terror activities
5734818 human rights activists said hussain and other young educated muslims across india appeared to be experiencing double victimisation labelling by police and
5734819 they will definitely come back strongly they have a very good side and a lot of talented individual players who can change the match for them
5734820 the only option right now is to play more and more of him and thats the only way of getting better you can see a thousand videos but it doesnt matter until you go out there and play him off the track from 20 yards
5734821 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5734822 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into take care of business mode which was i asked them what do i do now

5734825 dishnetwork i sistemi cavo e tutte le trasmittenti che ripetono e divulgano i programmi raitalia negli stati uniti lo fanno sotto licenza della fcc federal communication commission che per una violazione simile a quella commessa il 12 agosto da raitalia che in effetti hanno diciamo ingenuamente commesso mandando in onda il servizio sebbene la legge non ammette ignoranza rischierebbero oltre ad una grossa sanzione pecuniaria anche il pericolo di essere oscurati ed avere la licenza revocata
5734826 certo questo vero fino a quando si tratta di notizie di attualit oppure di trasmissioni prodotte in italia esclusivamente per un pubblico residente allinterno dei confini italiani
5734827 lelemento pi interessante del progetto soprattutto la sua filosofia attrarre giovani talenti che se ne sono andati e che con diverse condizioni tornerebbero
5734828 gi sono tante le domande giunte da giovani italiani in italia e nel mondo il progetto finanziato dalla fondazione per il sud
5734829 abbiamo gi un centinaio di adesioni di cui una trentina provenienti dallestero il risultato molto interessante dal momento che siamo a un mese dalla chiusura del bando e ancora relativamente presto per tracciare un bilancio complessivo ma sembra che la risposta finora sia buona
5734830 attrarre giovani talenti che se ne sono andati e che con diverse condizioni tornerebbero il problema che questo progetto ovviamente non pu essere una monade ma deve entrare in un sistema di progettualit di questo genere
5734831 il progetto prosegue race non ha lambizione di risolvere il problema ma almeno di affrontarlo lalto numero di adesioni d la percezione del fatto che stando allestero si ha difficolt a rientrare sul territorio se ci fossero condizioni minime differenti probabilmente i giovani talenti allestero sarebbero pi interessati e motivati a ritornare oggi la zona del salernitano con il nuovo aeroporto in provincia di salerno una zona che pu anche candidarsi ad avere flussi turistici diversi e tutto questo muove competenze
5734832 le domande sono arrivate soprattutto dall america del sud e dall area ue in particolare da irlanda inghilterra e spagna

5734834 the desperation of these crimes speaks to the broader issue of where we are in terms of this economy

5734842 by pioneering new business models the pc has quietly remained the single leading platform for games not only in terms of consumer usage but revenue generation

5734846 we are incredibly excited and proud to have such a powerhouse team of creatives collaborating on lamb tei and soejima bring with them vast expertise and deep knowledge of japanese animation while imaginary friends studios offers world class expertise in design and art combining their creative visions with those of peach blossom media and animax i am confident we will produce an exciting new hybrid form of animation one which will be experienced in a totally different way as the story of lamb involves viewers and is unravelled across different platforms
5734847 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan

5734850 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5734851 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5734852 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5734853 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5734854 that room was totally free with no monitors a flat out lie
5734855 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5734856 a motorist survey this year by the rubber manufacturers association found that 85 percent of american drivers do not properly check tire inflation pressure this is an alarming statistic since tires are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road and a critical vehicle safety component
5734857 drivers across the u s can battle rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation
5734858 current statistics indicate that 82 million vehicles have under inflated tires which means more rubber is hitting the road and accordingly miles per gallon is lessened in fact tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas is wasted by u s drivers each year simply because theyre driving on under inflated tires
5734859 the chps traffic safety commitment extends to safety campaigns like these which aim to reduce needless fatalities and injuries on california highways
5734860 our research shows that this improper inflation issue has been prevalent for years
5734861 that andreas excuse for leveling accusation against mac you buy into that prfsr
5734862 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
5734863 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
5734864 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that
5734865 i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says i dont need god
5734866 theyre saying im totally self sufficient by myself and nobody is self sufficient to be president by themselves its too big a job
5734867 i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says i dont need god
5734868 theyre saying im totally self sufficient by myself and nobody is self sufficient to be president by themselves its too big a job
5734869 firm decisive leader time will tell if they are a majority
5734870 i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says i dont need god
5734871 theyre saying im totally self sufficient by myself and nobody is self sufficient to be president by themselves its too big a job
5734872 oh well i understand where you are coming from but i believe in this and also that
5734873 firm decisive leader time will tell if they are a majority
5734874 im lucky to be training with him hes a real inspiration
5734875 because the level of the team is so high you have to contend with that in the training sessions
5734876 they are so competitive its just moving everyone on to a new level
5734877 i didnt feel a real member of the team until i got my medal
5734878 there was no other option there was so much pressure
5734879 i tried not to think about gold because in the sprint competition its not necessarily the fastest who wins it comes down to tactics
5734880 every race you win it makes you more important for the next one but you cant take anything for granted thats why the event is as hard as it is
5734881 to just qualify for the games was amazing the silver medal might as well be gold it means the world to me
5734882 im satisfied it makes me even more excited about the future i think ive got room for improvement
5734883 its his last race and i promised a medal i lost seven kilograms i made a big effort to reach this race in good form
5734884 this is my last race and i wanted to go out with a medal
5734885 we had a good strategy with gaining a lap and staying on the lap
5734886 this was the last race of my career maybe i should rethink about the decision but it is final
5734887 we have only trained together a couple of times carles torrent fell in a race in portugal and broke his leg only three weeks ago tony knew he was going to do the madison
5734888 spend time with your family now you can work when the kids are grown but you cant ever get back that time when theyre little
5734889 one payment must be made to save on shipping with multiple items
5734890 her victory is a poor message to our youth at a time we are supposed to be raising the profile of athletics in this country the only idol they have is a drug ch eat they wouldnt let me write it properly typical bbc fascism
5734891 not as sad as those who laud her she wasnt bothered about running for gb as she said that if the ban was not overturned she would run for nigeria thats what all it meant for her
5734892 i feel a little pressure i just try not to think about it
5734893 the gold is everyones goal because whoever wins it is going to be a star
5734894 my riding style is smoother thats why they call me butter
5734895 if im going to pass its going to be clean some guys are not scared to hit you or cut you off going into a curve
5734896 i am just so pumped to be part of bmx at this stage of the sport
5734897 i have just started to bring everything together and get a lot better
5734898 all i can do is ride my bike have fun and do the best i can
5734899 if that means a medal then that would be perfect but if not i know that i will have tried my best and thats all i can ask
5734900 but now this whole paradigm is getting shifted people are paying attention to their own fitness and nutrition
5734901 people can and do get faster despite the fact that they may be 10 20 years older than when they first started
5734902 it depends on how good a person is at it
5734903 it takes a good amount of core strength and a good amount of flexibility
5734904 i am a smoother swimmer now than i was before
5734905 it is the people i swim with that make the difference
5734906 thats what gives you the motivation i could swim alone and say im tired thats not going to make me swim any faster
5734907 after swimming i feel wonderful i feel like i am getting somewhere
5734908 dont smoke get a good coach get enough sleep a full eight hours
5734909 i started swimming because i wanted to keep in shape
5734910 as long as i can drive myself to the pool i am going to keep swimming
5734911 kids are going to drink whether its legal or illegal
5734912 wed at least be able to have a more open dialogue with students about drinking as opposed to this sham where people dont want to talk about it because its a violation of the law
5734913 how many times must we relearn the lessons of prohibition
5734914 adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting signing contracts serving on juries and enlisting in the military but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5734915 its time to end the era of division which george bush brought to washington d c and move forward with a change agenda which captures the kind of unity barack obama will bring to the white house as president of the united states
5734916 he was wrong on that you cant always bat 1 000
5734917 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response
5734918 so far we have not seen any significant movement out of georgia
5734919 we have seen media reports indicating that people are being shot at while trying to leave the area
5734920 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5734921 theres nobody down there in dire straits because they dont have any food or water right now
5734922 we believe we got all the tourists and all the hikers out of there
5734923 it gives you a real impression of the force of mother nature when she shows her strength
5734924 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5734925 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5734926 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5734927 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out
5734928 it was so negligent so badly handled not only by the villagers but also by whatever agency was there that i will never go back to that place
5734929 its beautiful i would have loved to go back there
5734930 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5734931 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5734932 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5734933 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5734934 ethics is how we behave when we decide we belong together
5734935 the city would like to offer you money but the amount is up to you
5734936 the 1st amendments right to the free exercise of religion does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the antidiscrimination requirements

5734943 these conmen were very convincing and duped an elderly woman into believing their story
5734944 this site has been unused for some time and it is the councils intention to return it to a suitable state for community use
5734945 er schwirrte schon lange in unser werths ritt war nur silber wert
5734946 we are all like an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags we all fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away
5734947 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
5734948 therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall

5735175 but consumers should expect to see some differences next time they go to lease a vehicle
5735176 domestic automakers are cutting or eliminating leasing to minimize their exposure to risk in the form of further drops in residual values
5735177 but since manufacturers still want to attract former lease customers consumers can look forward to expanded finance incentives including zero percent apr and cash back offers

5735191 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5735192 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5735193 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5735194 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5735195 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5735196 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention
5735197 democrats work for solutions republicans pray the problem will go away
5735198 our goal is to provide a forum for focused collaboration to solve interesting and difficult performance problems tuneup gives developers deep visibility and relevant information to debug and improve the performance of their application and a community setting to collaborate with others to solve tough problems

5735201 its as if we automatically attributed every sale of dr pepper to the neon sign in the convenience store window
5735202 not everything that counts can be counted and not everything that can be counted counts
5735203 the seven best the ad network business is alive and strong but there are some potentially significant obstacles coming perspective patience and pacing keys to a lot more than marketing since long before the internet was invented it has been said that the difference between success

5735208 it was argentinas best match in the olympics so far
5735209 loud synchronised ululations typical in a hindu marriage while priests chanted sacred hymns
5735210 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5735211 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5735212 is not something we can negotiate bilaterally with the united states
5735213 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers
5735214 the vice president spent two minutes 20 seconds at the georgian embassy at 2209 massachusetts avenue
5735215 twenty seconds after he walked through the doorway he sat down at a wooden table took from his navy blue coat a pen and blue note card and began to write on a lined cream colored blank page of a leather bound remembrance book
5735216 he looked at his note card three times as he wrote writing pausing to look at the card and then writing again he spent 75 seconds at the task talked for 45 seconds with the hosts speaking so quietly that your pooler perhaps five feet away could catch only a few words and then departed
5735217 it certainly has been a success and has literally helped us know so many south africans it has given south africans a chance to interact directly with us and we are very grateful as we have learnt a lot
5735218 it has kept us in touch with those on the ground the women we usually read about in books and newspapers and has made us better representatives
5735219 we were not convinced we were reaching out to the ordinary south africans
5735220 so that it is not just people in leadership and at a provincial level that end up at womens parliament
5735221 but still much work needed to be done particularly with the current imbalances of women in parliament continentally and worldwide
5735222 comparing autism in 1974 with autism in 2008 is not comparing apples to oranges
5735223 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5735224 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5735225 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not
5735226 and he declared behind all of these claims and positions by lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5735227 that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how
5735228 i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5735229 if they took care of the native americans like they take care of the foreigners wed be in heaven
5735230 i am excited at the prospect of using conceptdraw office not only in our lessons but also to teach our students a tool that enables them to work in a creative and productive way im sure many other high school institutions and information technology classes will follow the increasing trend to use conceptdraw office for academic purposes
5735231 republic is planning a legal challenge saying the current rules discriminate against catholics muslims sikhs and members of other religions who object to swearing allegiance to the head of the church of england
5735232 intends to support the territorial integrity independence and sovereignty of georgia
5735233 a new line in europe where russia somehow asserts that there are those who cannot opt for a trans atlantic future is unacceptable
5735234 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5735235 assist georgia a valued and long standing partner of nato to assess the damage caused by russias military action and help restore critical services
5735236 but one can presume this issue will have to be taken into view
5735237 we need to open the door to get the military monitors in now
5735238 be nice to people on your way up because youll meet them on your way down
5735239 the cleverly expressed opposite of any generally accepted idea is worth a fortune to somebody
5735240 if you can find a path with no obstacles it probably doesnt lead anywhere
5735241 if you dont tell me a week before its really hard to slot time in
5735242 postmodern before the term was invented for the past 35 years george deem has made art that involves the quotation of art historical masterpieces his is an art of wit and quiet virtuosity presenting us with the familiar in an unfamiliar context
5735243 in the dressing room he is always the same cheerful
5735244 i would never blame individuals for the team not lifting a trophy we are in it together we win as a team and we lose as a team
5735245 as individuals we all make mistakes and the message i was relaying to a czech newspaper was that we are more experienced now and have learnt from last season
5735246 we have agreed a fee with newcastle for shola and he spent yesterday at the club having a medical
5735247 we needed competition at centre half and andy is a rabbit out of the hat thats for sure to get somebody of andys experience given the amount of games he played for hearts and internationally for scotland is fantastic
5735248 he has seen our rising status and it is a move that works for all parties he needs games and we feel he is fit enough
5735249 every signing you make has an element of risk but that is what the medical is all about
5735250 andy came through that fine and we made sure that he is strong in the areas he has had operations on
5735251 he had a hernia and a knee operation similar to the one steve brooker had and has worked hard to get himself back over the last 12 months
5735252 everyone dreams about winning but you never think its a reality
5735253 im just so proud of myself i crossed the line and just thought oh my goodness
5735254 its hard but my coach has always taught me you have to go in to each race expecting to win
5735255 branislav chose milan and he told that to the club and for that reason he will probably wear the rossoneri shirt this next season
5735256 the deal will be done because no one will keep an unhappy player
5735257 there was little food left in our house it is good they have called off protests for sometime
5735258 my love for the written word inspired me to write this book my first book was all about letter writing and how pen and paper can help you communicate with others and i thought a book praising journal writing and how pen and paper can help you communicate with yourself should be the next step
5735259 what is something you hope that readers remember most about it
5735260 i hope readers walk away with a strong desire to get to know themselves better
5735261 just like in the movies but now i think of love as a betrayal
5735262 you must educate your girls dont lose courage dont feel alone
5735263 would have been deeply perturbed with this entire social surge of civilisation to acquire this hard militant masculine self identity
5735264 in many places boys are unable to agree to find girls to marry because of this the nation will soon face an unimaginable crisis
5735265 i feel at peace i will go back to agra now and think about what i should do for my daughters and myself i will go back and think about my decision
5735266 muxtape will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa

5735290 six meat buffet the blog of choice for those of us on the atkins diet
5735291 six meat buffet is becoming a regular boner town usa god bless us everyone jihad jimmy minister of war crimes and chief defender of the faith
5735292 six meat sometimes with extra cheese and spicy peppers got brew
5735293 preston the head chef at six meat buffet wants to put his meat in your mouth
5735294 right minded thinking basted in the tasty sauce of truth
5735295 im not sure if preston is trying to put out a humorous blog or not but his writings keep me laughing
5735296 tenderized boned and free from nasty by products i love six meat buffet
5735297 one day i was looking for food on the web and i found this craphole called six meat buffet
5735298 a man and his cleaver whacking away at lipoidal thinking everywhere
5735299 smb is like pork sausage bad for you ugly to watch being made but too damned tasty to resist
5735300 what i have learned from this site is that i now know where mouth breathers and knuckle draggers come to get their rocks off
5735301 its not a score you see every day when brazil and argentina play
5735302 it was argentinas best match in the olympics so far
5735303 while no decision has been made a subcommittee of the companys board is meeting on the morning of thursday august 21 2008 to consider and make a decision on board changes as part of our response to corporate governance issues that have previously been raised and management changes in the context of our announced strategic review
5735304 the company is not in a position to release any announcement pending the result of that board subcommittee meeting
5735305 while people might aspire to living in the bush or on the coast actually the quality of life is much better in the suburbs of our major cities
5735306 the cdpp accepts that dr haneef was charged following advice given by the cdpp
5735307 a number of weaknesses in the case and deficiencies in the evidence gathered to date
5735308 the cdpp brisbane case officer has said that he felt an unspoken but extreme pressure to provide positive reassurance to police that they were lawfully entitled to charge dr haneef in circumstances where he would normally refrain from providing advice
5735309 mr keelty indicated that he did not think that at that stage of the investigation that there was a case against dr haneef but that if sufficient evidence was obtained the afp would want to move quickly on the matter
5735310 the afp commissioner later stated to the media that he expressed the opinion to the former director that he didnt think that the evidence was strong enough
5735311 this important change was discernible from the briefing paper however this change was not otherwise drawn to the cdpp officers collective attention and went unnoticed by the cdpp officers
5735312 it seems the dpp were provided with incomplete selective and misleading information the afp showed disregard for the proper ground rule for obtaining legal advice
5735313 the cdpp officers had not seen any of these documents previously
5735314 if youre telling me they want to work ill give them a go
5735315 why not ill employ anyone so long as they are willing to work
5735316 the kind of money which employers are putting up to bring them in and repatriate them would be much better invested in getting local aboriginal people a start in the local economy
5735317 the fact that weve got a substantial pool of unemployed people who are our immediate ongoing responsibility makes this an exercise in folly because obviously if any of these pacific islanders are working nearby high unemployment aboriginal towns the local people are going to feel cheated
5735318 my frustration in all this stuff is the inept failure of government to actually engage
5735319 to hear that the government are proposing to bring in more overseas workers when aboriginal people are disadvantaged in the workforce is shameful
5735320 i cant understand them importing people from other places when youve got really high unemployment in your town be it aboriginal white or what
5735321 every season we get aboriginal people here picking fruit for us
5735322 any person who comes in looking for work gets put on
5735323 in a place like robinvale thriving industry not enough workers they should be supplied from within australia
5735324 if weve got a work shortage in places like cape york and theyve got a worker shortage down here we should provide the workers
5735325 if youre going to fly people from the pacific islands whats wrong with flying people from cape york for instance or karratha or melbourne or sydney or brisbane or nhulunbuy
5735326 sick to death of watching their fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick
5735327 but we would not be getting too far ahead of the rest of the world
5735328 in fact we would still have the toughest scheme in the world because even the european union only proposes to auction 20 per cent of its permits in the ninth year of its schemes operation
5735329 auctioning only 20 per cent of permits would repeat the big mistake made by the european union when they started which was to give away permits allowing the big polluters to take windfall gains by passing on the carbon price for which they were already being fully compensated
5735330 that system is just going to create an enormous lobbying fight to get into the boat for the free permits
5735331 its going to be enormously difficult for the government to maintain the integrity of their scheme
5735332 we also think they are proposing to use an extremely crude filter with that formula to determine which companies get compensation because they are making a judgment based on revenue rather than based on a companys margins so they are not looking at a companys capacity to pay and they are making that judgment based on a few years prices which happen to be at the absolute top of the commodity cycle
5735333 there is a growing recognition in the government that they need to make haste slowly
5735334 inconsistencies and distortions not seen in public policy since the debate about gst on food
5735335 in the eu they gave windfall profits to the polluters who passed on higher prices anyway
5735336 johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
5735337 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt

5735346 i spent the early summer in austria training in salzburg
5735347 red bull sent me over they have a hockey club and they just wanted me to come over and train and see how i liked it i gave it a shot and really liked it it did me a lot of good and im in great shape now
5735348 then i went to buffalo for the development camp i met up again with the guys i know from last years development camp im back home now in new jersey and training here for the rest of the summer
5735349 hes an offensive defenseman who flew onto the charts this year
5735350 he has to become like a lot of kids going from juniors to the professional game he thinks offense but you have to be capable defensively hopefully his skating agility and his defensive awareness will improve he needs to work on his pivoting his turning to skate backwards his first couple of steps anyone can skate a straight line todays game is about wiggling around making tight turns skating in a phone booth you have to be able to maneuver get a little space and throw a puck on net
5735351 i would take it as a compliment if they are grooming me to be the power play quarterback of the future but im not sure what they have in mind for me just yet
5735352 i do have a lot of confidence that they will develop me in the right way i will hold up my end and im confident they will too i know they are dedicated to making me the best i can be and ill do my half brian campbell signed with chicago showed how great he is and how much he was wanted to be mentioned in the same category is great but i have a lot to work on hopefully one day ill be there i would love to fulfill the sabres plans for me
5735353 its going to be a shame having to move to montreal and not having the same family
5735354 i went out to newfoundland and had a great billet family that supported me so much i will always be grateful to trevor budgell and renee spurrell for what they did for me they just had a son in november jake i got really close to them we will keep in touch and they are coming to new jersey for a few weeks this summer
5735355 i was just turning 17 and it gave me a different route instead of college going to canada especially st johns that was really out there but that was what i wanted to do i will do whatever it takes to make it to the national hockey league and play for the
5735356 the guys on the team were great we had a lot of local players so we got to learn a lot about newfoundland it was so great in st johns the people were unbelievable i did really well there away from hockey i finished my senior year in high school in my first season there after the season i was able to come back to moorestown and graduate with my class that worked out really well i took university courses last season a couple of business and economics classes
5735357 i do have a lot of confidence that they will develop me in the right way i will hold up my end and im confident they will too
5735358 im guessing im going to be playing another season of canadian major junior
5735359 under the rules my only options are to play in buffalo or verdun im going to give it my best shot to make the sabres more realistically ill play one more year of juniors my ultimate goal is to make it to the nhl so i want to play where it will do me the most good if i dont make the sabres this year nothing is going to stop me from training really hard and being dedicated to improving my game and my team if i fall short in september ill know what i have to work on and i will get better
5735360 i didnt start playing until i was 10 or 11 years old
5735361 i had some friends who were playing and i started with the jaguars first in voorhees and then in evesham i was born in willingboro and grew up in moorestown went to the moorestown schools
5735362 i played five or six years for the jaguars and my freshman and sophomore seasons for moorestown high school i then played my junior year in high school for the little flyers and coach wayne sands in aston pa they wouldnt let me play high school so i just focused on the little flyers
5735363 its great to see i love to see the kids in the middle schools who are coming after us i just want to see the sport grow here and i wish there were even more people getting into it
5735364 its good to see people at the higher levels in hockey taking us more seriously

5735403 unfortunately each week brings a new wave of threats and vulnerabilities to be managed
5735404 ignoring or deferring patches for known vulnerabilities is not a responsible strategy nor is it reasonable for most companies to disconnect their business from the internet so managing vulnerabilities simply has to be done
5735405 its a task which is consuming far too high a percentage of limited it resources
5735406 the fact that leading vendors are calling for collaborative industry wide frameworks to address threats and vulnerabilities is strong evidence of the level of pain being expressed by their top customers in this area
5735407 throughout our 14 years of serving the needs of some of the top manufacturing companies in the country our customers have expressed appreciation for the depth of our solutions to their unique process and automation challenges we felt it was time we changed our name to better reflect our customized solution based business approach
5735408 for us this is much more than just a name change it is a complete recommitment by our entire staff of professionals to applying our broad process and automation engineer experience and expertise to each customers specific manufacturing situation our goal is to provide a one source complete solution thats better smarter and faster than other engineer firms even the so called industry giants
5735409 our engineers expertise in the life science industry can mean an automation solution thats not only unique to the customers requirements but will also result in a faster implementation from design through commissioning that of course means getting the plant on line quicker
5735410 incorporating sophisticated data collection and reporting into an existing system has become integral to a companys success especially in the chemical industry we are able to show customers the smartest most effective way to integrate into their existing automation system the very latest data management and it services available
5735411 those two words pretty much say it all at our company

5735418 we have had complaints about connectivity in the netherlands but have not had more complaints than usual for a 3g phone in
5735419 the first thing i noticed was the really jerky scrolling in applications like looking at photos and e mail lists anything that had long lists didnt like to scroll but on the previous firmware it was very very fast
5735420 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
5735421 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
5735422 this is almost like a soap opera theres so much negative press and blogging this these firmware update issues are another problem apple doesnt need at amp t as a seller of this doesnt need from a pr standpoint
5735423 weve re engineered the common flashlight into a more powerful tool that will help give professionals and do it yourselfers the vision to do their jobs better

5735425 we are pleased to report that we have completed the 75 million financing announced last week the proceeds will allow us to operate in the normal course as we gear up for the peak toy selling season i know this is welcome news for our suppliers our customers and our employees we are very aware that many of our current shareholders are not happy with the dilution of their ownership as a result of this financing however given the deterioration of our liquidity position i can say without reservation that this was the best alternative as part of the financing our lenders have also agreed to important changes to our credit facilities these changes combined with the 75 million of new money provide us with significant financial resources and with greater flexibility to implement our value enhancement plan restore the company to profitability and build our future we have achieved several milestones in the value enhancement plan actions already taken will generate 12 million in annualized cost savings beginning in the third quarter we have put in place many new processes to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and have completed a thorough review of our sourcing strategy and we have positioned the company to achieve better margins through value engineering price adjustments and improved product mix the sale of the stationery and activities business is following its normal course since we are in the peak selling season for these product categories the prospective buyers want to understand our most up to date results and the most complete information about the industry trend for the back to school season turning now to the second quarter results our sales were down by 15 million dollars compared to last year two thirds of the decline was in the boys 5 plus category offsetting the continued strong performance in preschool this is really a timing issue since last year most of our new products were lunched in the first two quarters while this years new launches are occurring in the third and fourth quarters the balance of the decrease was in the stationery and activities business where our emphasis since the beginning of last year has been on margin improvement most of the sales decline was due to lower margin childrens activity products which have been discontinued under our sku rationalization program our gross margins were lower due mainly to rising input costs the underutilization of our plant in china and unfavorable product mix due to the lower sales in the boys 5 plus category net loss was 3 6 million or 10 cents per share compared to net earnings of 4 0 million or 12 cents per share in the second quarter of 2007 for the six months ended june 30 2008 net loss was 13 2 million or 36 cents per share compared to a net loss of 19 9 million or 61 cents per share in the corresponding 2007 period we are also pleased to report a significant development since the closing of our second quarter financial statements we have reached an agreement in principle with our insurers for the recovery of an additional 9 3 million related to the settlement of lawsuits for magnet ingestion recorded in 2006 we expect to receive payment shortly and to record this amount in our third quarter results this means we have recovered almost the full amount of our 13 5 million settlement looking ahead the next two quarters are traditionally the strongest in our business and our objective is to restore profitability an important factor in our success will be our ability to reduce and offset cost pressures particularly in china we are very focused on costs efficiency and margin improvement through our value enhancement plan of equal importance we need to build sales momentum and i believe we are well positioned to succeed we have great innovation in our boys category this year with all of the new products hitting retail in the third and fourth quarters listings at major retailers are higher than last year magnext is also starting to get good retail support the first launch event took place last saturday with a building competition at over 500 toys r us stores across the united states generating a lot of buzz for this new brand our preschool line up is stronger than ever and on pace for another record breaking year with the launch of the new boys line up and magnext in our key european markets and other countries later this year international sales will be energized in closing i would like to address some comments to our employees the past few weeks have been very challenging speculation and rumours created a cloud over our company and i know it has been a very difficult period for all the members of our team better days are ahead the 75 million of new money we have just received together with the agreement with our lenders is a vote of confidence in our people our brands and our innovation we now have new investors with a long term outlook our founder and chairman of the board is also investing further in the company as part of this financing we have great products and we have a plan now we also have the financial resources to turn our business around and restore the value of our company for the benefit of all stakeholders

5735500 world oil reserves have probably peaked yesterday today or tomorrow literally right about now
5735501 production worldwide will start declining relatively soon we are right at that point
5735502 rest assured that for nearly 100 years people have been looking for super large oil finds so it is not too likely there will be more of those
5735503 we have had booms and busts in the oil industry for almost a century with each one getting a little bigger the last bust was in 1980
5735504 as long as crude oil was inexpensive it was hard to beat
5735505 it is like water generated electricity put up a dam and let water turn turbines when other sources of energy are not readily available the price of oil goes up lots of alternative fuels are feasible financially now only because of the current high cost of oil but technology has not been put in place to take advantage of that situation and rapidly move forward with alternative methods almost anything we can do in this country for large scale energy production will take five to ten years to start delivery on a large scale
5735506 just because we conserve wont cause the price of oil to magically change because there is increasing world demand
5735507 conserving could help stabilize what is going on but it is not going to cause a decrease in the cost of oil
5735508 clean coal technology is tremendously better but we arent there yet
5735509 we arent ready it is going to take minimum of fivers sic 10 years for clean coal technologies to start helping the situation it is now economically feasible because of oil prices when it wasnt five years ago economics plays a big part but we needed more proactiveness to it to be ready for what was coming i blame politicians for sticking their heads in the sand for the past 25 years

5735519 act to promote cost containment transparency and efficiency in the delivery of quality health care
5735520 it is intended to provide extra cost savings needed to fund massachusetts sweeping 2006 health care reform package that requires state residents to purchase health insurance
5735521 help ensure health care providers make choices about prescription drugs and medical devices for their patients based on therapeutic benefits and cost effectiveness
5735522 i am confident the department of public health pursuant to its regulatory authority will safeguard the confidentiality of companies trade secrets and proprietary information and protect against roadblocks to medical research or the education of health care providers
5735523 costs of travel lodging or other personal expenses of non faculty health care practitioners
5735524 payment for reasonable expenses necessary for technical training on the use of a medical device if that expense is part of the vendors purchase contract
5735525 its too early to tell what negative impact this will have with any assurance
5735526 we are really going to have to see what the regulations look like
5735527 what we are hoping is that we will be working with the massachusetts department of public health to develop regulations that will address some of these concerns and allow us to resolve some of these seemingly very difficult issues
5735528 unlike other segments of the health care sector medical technology is often developed and refined based on input from physicians who have direct and constant feedback from their patients
5735529 for device companies this is a very big issue because we tend to provide training and educational events for health care professionals at a corporate training center or at another site thats not in the doctors office or the hospital setting
5735530 so there is no allowance for health care professionals to test drive medical equipment prior to making an educated choice about which device they choose which device they select for their office their clinic their hospital
5735531 it does not have the type of exceptions that we deem critical to the promotion of advanced medical technology
5735532 we dont see that here in massachusetts and thats of great concern to us
5735533 if every state has its own database that has different reporting elements different exclusion elements different inclusions different reporting thresholds for example different labels associated with the amounts that are reported it will only confuse patients and it will not promote the goals of the legislation
5735534 you have to go into each state and look at their legislation and you have to keep a running tab in each state of whats going on that is a resource intensive thing
5735535 that physicians in massachusetts will be discouraged from collaborations with the medical device industry and that in essence would drive a lot of clinical research out of the state

5735563 i think the captain is very important because he is the driver of the team

5735571 weve seen ehealthforum triple its traffic in a year 15 percent in the last two months actually more noticeably a dramatic increase of visitors to our ask a doctor section on average over 100 people are seeking our doctors advice per day it has become apparent that more and more people are checking out medical advice online before visiting their regular doctor or they want a second opinion
5735572 more and more people find the unconditional support from others in our forums play a significant role in the healing process indeed many of our visitors go on to become volunteers posting responses help and support on other peoples posts caring and sharing is a great healer in itself many of our visitors discover that others have had similar experiences which they find enormously helpful a problem shared is a problem halved and thats half the battle
5735573 as technology develops i think we might see more and more people turn to online consultations and i hope to be on the edge of that movement
5735574 bisogna distinguere i ruoli un cristiano che fa politica ovviamente nel suo agire deve assumere la mediazione il compromesso un giornale cattolico deve invece avere un minimo di profezia non guardare solo al contingente io credo che famiglia cristiana stia svolgendo un ruolo utile
5735575 evocare il fascismo una provocazione ma dico unaltra cosa i paradossi servono per far riflettere famiglia cristiana non una rivista qualunque una rivista cattolica deve spingere i cattolici al di l della collocazione politica a interrogarsi altrimenti diventa una rivista uguale alle altre
5735576 alla sua ispirazione cristiana quando ad esempio fa una riflessione sui rom in perfetta sintonia con linsegnamento di benedetto xvi che parla di valori non negoziabili
5735577 nei termini in cui si declinata nel nostro paese finita
5735578 non esiste nemmeno quella la dc stata unesperienza che ha contribuito a costruire la repubblica in tempi di scontro ideologico il suo merito se posso usare un paradosso stato quello di aver tradotto laicamente laggettivo cristiana costruendo una democrazia per tutti
5735579 significa non privatizzare la fede e declinarla nellagire politico una presenza organizzata di cattolici importante anche per chi ha scelto altri schieramenti oggi non c la pretesa democristiana dellunit politica ma lambizione di esprimere un pensiero di non lasciarlo evaporare

5735581 io dico che dipende dai programmi in campo e da come evolver il pdl anche se ho perplessit e anche tante sul nostro rapporto con berlusconi cos come siamo siamo distanti
5735582 si ma in italia abbiamo idee diverse noi ci riferiamo alle componenti pi liberali e progressiste del partito popolare europeo mentre il pdl ha una connotazione di destra
5735583 mettere in discussione il bipartitismo e creare unarticolazione politica diversa da quella attuale una cosa la dico chiaramente lunione di centro e resta allopposizione noi vogliamo costruire un soggetto autonomo da pd e da pdl poi ci confronteremo sui programmi
5735584 no anzi tutto perch non si capisce che identit ha luno o laltro forno poi la politica dei due forni andava bene quando lalternanza non cera noi diciamo alluno e allaltro polo quale idea di paese hai
5735585 no non pensiamo a una posizione terzista ma a una posizione centrale le alleanze servono ma dipende dal tipo di programma
5735586 penso ad alleanze a geometria variabile chiaramente le alleanze devono essere fatte coinvolgendo tutte le componenti dellunione di centro se qualcuno pensa di fare alleanze muovendosi in modo autonomo noi non ci stiamo
5735587 in alcune regioni potremmo allearci con il pd in altre con pdl o con altri e non escludo nemmeno la presentazione di liste centriste il territorio va spoliticizzato da roma visto che ha una sua dimensione autonoma lo scontro ideologico che ha ricondotto tutto a una logica nazionale ora invece dobbiamo ritornare allo schema sturziano
5735588 in una coalizione con di pietro e con rifondazione avrei delle difficolt a stare anche a livello territoriale

5735686 in our quest to deliver top flight arena football to sports fans throughout the new york metropolitan area the re signing of aaron garcia is the linchpin

5735688 im excited to continue my new york career and help our young team take the next step in our bid to win a championship
5735689 the sting of last seasons playoff loss to philadelphia and the controversial call that played such a key part in the games outcome still lingers my teammates and i still have some unfinished business to take care of i believe were on the verge of a special 2009 season given our mix of youth athleticism toughness and experience the backing of new ownership coupled with our strong play can only help entrench the dragons into the mainstream of the new york sports and entertainment scenes i want to be a key part of that effort
5735690 the re signing of aaron garcia illustrates the new ownerships commitment to building a consistent winner and dynamic football team for new york sports fans

5735705 a tour de force of research synthesis contrast and plainly delightful characterizations phelan not only carries the reader to the heart of the american experience of the era but draws from so many insights on so many levels that she leaves the reader overwhelmingly satisfied with revelation

5735708 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
5735709 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
5735710 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
5735711 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
5735712 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
5735713 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
5735714 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
5735715 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
5735716 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
5735717 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
5735718 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
5735719 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
5735720 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
5735721 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
5735722 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
5735723 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
5735724 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
5735725 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
5735726 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
5735727 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
5735728 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
5735729 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
5735730 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
5735731 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
5735732 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
5735733 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
5735734 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
5735735 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
5735736 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
5735737 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
5735738 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
5735739 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
5735740 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
5735741 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone

5735760 designer denim is rarely if ever sold at a discount so its really exciting to bring all these great brands together in one place at below wholesale prices
5735761 with racks and racks of organized inventory group fitting rooms and a helpful staff tung wants to ensure high end shoppers still get what he calls
5735762 all in all everyone loves fashion even more when its at a bargain price and we are here to make that happen
5735763 we believe that to look good you have to feel good and with prices like this you cant help but to feel good
5735764 our patients have been asking for a way to solve a number of skin issues without the need for surgery or multiple procedures california lifestyles almost guarantee an unpleasant change in skin texture and color balance with evidence of premature aging the natural progression of collagen breakdown eventually presents itself by way of wrinkles and skin laxity the re pair laser targets all these issues with a short downtime one time procedure
5735765 granted in the case of severe laxity the re pair does not replace traditional plastic surgery but when used correctly in the hands of a skilled and experienced laser physician it can provide a single treatment solution to the multiple problems created by sun damage and the initial laxity caused by aging were successfully treating patients well into their 60s before the re pair laser there was no way you could get this multiple effect response without serious and complicated recovery time
5735766 we are using the re pair clinically to improve the surface plane of the skin for those suffering from acne scarring
5735767 much acne scarred skin has developed deep tough scar membrane which is resistant to surface depth procedures making it very difficult to restore a level skin surface
5735768 fully combating the effects of age related facial laxity is not just a matter of tightening volume deficits are created by bone loss and fat loss in the skin volume restoration plays an important part in rebalancing the 3 d contours of the face
5735769 blend in volume restoration using injectables such as radiesse and sculptra with the fraxel re pair and i wont be surprised to see some phenomenal outcomes
5735770 damp will be the weather yet hot the pyre in my backyard
5735771 so why not read the books and talk about them too
5735772 i was going for faster faster faster but something in me was rejecting that
5735773 it wasnt clear that the world needed faster faster faster so i began thinking about the opposite working on the fastest machine in the world got me thinking about the slowest
5735774 its the only 10 000 year forward thing i know of
5735775 in my little back of the napkin sketch i drew a picture showing a clock with concentric walls around it
5735776 i proposed that you could have a system of gates where it was open for a while at a certain time of year or decade or whatever when you could go in and out freely but if you were inside it when the gate closed youd be making a commitment to stay in until it opened again and i talked about clock monks who would tend the clock i put that idea in cold storage because i was working on the baroque cycle when i recovered i decided what the hell im just going to try writing this
5735777 youve got manuscripts that are relatively short and then youve got manuscripts that are taller than they are wide and then youve got ones that are taller than they are long
5735778 i was thinking shorter but once youve done all the work to build the project and get the reader into it theres the temptation to keep it going
5735779 their way of glorifying and expressing respect for ideas and thinkers that are important to them
5735780 i could never get that idea the notion that society in general is becoming aliterate out of my head
5735781 people who write books people who work in universities who work on big projects for a long time are on a diverging course from the rest of society slowly the two cultures just get further and further apart
5735782 one of the more interesting things about the project has been what anybody adds to it
5735783 clearly neals imagination is extraordinary he creates a whole world in his mind hes got every building imagined in more detail than its described in the book
5735784 were not planning on locking up people for thousands of years
5735785 i played the role of mephistopheles in christopher marlowes doctor faustus and on the technical side made a full size mechanical kong hand that at one point in the play reaches through a window and drags somebody offstage
5735786 we heard that tom clancy had made something like 17 million the previous year and thought if we could snag 1 percent of that wed still be ok
5735787 i was sort of going for broke with snow crash
5735788 i had tried to write stuff that was more conventional and that would be appealing to a large audience and it didnt work i figured i would just go for broke write something really weird and not be so worried about whether it was a good career move or not
5735789 in neals books hes been fantastically good at creating scenarios and technologies that are purely imaginary
5735790 its an insanely ambitious project it is a total folly
5735791 it presents itself as rational but thats like presenting the pyramids as rational
5735792 if i had to do a book tour every day it would kill me but four weeks every four years isnt too much to ask
5735793 its a pseudo liturgical use of mathematics and higher thinking
5735794 its really about the difference between people who can sit down and focus their attention for a long period of time on something complicated in a patient and steady way versus people who never read anything longer than a sentence or paragraph and who get very impatient if you try to go on at any length
5735795 when im working on a book i need to be uninterrupted a long attention span kind of thing on the other hand there are a lot of things in my life that are important and keep me communicating over email its harder for me even to read books than it used to be and theres an obvious irony there
5735796 bluefish tv studies have some of the highest quality content and production values that ive seen in a long time
5735797 we are thrilled to partner again with lifechurch tv and have appreciated the partnerships in the past with other organizations like fca and lakepointe in using our resources we look forward to serving many other ministries in the future

5735894 the fact that 2008s extent isnt significantly below the 2007 number because of the aforementioned claimed problem of lacking multi year ice is simply remarkable so much for the predictions of a worse year

5735919 in line with our mission we are always looking for ways to help laboratories realize efficiencies though the deployment of leading lims technologies

5735921 integrations can be daunting however using nautilus lims and the labcentrix affinity package laboratories can easily integrate with affymetrix

5735937 we are excited to be working with somatic digital to further extend access to our high quality content to a wide range of specialized learners

5735939 to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be
5735940 well if id known it would have been such a problem i would not have even brought it up in the first place
5735941 thus far and no farther you have indulged your human creation for thousands of years you have acted out your rebellion against god for too many lifetimes and this time this is it your decision and your decree in this situation will be the telling one
5735942 either you renounce your recalcitrance and make an about face now or you may no longer be considered a chela of the great white brotherhood
5735943 the prince of this world cometh and hath findeth nothing in me
5735944 now i the one sent charge you to bind and cast out that carnal mind which is enmity with god if you would dwell forevermore with the father and the son
5735945 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
5735946 in the mid 1990s ayers and dohrn hosted a meet and greet at their house to introduce obama to their neighbors during his first run for the illinois senate in 2001 ayers contributed 200 to obamas campaign ayers also served alongside obama between december 1999 and december 2002 on the board of the not for profit woods fund of chicago that board met four times a year and members would see each other at occasional dinners the group hosted
5735947 nothing more than an aging lefty with a foolish past who is doing good and while yes obama is friendly with ayers it appears to be only in the way of two community activists whose circles overlap
5735948 the real story of this debate may be where one of the moderators found his questions

5735970 in the name of jesus christ thus far and no farther enough
5735971 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5735972 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5735973 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5735974 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5735975 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5735976 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
5735977 in our recent work we have demonstrated that piraha speakers achieve high accuracy on matching tasks despite having no count words whatsoever not even a word for one

5736010 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5736011 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5736012 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5736013 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5736014 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5736015 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers

5736019 all that will be lost if this new fence is built
5736020 if its like the fencing put up elsewhere along the border near san diego there will be two fences made with triple strength concertina wire
5736021 there will be one fence 150 meter dead zone thats big enough for a vehicle to drive and then the second fence
5736022 ninety percent of illegal migrants on that part of the border come through a legal port of entry either smuggled in a vehicle crated in tractor trailers or they come legally and overstay their visa
5736023 the logic of building the fence makes very little sense
5736024 i was detained for visiting a park where north meets south and the pacific crashes against the land a park that i have visited all of my life
5736025 i was detained for bearing witness to the ongoing destruction of that park for a triple fence will bypass the last place where families can still come together and see each other through the wall of death that separates our families and communities
5736026 in my mind and the mind of many here in the san diego tijuana border region a high wall or other barriers will never take our friendship away

5736031 como conclusi n de lo anterior debe decirse que hubo un exceso en el uso del derecho a despedir que se debi a la mala fe de quien reprende al que en ejercicio de un derecho constitucional constituye junto a otros compa eros un sindicato

5736119 lo que quiero presentar son los hallazgos que hemos hecho en un conjunto de yacimientos conocido como la sierra atapuerca en espa a muy cerca de la ciudad de burgos estos yacimientos documentan lo que es la evoluci n humana en el continente europeo desde sus inicios
5736120 ah se han encontrado los f siles m s antiguos al d a de hoy en europa que tienen un mill n 200 mil a os
5736121 este mismo debate est llev ndose a cabo en am rica porque hace 10 a os en los libros se le a que el hombre hab a llegado a am rica hace unos 12 mil a os pero ahora se han encontrado evidencias que va m s all y es casi el doble de antig edad
5736122 la finalidad del curso es formar un grupo de oficiales que puedan intervenir de inmediato ante una emergencia masiva relacionada con el terrorismo por tratarse de una zona fronteriza con estados unidos
5736123 antes del curso cada oficial fue sometido a un examen de conocimientos por la unidad modelo de la academia regional para conocer el nivel de preparaci n de cada elemento e identificar los puntos de formaci n policial que se requiere reforzar
5736124 or whether or not the government needs a new mandate
5736125 we did establish a fixed date for the next election that said in this minority parliament two of the parties the bloc quebecois and the ndp have indicated for some months now that they want an election immediately
5736126 liberal leader stephane dion has indicated that the government should be defeated but hes not sure when hell do that because he doesnt have good enough polls i dont think thats a particularly responsible position

5736128 me siento feliz despu s de casi 20 a os en los escenarios es un terreno nuevo para m estoy principalmente agradecida con morris gilbert por la oportunidad aunque tampoco fue gratis tuve que hacer audiciones y prepararme mucho es el primer paso de una carrera en el teatro musical
5736129 me temblaban las manos al inicio cuando ten a que cargar un libro y cantar pero todo sali bien
5736130 tengo colecciones de las pel culas de disney y cuando se anunciaron las audiciones de la bella y la bestia
5736131 y luch por hacer realidad mi sue o lo m s dif cil fue empatar con el ritmo del reparto pues casi llevan 400 representaciones y lo hacen casi hasta dormidos ya que ofrecen ocho funciones a la semana
5736132 incluso ped que me prestar n un sal n de abajo para ensayar aunque fueron muy pocos ensayos yo entiendo que lolita cort s lo hace con facilidad pero aqu se trat de mi debut en teatro y me sent a nerviosa me pusieron en el monitor la obra en tiempo real y entonces yo lo iba practicando
5736133 desde entonces me pidieron que les apartara lugares y me da mucho gusto porque sigue habiendo cari o fueron varios a os arriba del escenario y seguimos siendo amigos como no estaban trabajando en este momento pudieron venir y qu bueno
5736134 este trabajo es a menudo peligroso pero nuestra determinaci n es tan fuerte como siempre
5736135 hubieran querido que sigui ramos adelante y lo hemos hecho
5736136 hell why not it cant be that bad or bloated these parts should be able to play with it a little even if it takes a whole minute to boot and 2 to shutdown with aero and half of the services disabled
5736137 omg why did i buy this utter piece of crappy hardware i knew intel was all the rage 2 wtf
5736138 lets turn off aero superfetcher uac half of the services and i will be fine yeah it must survive this way
5736139 lets do that one fine reboot and see the pwnage mwuhahaha this rig will have to sweat even then

5736144 its important for us to hold airlines and airplane manufacturers accountable for the losses and irreparable harm theyve brought on these families and to ensure that the safety of the flying public be of paramount importance now and in the future
5736145 one of our missions is to ensure the families we represent are taken care of through the course of investigation its imperative that the families we represent are provided with professional guidance and advice to bring as much emotional and financial stability to their lives as possible in the aftermath of such a disaster and by bringing a civil action we can increase the likelihood that other families will never suffer a similar loss
5736146 while providing aggressive legal representation in the quest to hold those responsible for the losses of our clients its important we focus on making changes within the aviation industry to help prevent future accidents
5736147 part of our mission is to promote aviation safety and to bring about change in the industry such as pilot training maintenance practices design and manufacture of airplanes

5736168 this is usually because the parent feels they havent got all the information they need from their son or daughter and so phone back to double check and clarify points
5736169 all universities now have to take the parent factor into account on university open days you can see more parents attending than children
5736170 there is a powerful sense of infantilism where parents cant let go
5736171 we have to remind parents that there is a professional relationship between academics and students
5736172 these parents are paying more so they think they can demand more

5736181 data are the past the question that the fed must wrestle with is what will occur on the inflation front going forward
5736182 might digest and dispatch the recent inflationary surge or he might gag on it it is too early to tell
5736183 the july inflation numbers were absolutely ugly but they probably reflect the peak of inflation there is a lot of evidence showing substantially slower growth in the rest of the world
5736184 if the fed is too slow to raise rates then yeah you could get a more meaningful inflation buildup but thats probably not going to happen

5736187 inflation will continue to be a concern but the real worryis still in the housing market
5736188 we will continue to have bleak data for a while we knowfrom the japanese example that a housing slump usually lasts forlonger than economists can think of
5736189 the topline is a bit behind the curve that will fall in the future
5736190 right now it has not really taken into account the recent decrease in energy prices
5736191 if you are seeing the other big component of inflation go down a bit that could indicate a positive for the future

5736201 tuve algunas conversaciones pero la realidad es que no voy a estar trabajando para la actc no va a ser como se dijo o como yo dije en su momento
5736202 si bien no tengo ciento por ciento definido c mo voy a trabajar el a o que viene es muy probable que lo siga haciendo como hasta ahora
5736203 todav a no nos sentamos a charlar de qu manera vamos a trabajar el a o que viene pero es muy probable que siga ligado a los mismos clientes que tengo esta temporada

5736207 theyre heavily concentrated in states where home prices are plummeting
5736208 it was pretty evident that the only thing that was supporting these
5736209 the home buying public is going to have to pay
5736210 to stay competitive in the market and take steps to preserve market share
5736211 i ask every higher education leader who has signed to reconsider i am old enough to remember life on our campuses before the 21 year drinking rule it was horrible
5736212 were closer to the end of the credit crisis than we are to the beginning
5736213 rebuilding the liberal party after the 2007 federal election defeat was always going to be difficult
5736214 what is more important is to find means by which we can redistribute our economic gains to the benefit of all
5736215 there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
5736216 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development
5736217 certainly there is no limit to taxation if the benefits derived from public services by society measure up to the cost in taxation which they have to pay
5736218 it is a fallacy to say that there is this limit and it is a fallacy to rely mainly on individual free enterprise to get the savings
5736219 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
5736220 we can only compete if our government makes the investments that give us a fighting chance
5736221 and if we know that our families have some net beneath which they cannot fall
5736222 if left to the individual consolidation will take a long time to come we have to look at priorities in terms of what is good for society and on this basis we may find it necessary to force people to do things they would not do otherwise
5736223 the government should restrict the size of farms that can be owned by one individual throughout the country
5736224 one who has read marx cannot fail to see that corporations are not only what marx referred to as the advanced stage of capitalism
5736225 but marx even called it finance capitalism by which a few would control the finances of so many and through this have not only economic power but political power as well
5736226 we hold them up as role models and our mythology is steeped in stories of men on the make
5736227 the problems of poverty and racism the uninsured and the unemployed are rooted in the desire among those at the top of the social ladder to maintain their wealth and status whatever the cost
5736228 i did feel that there was something to prove to my father
5736229 word got back to kenyatta that the old man was a troublemaker and he was called in to see the president
5736230 the vice president spent two minutes 20 seconds at the georgian embassy at 2209 massachusetts avenue
5736231 twenty seconds after he walked through the doorway he sat down at a wooden table took from his navy blue coat a pen and blue note card and began to write on a lined cream colored blank page of a leather bound remembrance book
5736232 he looked at his note card three times as he wrote writing pausing to look at the card and then writing again he spent 75 seconds at the task talked for 45 seconds with the hosts speaking so quietly that your pooler perhaps five feet away could catch only a few words and then departed
5736233 its one of those situations where the devil is in the details
5736234 have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil
5736235 what im trying to do is create a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code
5736236 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich i dont believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth
5736237 a studio source tells us today that the long gestating
5736238 will be headed to a blockbuster store near you or more accurately to netflix sometime next year its the next film they hope to do
5736239 will be made on a pretty most budget so dont expect any of the headline stars of the original thomas jane or ll cool j for instance to return at the moment nobodys on board its merely got writers no renny harlin either wait that might be a good thing on it probably wont be cast until after the black cloud hanging over the impending actors strike subsides
5736240 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source
5736241 our debate on the budget has become very partisan and having our debate i think is very important for the people of the state of california the republican speakers have mentioned on several occasions that the democrats are interested in raising taxes
5736242 if the spending cap was in place today would the rules and the procedures offered in this constitutional amendment from the republicans allow for us to address the housing crisis the answer is no would it allow us to deal with the rising unemployment the answer is no would it allow us to fund after school programs to deal with our growing dropout problems in the state of california the answer in the republican plan is no one of the things were saying is that the democrats are proposing a budget and the budget stands for something california must stand for something education needs to be a priority now let me just address this question of higher taxes to the average californian are they talking about you when they say they dont want your taxes raised i dont think so theyre talking about the people who would have to pay under this plan who make 500 000 a year they dont want them to pay any more taxes theyre talking about corporations corporations that need to pay the rate they were paying in 1997 because its important for everyone to be accountable and to share responsibilities at this moment but what theyre not telling you is this the average californian without the help of the state will pay more because were talking about your priorities they will pay more because you will have a parcel tax in your school district and you want your children to learn so youll pay more so we dont act we shift the burden to your school district they want us to cut health to the poor and the needy so that we dont raise taxes in sacramento so we dont get those who make 500 000 a year and those corporations to share but does that give you any tax relief in your county and your town no because those patients will show up in your county hospital in your trauma center and you have to raise money in your county and again weve shifted the burden now its time for some accountability and some truth telling this budget is before this house this budget should be acted on not as democrats and republican but as conscientious legislators who committed themselves to this constitution to serve the needs of the citizens of this state our people in this state are hurting i say to you all my colleagues cast your vote i say to the people of california watch that vote if you dont like it tell your legislator about it we have to get on with a budget that serves the needs of the people of this state

5736258 our recent studies into what occurs during the chemical reaction caused by tamls proves that the catalysts are indeed really close mimics of peroxidase enzymes
5736259 by knowing the mechanics of the reactions we can fine tune the catalysts for even better performance
5736260 this is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere
5736261 ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards what we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in san diego and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulfur rich particles called primary sulfate would be so high
5736262 the importance of primary sulfate is usually ignored in assessments of the impact of ship emissions on air quality because less than 7 percent of all sulfur emitted by ships is found in primary sulfate particles
5736263 but our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future knowing how much sulfate from ships is in the air will also allow us to better understand what happens to the other 93 percent of sulfur emitted by ships
5736264 we found that in san diego the port of los angeles can be a significant influence on air quality because these fine particulates can travel so far
5736265 this will tell us whether californias new regulation requiring cleaner burning fuel 24 miles off the coast is having the effect its intended to have
5736266 and because a large part of the worlds population live in major cities with shipping ports such as new york city san francisco hong kong houston and singapore and global shipping is expected to increase in the decades to come this should help policy makers around the world make more informed decisions about improving the health of their citizens
5736267 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
5736268 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die
5736269 daughter cell gene expression is special and now we know why
5736270 everyone figured that the acaricides anti varroa mite chemicals would be present in the wax because the wax is reprocessed to form the structure of the hives
5736271 it was a bit of a shock to see the levels and the widespread presence of these pesticides
5736272 we already had in place ways to test for viruses bacteria and fungi but it was difficult to find an analytical laboratory that could analyze for unknown pesticides
5736273 we needed them to take a comprehensive look at all pesticides not just those associated with beekeeping
5736274 when we began doing this work honey was not regularly analyzed and bee pollen was not a commodity and so was not analyzed
5736275 we decided to go with the types of screening the lab does for milk and apples which look at over 170 pesticides now honey is included in the commodities to be analyzed
5736276 simplicity was important because there were many people across the country sampling for us
5736277 now rather than having them collect 15 grams of pollen they need only collect 3 grams
5736278 gamma radiation is often used to kill viruses and other disease causing agents
5736279 we are finding fungicides that function by inhibiting the steroid metabolism in the fungal diseases they target but these chemicals also affect similar enzymes in other organisms
5736280 these fungicides in combination with pyrethroids and or neonicotinoids can sometimes have a synergistic effect 100s of times more toxic than any of the pesticides individually
5736281 we do not know that these chemicals have anything to do with colony collapse disorder but they are definitely stressors in the home and in the food sources
5736282 pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of ccd we believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors possibly including mites viruses and pesticides
5736283 we now want to look at small versus large operations and organic versus nonorganic operations to see if there are differences
5736284 our previous studies showed that soft landing can be used to prepare ultrapure peptide layers on substrates the question we faced was in addition to controlling purity can we also control the structure of the molecules we showed we could
5736285 because we were starting from something that wasnt helical in solution we were a little pessimistic whether it would work at all
5736286 we found an interesting pathway to conduct different types of chemical reactions between complex molecules and substrates that will potentially enable us to prepare materials that cannot be made by standard methods
5736287 we hope to conduct lots of chemistry on the thin films
5736288 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems we now know we can focus on these genes and potentially change the ultimate course of many diseases that have a major impact on peoples lives
5736289 even if you have lots of sequence for complex communities it still doesnt tell you which organism is responsible for which function
5736290 this publication presents an approach via simplification and targeted metagenomic sequencing of how you can go after the function in the environment
5736291 to utilize these single carbon compounds organisms employ very specialized metabolism
5736292 we suspect that in the environment there are novel versions of this metabolism and possibly completely novel pathways
5736293 it is very important for metagenomic assemblies to rely on high quality reads
5736294 the doe jgis unique integrated microbial genomics with microbiome samples img m http img jgi doe gov m data management system was used for detailed annotation and was instrumental for efficient comparative analysis and metabolic reconstruction of the samples
5736295 constitute a significant advance in the emerging discipline of metagenomics
5736296 i think other people can use the same approach in different environments as long as they have an enrichment technique
5736297 for us this work is just the beginning because now we will be using this metagenomic sequence as a scaffold for downstream experiments in our lake
5736298 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5736299 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
5736300 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5736301 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
5736302 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
5736303 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
5736304 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world
5736305 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5736306 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5736307 the negative and positive implications of wastewater agriculture have only recently received attention
5736308 this study offers the first comprehensive cross country analysis of the conditions that account for the practice and the difficult tradeoffs that arise from it
5736309 of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
5736310 and it isnt just affluent consumers of exotic vegetables whose welfare is at stake
5736311 poor consumers of inexpensive street food also depend on urban agriculture
5736312 a key aim of iwmi research is to find feasible approaches whereby wastewater irrigation can continue strengthening food security and generating economic benefits but without major health risks for urban consumers and farmers
5736313 improving the management of water and land resources for food livelihoods and nature
5736314 youve got four of the worlds best golfers in a very high class field
5736315 throw in the fact that phil is defending his first big title outside the states and trevor is going to be there as the reigning u s masters champion and you can see that it will be a tough tournament to win ive had a sixth and a fifth in the last two years so im getting closer
5736316 last year i really thought it was a great tournament and i really enjoyed visiting shanghai i love to play around the world and i am really looking forward to returning to china to play in this world class event
5736317 i am very excited to be playing the hsbc champions for the first time this year i made sure i could fit it in my schedule as it is one of the most talked about tournaments amongst the players on tour it already has a fantastic mix of players and for sure the champion of champions title is one id love to win
5736318 golf lovers in asia have come to expect the stars to come out to shanghai and were happy to be able to deliver a world class field once again winning the right to play in the hsbc champions is an achievement in itself and after lorena ochoa won the first hsbc womens champions in singapore earlier this year i think the champions title has become even more prestigious

5736547 en el congreso la derecha tiene mayor a la candidatura de lugo cont con el respaldo del partido liberal radical aut ntico plra de ideolog a de derecha y representante de terratenientes
5736548 ellos van a defender sus intereses y no van a aceptar ninguna ocupaci n de tierras ni reducci n de los latifundios
5736549 lugo est en una posici n m s de izquierda ya sali a decir que cree que las ocupaciones de tierras son leg timas como ltima instancia en la negociaci n pol tica y respalda la lucha de los campesinos por una reforma agraria integral sin embargo creemos que se va a encontrar con muchas contradicciones va a tener que asumir algunos acuerdos con la burgues a por ello el movimiento social se est preparando para apoyar las posiciones del presidente lugo y llegado el momento presionar para que se concreten los cambios
5736550 ni bien gan lugo los compa eros se organizaron y empezaron a ocupar tierras especialmente en el norte del pa s donde hay una zona muy conflictiva y donde el movimiento campesino est m s organizado e ideologizado
5736551 el an lisis realizado por nuestro movimiento es que este no es un momento estrat gico para presionar no se puede presionar al gobierno saliente que no va ofrecer garant as ni soluciones y tampoco al entrante al que hay que darle un poco de tiempo para ver si efectivamente cumple con lo que ha prometido
5736552 creo si que los compa eros en el interior est n preparados para ocupar como una medida de fuerza que me parece correcto y creo que el movimiento campesino est lo suficientemente maduro pol ticamente para tratar primero de agotar las instancias institucionales para despu s en caso de que no se cumpla con lo prometido comenzar a presionar
5736553 tambi n hay una presi n sobre todo de los medios de comunicaci n para crear en la opini n p blica una opini n desfavorable al gobierno de lugo creando temor y miedo
5736554 cuando el gobierno act e tocando intereses pol ticos fuertes la oposici n e incluso el partido liberal integrante de la coalici n de gobierno va a presionar para defender sus privilegios van a tratar de desestabilizar sectores para defender esos privilegios
5736555 y es b sicamente por eso que creo que mucho del peso pol tico que va a tener lugo depender de si puede llevar a cabo una reforma agraria integral
5736556 hay casi un mill n de empleados p blicos una clase media que vive directa o indirectamente de los recursos del estado
5736557 esas estructuras represivas siguen existiendo y lamentablemente ser dificil romperlas hoy d a los compa eros siguen siendo torturados en las c rceles del interior siguen siendo secuestrados por la polic a est n presos en situaci n ilegal siendo ocurriendo asesinatos pol ticos el a o pasado nos asesinaron a un compa ero y en lo que va de este a o han asesinados otros dos compa eros del movimiento y esto en un marco de democracia de elecciones y de libertad de expresi n
5736558 por sobre todo la acci n del nuevo gobierno estar focalizada en que los ministerios sean eficaces en sus gesti n que la salud la educaci n funcionen hay que recordar que en 61 a os en el poder el partido colorado ha creado una maquinaria impresionante de asistencial smo usando los recursos del estado en su beneficio y distribuyendo empleos p blicos y van a defender sus privilegios
5736559 espero que ojala se cumpla con lograr que los servicios del estado funcionen debidamente eso ser a un buen primer paso
5736560 en los ltimos a os el movimiento social se ha fortalecido ha logrado parar las privatizaciones la ley antiterrorista y fundamentalmente es el movimiento campesino el que m s capacidad de movilizaci n tiene creo que los compa eros del movimiento social est n conscientes de la necesidad de defender la institucionalidad en este momento
5736561 se logr acumular bastante fuerza y constituirse en el movimiento que present y apoy la candidatura de fernando lugo despu s en el trabajo se lograron acordar algunos proyectos program ticos lamentablemente en las discusiones program ticas en la coalici n fueron mimetizadas
5736562 ahora el gran desaf o es hacer un buen trabajo en los ministerios lograr una buena gesti n pero sin negligenciar el movimiento social de base que dio apoyo y crecimiento a todo esto
5736563 tomaron distancia del movimiento social concentr ndose sus cuadros en ocupar los lugares del gobierno y eso no permiti que el propio partido se dinamice
5736564 el gran desaf o seguir creciendo con la base seguir formando y construyendo el poder popular que es lo nico que nos va a garantizar un movimiento social ideologizado que nos va a permitir en el futuro y creo que es v lido para toda am rica latina poner freno a pol ticas neoliberales capitalistas para mi la nica forma concretar un cambio social estructural es constuyendo el poder popular
5736565 estamos ac para seguir avanzando en la recuperaci n de nuestros recursos nacionalizaci n de las empresas
5736566 si me ratifican con m s de un 54 voy a convocar a todas las autoridades para buscar consensos y que el pueblo pueda aprobar una constituci n pol tica del estado boliviano que es un tema pendiente
5736567 el triunfo de la revoluci n democr tica de bolivia y del pueblo boliviano est dedicado a todos los pueblos revolucionarios de latinoam rica y el mundo
5736568 por primera vez en esta historia del pueblo boliviano hubo un referendo revocatorio y cont con la participaci n masiva de todo nuestro pueblo
5736569 no solo elige a sus candidatos adem s de eso los ratifica o los revoca
5736570 estamos ac para seguir avanzando en la recuperaci n de nuestros recursos nacionalizaci n de las empresas fundamental en la retoma de las empresas del estado
5736571 la participaci n que hoy se vio es para unir a los distintos sectores campo y ciudad y esa unidad se har juntando la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado con los estatutos auton micos respetando las normas existentes
5736572 pese a la alianza de la derecha fascista racista y algunos medios de comunicaci n
5736573 m s del 90 por ciento de los medios est n contra el proceso de cambio por lo tanto contra el pueblo esos periodistas est n contra m s del 65 por ciento de bolivianas y bolivianos que le dicen s al cambio
5736574 este gobierno insensible totalitario masista incapaz le niega el desarrollo al pueblo y s lo busca concentrar el poder y convertirnos en mendigo de l sigue siendo un pretexto de la dictadura masista el atender a los ancianos con el idh la verdadera intenci n es destruir la autonom a departamental
5736575 porque eso es autonom a democracia participativa real y es una forma de llevar el poder de decisi n a la gente
5736576 estamos impulsando la creaci n de la agencia tributaria departamental para contar con una entidad que defienda nuestros recursos de forma eficiente y transparente que permitir la ejecuci n de un fondo solidario de apoyo a otros departamentos
5736577 lo confiscado por el neopopulismo masista debe ser recuperado y eso no se negocia

5736580 estas leyes promulgadas est n apegadas a la constituci n
5736581 el jefe de estado s est facultado para dictar leyes org nicas cumpliendo el requerimiento de enviarlas a la sala constitucional del tribunal supremo de justicia tsj
5736582 en 2007 se publicaron 20 leyes muchas de stas a la espera de la propuesta de reforma constitucional que al no darse se tuvieron que reformular las legislaciones de manera que se mantuvieran dentro del texto constitucional vigente
5736583 estuve tentado a titular este art culo de manera distinta por ejemplo
5736584 en venezuela en mi punto de vista vivimos cambios intensos mas no una revoluci n todav a hay muchas cosas del pasado mucho lastre que no logramos superar la trama heredada opera como controlador del proceso y tardar tiempo para que sus logros se perciban con nitidez y se consoliden pero estamos viviendo tiempos de cambio estos se est n dando y quiz sea ste el rasgo m s significativo en libertad y en democracia con arreglo al estado de derecho consagrado en la constituci n de 1999
5736585 esos cambios tropiezan a cada instante con poderosos obst culos obst culos que colocan en el camino grupos econ micos poderes transnacionales viejos h bitos pol ticos y en general un pasado cargado de negatividad de revanchismo y la voluntad de garantizarse a como d lugar que las cosas sigan siendo como eran
5736586 la facultad del parlamento de habilitar al jefe del estado para dictar decretos con fuerza de ley siempre estuvo consagrada en el ordenamiento constitucional venezolano y la ejercieron los gobiernos en diferentes etapas de nuestra historia no es una novedad y menos a n un golpe de estado o una violaci n de la carta magna como algunos lo plantean
5736587 lo que sucede es que ahora se legisla con otro signo con otra orientaci n pero los 26 decretos leyes aprobados por ch vez en el marco de la habilitaci n que le otorg la asamblea nacional son inobjetables la otorg con la mayor a requerida la representaci n popular y la ejerce un presidente electo por el pueblo
5736588 va en el mismo dise o de los proyectos de 2001 con las leyes habilitantes que estaban destinadas a una mayor injerencia del estado y adem s lesionar la propiedad privada
5736589 aqu el problema no es el control del estado de las instituciones es la confiscaci n la ocupaci n de los espacios sociales y por eso se habla de un neototalitarismo que es distinto a la dictadura pol tica
5736590 que el mandatario venezolano tras decretar la semana pasada leyes que fueron rechazadas en el referendo de 2007 sobre una reforma constitucional inici nuevos pasos para implementar el socialismo en el pa s y lograr la reelecci n continua
5736591 el presidente de la rep blica con la participaci n del tribunal supremo de justicia han desconocido la constituci n vigente han pisoteado el estado de derecho han impedido el derecho a la participaci n han aplicado una sistem tica estrategia de desinformaci n han actuado de manera arbitraria ilegal y contra el inter s y la opini n del pa s
5736592 26 leyes que el gobierno aprob en las ltimas horas aprueban las mismas cosas y peores a las que el pueblo venezolano dijo no el 2 de diciembre

5736594 esta ha sido una negociaci n entre dos aliados y amigos cercanos y a pesar de que han habido altibajos naturalmente a lo largo de todo el proceso nos gratifica que ambas delegaciones hayan tratado esto en el esp ritu de intentar hacer algo que es importante para la seguridad de ambos pa ses y como aliados y amigos
5736595 lo que suceda en los pr ximos d as y meses determinar el futuro de las relaciones entre estados unidos y rusia pero del mismo modo mi opini n personal es que tienen que haber consecuencias para las acciones que rusia ha tomado contra un estado soberano
5736596 acuso al gobierno ruso de adoptar una pol tica de limpieza tnica y puedo probarlo con organizaciones internacionales que ya est n dando testimonio de lo que digo y recibimos 1 400 denuncias de ataques brutales asesinatos violaciones e internaci n de personas en violaci n de la convenci n de ginebra y del derecho humanitario internacional
5736597 como ya he dicho de acuerdo con el c digo de las naciones unidas estamos intentando imponer la paz a georgia que empez la agresi n consideramos que esta t ctica es muy efectiva y es la nica posible perm tanme recordarles que en la historia hemos visto muchos ejemplos de pacificaci n del agresor de esta manera los pa ses occidentales lo hicieron hace 70 a os y conocen las tr gicas consecuencias de eso quiero decir la lecci n del tratado de munich de 1938
5736598 rusia invadi un estado vecino soberano y amenaza a un gobierno democr tico electo por su pueblo
5736599 entendemos que el actual liderazgo de georgia es un proyecto especial de estados unidos pero un d a estados unidos tendr que elegir entre defender su prestigio por sobre un proyecto o una sociedad real que requiera acciones conjuntas
5736600 quiero dialogar con los rusos quiero que se retiren del territorio georgiano lo m s r pido posible y me interesa mantener buenas relaciones con rusia pero en el siglo xxi las naciones no invaden otras naciones
5736601 estamos sumamente decepcionados este informe aparentemente consiente el uso de la fuerza letal en una situaci n en la que los soldados no pod an y lo admiten estar seguros de lo que ten an frente creemos que hab a fundamentos suficientes para que se dieran cuenta que estaban frente a periodistas esto nos pone en una posici n en la que los periodistas no pueden levantar una c mara en presencia de los soldados israel es sin correr peligro de que les disparen eso es inaceptable y hablaremos con las autoridades israel es sobre c mo podemos mejorar la seguridad de nuestros periodistas en el futuro
5736602 el informe israel sobre el asesinato de fadel ha suscitado temores entre los periodistas palestinos que cubren el conflicto con israel en gaza entre los palestinos y los israel es en la franja de gaza sobre la misi n ustedes saben la misi n de cubrir y filmar y hemos estado escuchando comentarios de todos los otros colegas de que ya no est n seguros de sus vidas tras un informe como este que deja en claro que el simple hecho de levantar una c mara en la calle en un campo de refugiados o cerca de la frontera puede poner la vida de una persona en peligro
5736603 en este incidente del 16 de abril seis civiles fueron asesinados con proyectiles tipo flechette un arma ilegal que no deber a ser utilizada en estas condiciones en la franja de gaza y una de estas seis v ctimas era un periodista por todas estas razones era de esperarse que el ej rcito iniciara y dirigiera una investigaci n minuciosa sobre este caso pero decidi no hacerlo la falta de responsabilidad en este caso se refleja en la falta de responsabilidad en la muerte de miles de palestinos que fueron asesinados en los territorios ocupados

5736609 origin has developed a leading position in coal seam gas in australia and the strength of this position will be a key driver for continuing growth
5736610 origin has outstanding prospects as a strongly performing australian integrated energy company with increasing exposure to growing demand and higher prices for australias natural resources
5736611 directors believe it is in shareholders best interests to reject bgs bid
5736612 whilst equity markets and energy prices decline and coal seam gas companies share prices fall origin is telling its shareholders to wait for an uncertain and unclear outcome from its monetisation process and reject the certain value of bg groups a 15 50 7 22 all cash offer
5736613 theres a sense that origin has gotten quite a positive response on its coal seam gas monetisation process but thats still in early days so its hard to decide which is a better option
5736614 theres a high chance they will wait until they get more details of the coal seam gas monetisation proposals origin has received but they could also make a pre emptive strike and launch a higher offer

5736691 i just want to thank the coaching staff for going out on a limb for me and understanding the circumstances i have been in and obstacles i have had to go through

5736693 i appreciate his hard work while he has been here getting his academics in order i also appreciate the work of our compliance staff and the southeastern conference and the wisdom of the ncaa staff of approving this for a quality young man the whole system is about helping student athletes be successful and its good to see they are making that happen
5736694 we began sponsoring the north korean olympic team last year as north korea is an old friend of china
5736695 its a good opportunity for us as we want to become an international specialist sports brand we need to experience major events like the olympics
5736696 maybe it is different in the west but we have had no negative feedback from customers in china
5736697 its very rare that chinese customers comment on political matters so nobody would protest about our sponsorship
5736698 i felt a bit disappointed they did not wear our clothes at the opening ceremony
5736699 but many other countries also didnt wear their sponsors clothes
5736700 we want to participate in the olympics show our athletic spirit and spread our reputation in china and the rest of the world
5736701 chinese people know it is very chaotic there and they sympathize with the iraqis it is a country at war and even managing to attend the games will be an encouragement for them
5736702 we sponsor the sudanese track and field team we do not sponsor the sudanese government
5736703 we found the team through an american agent as we were looking for a good african team for our running products we never put politics human rights and sports together we are a sports company not a government body
5736704 no one in china has ever complained about this the chinese know to keep politics and sports separate
5736705 the concept of creating a balanced society in world of zellians is truly engaging and challenging and we are designing this experience to be fun and accessible for all audiences from casual to core gamers
5736706 as the ruler of this society players will be responsible for developing the community as well as providing a positive influence in the world creating a very challenging and interactive gaming experience
5736707 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
5736708 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
5736709 all the evidence so far indicates that these qualitative differences in nutrition are causal in determining caste though were missing the final link in order to determine if it was casual
5736710 there are some cases where nature completely wins out but all of this is telling us theres a nice interaction between nature and nurture across most social insects
5736711 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5736712 the eu committed to bind and eliminate duties on ita products in its wto tariff schedules we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5736713 impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers
5736714 you see guys with his talent level you see guys with his work ethic but you dont see many with an olympic gold medal

5736716 currently the experience is pretty crappy you have to click through an infobar to allow installation of this component then you have to click yes to say that you really want to run the native content and then you have to click yes again to allow the component to interact with content on the page
5736717 in theory with the right signatures the right security class implementations some eye of newt and a pinch of garlic its possible to get things down to a one time install which would make the component available everywhere

5736720 john mccain says you have to get the big things right but time and time again he gets the big things wrong on the biggest national security question we have faced the war in iraq senator mccain turned in the wrong answer with americans struggling to afford energy costs senator mccain found time to visit an oil rig today but couldnt find the time to cast the deciding vote on critical renewable energy legislation now he faces another big decision will senator mccain choose a running mate who made the right choices on iraq and our nations energy policy or will he choose another republican who keeps getting the big things wrong
5736721 well mccain is a loser but hes not that big of a loser
5736722 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
5736723 the world is full of light and life and the true crime is not to be interested in it
5736724 when the front of the brain fires you want to see the back of the brain fire right back
5736725 unfortunately this connection seems to weaken with age so that older people can end up with a rather disconnected brain
5736726 and this variation was evident both in the brain and in observed behavior
5736727 the fedora infrastructure team is currently investigating an issue in the infrastructure systems
5736728 that process may result in service outages for which we apologize in advance were still assessing the end user impact of the situation but as a precaution we recommend you not download or update any additional packages on your fedora systems
5736729 we know the community is awaiting more detail on the past weeks activities and their causes were preparing a timeline and details and will make them available in the near future we appreciate the communitys patience and will continue to post updates to the fedora announce list as soon as possible
5736730 it was a murder with intention he murdered her in anger because she refused to part with the gadget
5736731 we were always worried about students bringing such gadgets to the school
5736732 we have issued several notices and given enough warnings asking them not to bring ipods and cell phones to class
5736733 world oil reserves have probably peaked yesterday today or tomorrow literally right about now
5736734 production worldwide will start declining relatively soon we are right at that point
5736735 rest assured that for nearly 100 years people have been looking for super large oil finds so it is not too likely there will be more of those
5736736 we have had booms and busts in the oil industry for almost a century with each one getting a little bigger the last bust was in 1980
5736737 as long as crude oil was inexpensive it was hard to beat
5736738 it is like water generated electricity put up a dam and let water turn turbines when other sources of energy are not readily available the price of oil goes up lots of alternative fuels are feasible financially now only because of the current high cost of oil but technology has not been put in place to take advantage of that situation and rapidly move forward with alternative methods almost anything we can do in this country for large scale energy production will take five to ten years to start delivery on a large scale
5736739 just because we conserve wont cause the price of oil to magically change because there is increasing world demand
5736740 conserving could help stabilize what is going on but it is not going to cause a decrease in the cost of oil
5736741 clean coal technology is tremendously better but we arent there yet
5736742 we arent ready it is going to take minimum of fivers sic 10 years for clean coal technologies to start helping the situation it is now economically feasible because of oil prices when it wasnt five years ago economics plays a big part but we needed more proactiveness to it to be ready for what was coming i blame politicians for sticking their heads in the sand for the past 25 years
5736743 could be one of the cheapest forms of power out there
5736744 we are continually looking at ways to improve our website on behalf of our customers and regularly ask for feedback and comments on how they feel it could be improved for their benefit we consider all ideas put forward and wherever possible we endeavor to meet and exceed our customers expectations we are very pleased on this occasion to be able to fufiil our customers requirements by providing them with the full range of product specification sheets from the excel range
5736745 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5736746 you dont pass that sort of legislation unless theres some sort of intent to use it
5736747 were certainly poised and ready when market conditions are appropriate
5736748 continues to exceed our regulatory capital requirements we continue to provide stability and liquidity to the housing market and we will continue to play a key role as the market recovers from this cycle
5736749 let saakashvili go to hell its thanks to him were in this pickle
5736750 we went to the council house to get emergency aid but there was nothing the russians treat us better than our own government at least they hand out cigarettes
5736751 yes the russians are still here i dont know how much longer they are totally exploiting the situation theyre making us negotiate for every square centimetre theyve occupied theyre trying to destroy our military infrastructure and our economy
5736752 our aim was to block the roki tunnel between russian and south ossetia for some time it had been the route of illegal support for the separatists we thought that after we had done that we would be able to negotiate with the russians
5736753 i was hoping russia would immediately be expelled from the g 8 that sanctions would be imposed visa restrictions you name it
5736754 admits the security advisor despite pressure from the united states and others not to respond to provocation lomaia continued on his path
5736755 we wanted to act as a sovereign state not as some western bloc country
5736756 islamic terror cell may have been plotting to attack queen
5736757 then with his sandal the guard drew a cross in the dirt
5736758 we stood wordlessly there for a minute or two venerating the cross until the guard rubbed it out and walked away to me that was faith a faith that unites and never divides a faith that bridges unbridgeable gaps in humanity it is the faith that we are all equal and endowed by our creator with inalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it is the faith i would die to defend
5736759 theres nobody down there in dire straits because they dont have any food or water right now
5736760 we believe we got all the tourists and all the hikers out of there
5736761 it gives you a real impression of the force of mother nature when she shows her strength
5736762 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5736763 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5736764 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5736765 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out
5736766 it was so negligent so badly handled not only by the villagers but also by whatever agency was there that i will never go back to that place
5736767 its beautiful i would have loved to go back there
5736768 we still have judges that engage in ex parte contact or personal behavior thats not up to snuff
5736769 thats going to happen in any system but i think increased training is the way to address demeanor behavior and judicial issues
5736770 we went into counties where everything was on file cards and indictments shoved in the back drawers
5736771 i set out to rebuild an application in one week that had been developed over the last seven years in c by generations of post docs
5736772 im currently writing a realtime data acquisition display application im using enthought tool suite and traits and chaco for display imho i think that in five years ets traits will be the most comonly used framework for scientific applications

5736790 three anti aging treatments are proven clinically effective the topical application of retinol carbon dioxide laser resurfacing and injection of hyaluronic acid a moisture retaining acid that occurs naturally in the skin
5736791 skin creams with retinol are available over the counter but many do not indicate the concentration of the active ingredient many products just refer to retinol or vitamin a as a buzzword said gary j fisher the lead author of the review and a professor of dermatology at the university of michigan
5736792 the laser removes thin layers of skin without damaging surrounding tissue as the wound heals new collagen is produced
5736793 the authors cite studies that have demonstrated that increased collagen production is visible within a month after the injection the benefit lasts about six months dr fisher said
5736794 the sfa usually claim they make exchanges in favour of the state without knowing what the woodland would be used for but in this case they have no reason to say that because it had made the order for the creation of new land plots itself which had clear characteristics for ski routes and lifts

5736800 it came in through all three doors that i have
5736801 account executives are good at a lot of things but none of them is advertising
5736802 im angry so much that i want to get revenge
5736803 its just like living in iraq terrorist town thats how i see it bunch of terrorists here
5736804 these types of cowardly acts are hideous and there are a lot of community members that are fed up with it
5736805 people are saying what can we do to make it right
5736806 it is up to us the four nations people we need to work together to come up with long term solutions against the gangs the drugs and the violence but our community has to take charge
5736807 beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror which we are still just able to endure and we are so awed because it serenely disdains to annihilate us every angel is terrifying
5736808 and let me tell you now why wings and doors and flowers really open why this wall once non negotiable had let you in it is because all things want to open that often all you need do is ask so that when desperate and despairing you had said please the hard heart of the stone melted quickly without much enchantment naturally generous simply pleased
5736809 orions belt remote and unused why not something more solid a buckle glinting in the half dark its erratic arc slicing the atmosphere the orbit of pain all the aching stretches of the universe and the childs body yielding upon impact
5736810 he doesnt understand fear the fireflies have drawn him out the evening a terrible creature of jewels and gems the house retreats farther and farther back broken tamed
5736811 and if i come closer i will hear his heart pounding fiercely keeping wild rhythms child breaking into light but listen we must let go of these things i keep back and let the child be broken tamed
5736812 i would say the message is we were disappointed with our performance at e3
5736813 we were excited that mr miyamoto made the commitment that pikmin is coming it would have been nice if we could have said that on stage but we think it was a good recognition for us that we care for our core fans and not just the new people who are now discovering nintendo
5736814 have some damn pride in your best work and give it some of the spotlight next time nintendo
5736815 im the leader so im keeping the party together and i use my abilities to initiate a cool plan we can get across this bridge if i teleport the rogue across the bridge so he can take down that wizard
5736816 were going to take this guy in this role and push him to somewhere else
5736817 earlier i did this and this is the result i got
5736818 well we know what the destination is were taking a slightly different route to get there
5736819 heres the fighter class heres a bunch of fighter powers that make you feel like a leader or controller
5736820 the swordmage can spend a standard action to attack everyone around him and the fighter cant do that
5736821 now that ive attacked you you dont want to shift or attack someone else
5736822 wow this guy can attack everything around it we need to make everything else weak
5736823 we could see making this a new role but this guy is two steps away from this existing role
5736824 this guy has a slow effect so we react like this
5736825 we can spread out to avoid this but if we do he has this wall and he can trap the wizard along the corner
5736826 hey that game that you played and we supported for eight years sucks
5736827 hey youve got an xbox or ps2 heres why you want a wii
5736828 heres how it worked then and heres how it works now
5736829 it has to be compelling because this game is good
5736830 the grand prixs image is one part swoopy styling and one part performance
5736831 the grand prixs dash is playful with overlapping folds large round air vents and prominent red lighting
5736832 puts up impressive performance numbers despite a clear lack of refinement
5736833 putting 303 horsepower through the front wheels doesnt make it a great car just a quick one
5736834 it accelerates from a standstill with vigor and the v 8 emits a much throatier fuller exhaust note than the discontinued supercharged v 6
5736835 helps deliver highway fuel economy figures better than some v6s
5736836 the amount of usable power doesnt make this car scream for a 5 or 6 speed automatic but it sure wouldnt be bad for fuel economy numbers
5736837 body roll was also conspicuous in transitions accompanied by resolute understeer
5736838 but it gives the impression of avoiding rather than absorbing them
5736839 g numbers and magnetic steering stand in for sensitivity to the finer points of chassis tuning
5736840 chassis lacks suppleness its steering lacks linearity and its brakes lack bite
5736841 big car on the outside but smallish on the inside
5736842 ample legroom up front but no excess of headroom particularly with the available sunroof the seats provide good side support in turns
5736843 front riders are treated to wide bucket seats with gentle bolsters
5736844 low rear seat bottom cushions had our taller passengers riding with their knees uncomfortably high
5736845 rear seat comfort is disappointing for a vehicle this size
5736846 has the look of melted air traffic control consoles and screams cheapness
5736847 the quality of the plastics used inside the grand prix and the overall design layout are not up to the standards set by the dodge charger
5736848 the potent gxp is worth a look for shoppers who put a premium on power and expressive styling
5736849 v6 powered models also stack up well when compared to rivals from mazda
5736850 a double take because i expected the gxp to be priced much higher than what it is
5736851 traction control is optional on the base model and come s standard on the gxp
5736852 the system is less intrusive than the related stabilitrak offered on cadillac models enabling spirited driving with gentle corrections
5736853 allows the driver to extinguish all instrument panel lighting for enhanced visibility during night driving
5736854 youll find the optional head up display hud almost subliminal in its presence
5736855 displacement on demand enable s up to 12 percent improved fuel economy
5736856 9 5 foot space easily large enough to bring home 2x4s or a ladder from the hardware store
5736857 swing out 82 degrees improving ingress and egress for people and stuff
5736858 this may just be the best steering wheel mounted paddle shifter yet allowing the palm and fingers to remain on to the steering wheel in their normal position while the thumbs do all of the gear changes
5736859 its not hard to max out the capabilities of the base system if you really like to blast music
5736860 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5736861 this track cycling event consists of a single race this race is a 50 kilometre 200 lap race cyclists compete in pairs with one resting as the other rides placing was determined first by laps then by points points were awarded based on intermediate sprints held every 20 laps the first finisher in each sprint earns 5 points the second gets 3 the third finisher earns 2 and the fourth place cyclist after each sprint gets 1 point
5736862 this darkness has descended and yet there has been no declaration of national emergency
5736863 you look like some fat bloke who swallowed matthew pinsent
5736864 people of religious innovation and misguidance those who abandon the sunnah of the messenger of allah pbuh and advocate other beliefs
5736865 we arab muslims are the most affected by the grave consequences of hostile attack on man and life we share the suffering experienced by innocent palestinians at the hands of the tyrannical jewish entity
5736866 it should be made clear that defense against unprovoked aggression and resistance to reduce oppression are legitimate causes for combative jihad provided that all other conditions qualifiers and ethics of war are strictly observed
5736867 the public to help the police to fight the inclinations towards the murder of physically challenged persons for superstitious reasons
5736868 over the course of the next five years gold could fall farther than you think and then soar higher than you can imagine
5736869 expands the potential of traditional geothermal energy by orders of magnitude
5736870 the people were funding today have a real shot at lowering the cost of egs and bringing us closer to our goal of renewable energy cheaper than coal
5736871 egs could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
5736872 egs is critical to the clean electricity revolution we need to solve the climate crisis but egs hasnt received the attention it merits thats why were pressing for expanded support from government and increased investment from the private sector were big believers in egs and were looking for more opportunities
5736873 road travel is in decline mass transit ridership is at all time highs gasoline sales are down and auto sales are at a multi year low
5736874 the weak economic outlook from the u s britain the eu japan korea and even slower growth in china are cutting into demand and putting downward pressure on oil
5736875 there will likely be a little recovery in u s demand from lower prices but not enough to put much pressure on prices economic news should be the dominant factor for the coming months
5736876 iran tests a missile capable of reaching orbit and who knows where else and oil is still down if that happened two months ago we would have had a 5 spike but two months back almost anything was good for a 5 spike

5736881 pretty well everyone is sold out of stock there we have seen premiums as high as 2 50 an ounce which is unheard of in india most refiners are now booked solid through september said a senior figure at a bullion bank in london

5736897 sir lancelot ik groet u uit naam van koning pelleas en ook verzoek ik u met mij naar een woud hier vlakbij te komen
5736898 hij zal morgen v r het avondmaal bij u terug zijn
5736899 dat hij morgen niet bij ons zou zijn zou hij niet met mijn instemming vertrekken
5736900 welk avontuur heeft u hier gebracht wij meenden u morgen te vinden op camelot
5736901 wij brengen u dit kind hier dat wij hebben opgevoed en wij smeken u hem tot ridder te slaan want uit een waardiger hand kan hij de orde der ridderschap niet ontvangen
5736902 zal hij de orde der ridderschap ontvangen ter ere van het hoogfeest
5736903 moge god u een goed man maken want aan schoonheid ontbreekt het u zomin als wie ook die thans leeft nu waarde heer
5736904 wilt u met mij naar het hof van koning arthur komen
5736905 vierhonderd en vierenvijftig jaren zullen zijn verstreken na de passie van onze here jezus christus als deze zetel bezet zal worden
5736906 dat deze zetel vandaag nog vervuld moet worden want dit is pinksteren na het vierhonderdvierenvijftigste jaar en als iedereen het daarmee eens is zou ik willen dat deze letters vandaag niet meer te zien zijn tot hij komt voor wie dit avontuur bestemd is
5736907 als u nu aan de maaltijd gaat breekt u met de oude gewoonte van uw hof want u was niet gewoon om aan de maaltijd te gaan voor u enig avontuur had gezien
5736908 maar ik was zo blij dat sir lancelot en zijn neven gezond en wel naar het hof zijn gekomen dat ik aan geen enkel oud gebruik heb gedacht
5736909 sir beneden bij de rivier is een grote steen als van rood marmer die ik op het water zag drijven en daarin zag ik een zwaard gestoken
5736910 niemand zal mij hier wegnemen dan hij aan wiens zijde ik hoor te hangen en hij zal de beste ridder van de wereld zijn
5736911 waarde heer dit zwaard moet voor u zijn want ik weet zeker dat u de beste ridder van de wereld bent
5736912 sir het is mijn zwaard niet ook heb ik niet de moed mijn hand ernaar uit te strekken want het hoort niet aan mijn zijde te hangen bovendien zal degene die probeert dat zwaard te nemen en faalt door dat zwaard een wond krijgen waarvan hij lange tijd niet zal genezen en u moet ook weten dat vandaag nog het avontuur van de heilige graal zal beginnen die het gewijde vat wordt genoemd
5736913 probeert u dat zwaard te nemen voor mij en op mijn bevel
5736914 weet wel dat dit zwaard u nu zo smartelijk zal treffen dat u wilde dat u het nog niet had aangeraakt voor het beste kasteel in dit rijk
5736915 our position is that we cant recommend the players tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5736916 obviously we put a position forward a few weeks ago to the icc to that effect but we said we would keep an open mind with the taskforce which we did
5736917 we heard them speak on friday now we have had a chance to digest it all our position hasnt changed
5736918 that 15 million bale export forecast gives us some cause for hope
5736919 even if we dont get to 15 million in exports it leaves us in the situation where we may see a tightening of the balance sheet for u s cotton
5736920 any number between 5 2 million and 7 1 million bales is still better than 10 million bales
5736921 the decline in world cotton production in 2008 09 is attributable mainly to the lower forecast for the united states as this crop is projected 28 percent below 2007 08
5736922 chinas crop is forecast only slightly below that of a year ago while the rest of the world of the world is forecast to fall 2 percent to the lowest since 2003 04
5736923 the u s share of global production is estimated lower at 12 percent in 2008 09 compared with the five year average of 18 5 percent
5736924 input costs for cotton are still high relative to other crops
5736925 the concern now is that when you look at these prices we could still be in a situation where we are still trying to hold on to cotton acres at best we may be holding on but we could possibly lose more acres in 2009
5736926 it may well be that consumers have to curtail clothing purchases because of higher gasoline prices
5736927 if you look at the august crop report over the last five years the crop gets bigger by from 1 million to 3 million bales between august and december
5736928 cotton still appears to be the better alternative because of the sharp increase in indias cotton yields
5736929 the key to the world production and price outlooks may be whether a shift will occur in brazil brazilian farmers are expected to plant more soybeans because of exchange problems and the higher prices offered for soybeans
5736930 while the long term outlook for the cotton sector in the united states is favorable the sector may still endure some pain
5736931 food and fiber compose the largest sector in the georgia economy
5736932 we have an abundance of food to eat and clothes to wear these are such basic needs and we dont notice that in our economy
5736933 fiber involves a product as it leaves the farm or forest and taking it to a certain point of the manufacturing process
5736934 since food and fiber industries are such a large component of the georgia economy programs in the college of agricultural and environmental sciences and the college of family and consumer sciences have great impacts on the state economy
5736935 economic importance of food and fiber in the georgia economy
5736936 in keeping with expectations weve been hearing about lower demand and economic slowdowns
5736937 which suggest very little chance of counter cyclical payments or government payments based on the adjusted world price kicking in
5736938 even though the export target wasnt met the carry in is going to rise for 2008 09
5736939 on average over the last 10 years usdas august projection was off about 8 percent from final estimates
5736940 recent history suggests we could swing this crop by 1 1 million bales on either side of the current forecast of 13 77 million bales any way you slice it though were going to come out with lower ending stocks for 2008 09 so there is a stronger rationale there for stronger prices
5736941 we couldnt see any more than 2 7 million bales from this 41 county area
5736942 would depend on continued timely rainfall over the next several weeks coupled with ideal growing conditions and a late fall to make sure the late planted crop is maximized experience tells us this is very unlikely we believe this is a small crop and will only get smaller from usdas 3 7 million bale estimate
5736943 basically much of the area dedicated to cotton is irrigated its very good cotton soil so its very forgiving of problems that occur early in the year
5736944 might try to take december back below 69 cents if we do i think it will be only marginally below down to 68 cents i dont think it will stay there long i tend to think prices will move back up into the low 70s i dont think well get to 74 cents until we get a better idea of this crop size well still have 51 million bales of cotton around the world next year thats still a big carryover
5736945 i think we have a couple more months before the tightness of 2009 becomes apparent im positive longer term in the next two to three years that acreage in china and india is going to be dedicated to food crops as opposed to fiber which should increase the price of cotton
5736946 gives a little bit more back to the fans it gives them more options and ways of getting more from us

5736990 as well as using a racial slur directed towards ramirez
5736991 its been a really hard day for me and im just really happy that the charges stuck
5736992 i bought a bike from honda at the start of the year and it was delivered to glenn here in mittagong
5736993 we talked about doing some races all the talk started about doing the finke and glenn said if you are going to do that you may as well do the condo and safari as well
5736994 its almost on us theres no backing out now glenn has promised it will be an experience but i dont know if it is going to be a good experience or a bad one
5736995 he said he was sick of reading about it and decided to have a go
5736996 hes getting better and better purely to finish will be an achievement
5736997 ill give it as good a shot as i can ill be glad to finish i dont know where that will be ill just have a crack there will be a few in front of me but hopefully there will be a few behind me too
5736998 im out of contract and there has been so much talk about how the club is going with a youth policy i understand that so from my point of view ive got to look at it as though these could be my last two games with melbourne
5736999 im really keen to play at another club next year if it goes that way my preference would be to stay at melbourne but with the youth policy i figure that might not happen
5737000 i think its pretty evident to everyone out there but its just a matter of what they want to decide at the end of the day ill enjoy my footy over the next two weeks and then see what happens i just want to play
5737001 i reckon ive got at least another one or two years left in me
5737002 this year including games with sandy vfl affiliate sandringham ive averaged the most possessions ive had in my career
5737003 my bodys fine i love training i love preparing my body ive got a lot of motivation and i love playing footy
5737004 i played 100 games straight and missed the game against hawthorn with a back problem
5737005 apart from getting dropped ive played every game with sandy i feel like ive still got a lot in me and i can offer a lot
5737006 theres no animosity towards melbourne whatsoever theyve been a great club and i love them to death but i want to play on
5737007 and if its not going to be with the red and blue i want to go somewhere else
5737008 ive been working with the younger guys and i enjoy doing that sort of stuff its something jimmy stynes did for me when i first came to the club and later with sam newman
5737009 i really fed off the information i got from those two and earlier from a guy named percy johnson in perth
5737010 the teachings ive had id love to give to someone else whether its at melbourne or another club
5737011 if another club doesnt pick me up and it happens to be the end then i would love to help out next year but my first preference is to play next year
5737012 i think kp needs to concentrate on beating south africa first rather than worrying about the ashes
5737013 if anybody is thinking about the ashes in my opinion they are thinking way too far ahead its going to be an interesting time in pietersens career to see how he goes as captain
5737014 i think the one thing i want to make clear at the camp is we have some really tough cricket coming up before england next year
5737015 we have three massive test series in the next year
5737016 i think all three india in india south africa home and away and england in england are going to be as hard as each other its about adapting because all three are completely different conditions
5737017 all our planning for the next 12 months will come from the camp
5737018 i think brebners got a real good chance of being involved this week
5737019 its probably unlikely hell start but i think theres a good chance brebner will get on the pitch at some stage
5737020 in 10 or 12 years ive never faced anything like this and there were times when i thought if it was worth it
5737021 it was hard but thankfully now im towards the other side of it
5737022 im on the training pitch and if youre on the training pitch theres always a chance of playing im desperate to play but whether coach ernie merrick thinks im ready yet i dont know
5737023 theres no getting away from it its going to be hard
5737024 its been really hard getting back to training fitness never mind game fitness and its just pushing the body but not pushing the body enough that you break down again
5737025 im still not 100 per cent but im getting there

5737030 can safely say this is the one place i never in my life thought i would be
5737031 of course mccain promised he would bring u s troops home in victory not defeat and thanked the vets for their service a natural crowd pleaser for this audience
5737032 were typecast as this principled political band but the first impulse for being a band and continuing to be a band is the music we go into the rehearsal room to make new songs and we feel like we redefine the band every time thats exciting so how we measure success isnt about whether we have hits or were famous or accepted by the right people but about whether the music moves us
5737033 wed been listening to ethiopian music for years and terrie and i went over a few years ago because we wanted to make a plan to play there
5737034 we found a really old cassette of getatchews music in a market and we contacted him through his label and invited him to play with us at our 25th anniversary show four years ago it was fantastic he told a friend i want to play with the ex band it was his idea to get together and record it was a different tradition than he was used to but he loved the energy we have
5737035 its very hypnotic and it shares some similarities with rasta and asian music
5737036 its sweet but theres something snaky about the rhythms we feel at home playing this music because without realizing it we have a similar approach we create simple parts that interlock and build up to become quite complex and rich which is similar to the way ethiopian music works
5737037 he couldnt speak english with us so we did the whole thing in this kind of sign language laughing very vague body gestures but it somehow worked
5737038 he reminds me of some of the blues guys who resurfaced in the 60s
5737039 they disappeared after the depression and then they would reappear at carnegie hall its not quite the same for gatatchew but its great that he gets this second chance to play he enjoys the fact that people at this late stage of his life appreciate his music it must be incredible to be 73 years old from ethiopia and discover that there are tens of thousands of people in a field in england who love your music

5737159 in the past of utopia in the age of confusion
5737160 on earth we tame our animals with hot irons and our fellow men by violence and fraud
5737161 you cannot imagine how beaten and fearful even decent people are upon earth you learn of the age of confusion in your histories but you do not know what the realities of a bad mental atmosphere an atmosphere of feeble laws hates and superstitions are as night goes round the earth always there are hundreds of thousands of people who should be sleeping lying awake fearing a bully fearing a cruel competition dreading lest they cannot make good ill of some illness they cannot comprehend distressed by some irrational quarrel maddened by some thwarted instinct or some suppressed and perverted desire
5737162 much of the every day misery of earth was now inconceivable very slowly utopia had evolved its present harmony of law and custom and education man was no longer crippled and compelled it was recognized that he was fundamentally an animal and that his daily life must follow the round of appetites satisfied and instincts released the daily texture of utopian life was woven of various and interesting foods and drinks of free and entertaining exercise and work of sweet sleep and of the interest and happiness of fearless and spiteless love making inhibition was at a minimum but where the power of utopian education began was after the animal had been satisfied and disposed of the jewel on the reptiles head that had brought utopia out of the confusions of human life was curiosity the play impulse prolonged and expanded in adult life into an insatiable appetite for knowledge and an habitual creative urgency all utopians had become as little children learners and makers
5737163 nature is the material world when we look upon it we see that it is dark and imperfect for instance if we allow a piece of land to remain in its natural condition we will find it covered with thorns and thistles useless weeds and wild vegetation will flourish upon it and it will become like a jungle the trees will be fruitless lacking beauty and symmetry wild animals noxious insects and reptiles will abound in its dark recesses this is the incompleteness and imperfection of the world of nature to change these conditions we must clear the ground and cultivate it so that flowers may grow instead of thorns and weeds that is to say we must illumine the dark world of nature in their primal natural state the forests are dim gloomy and impenetrable man opens them to the light clears away the tangled underbrush and plants fruitful trees soon the wild woodlands and jungle are changed into productive orchards and beautiful gardens order has replaced chaos the dark realm of nature has become illumined and brightened by cultivation

5737184 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5737185 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home

5737204 he went on to explain that he has played on an over 50 senior baseball league for years and that he is one of the top pitchers in his age group in the country
5737205 shes nervous but shes equally as excited about being over here in the new school
5737206 and i like that its so close to home i feel like the school is just around the corner
5737207 it makes me a little nervous but im just glad shes not in kindergarten this year
5737208 ive already done that once and it was much harder
5737209 there are no previous expectations we get to set the bar and the sky is really the limit for the teachers at woodrow cummins
5737210 and the kids are excited too they asked me at parent night what they were going to learn then so theyre ready this morning
5737211 i am very excited to come here and see all my new friends in my class
5737212 i want to learn my abcs my 123s and my shapes
5737213 he was excited but when we got to the school he did not want to get out of the car
5737214 but i told him it would be just like day care but better because hell have more friends so hes fine now
5737215 we have been so eager for the kids to come back
5737216 we have done a lot of things with the teachers over the summer and we love the teachers but we get to the point where we just cant wait to see the kids
5737217 we had a huge turnout of kids and parents and all of the kids are so excited
5737218 everything is smooth as ever and the transition into the new building was wonderful
5737219 this year we want to see high achievement we want everything to be student centered we want the best for each child and we just want to have success
5737220 we as a staff believe in you so you should challenge yourself more than you ever have before in previous school years
5737221 as you go through each stage of your life its going to get harder but if you challenge yourself to do your best you will be successful
5737222 things have been a little more disorganized today but even with all that we couldnt have asked for a better first day
5737223 i bet you fifty quid i could shwim fashter than you
5737224 ill meet you down at the schwimming pool at 9am tomorrow
5737225 ok keith i have heard you spout off about this foam roller thing on you dumb blog and even heard you talking about it at a bar down the shore one night what is it and how do i do it
5737226 to roll or not to roll keep rollin foam rolling the basics
5737227 the sad fact is that the older the child gets the less likely they are to be adopted to increase the opportunity for adoption for older children the gladney center for adoption created bright futures camps
5737228 when the children come to the camp they dont realize theyre being adopted so its even more of a surprise
5737229 it really protects the hearts of the kids that they dont realize theyre looking at being adopted
5737230 it really gives people a chance to decide if adoption is for their family
5737231 its really good for those prospective parents to learn where they came from that bonding experience starts in that country and makes it easier for the kids
5737232 you would think because of what theyve been through they would be distant but theyre very loving its amazing theyre happy
5737233 i was surprised of their acceptance of us as soon as they saw us they wanted to know us they would come grab our hands and jump in our arms we just wanted to take all of them home with us
5737234 they just want to be loved they just want a family unit they just want a place to call home
5737235 when i got there none of that was a factor
5737236 those kids dont have love they dont have food they dont have safety its not about adoption being a trend to me all that stuff is irrelevant its our role as the church to take care of the orphans and widows
5737237 i keep running into people who talk about how expensive adoption is but you can adopt a child a life for less than you pay for a car well take out a loan for a 25 000 to 30 000 car but how sweet to write a note every month for a life
5737238 there are interest free loans available for adoptions grants if people want to do it there are people out there who want to help you do it

5737275 re college pres trying to get drinking age lowered i think if kids can go to war and give their lives they should be able to drink too
5737276 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5737277 finally theres a big market again for high end games that doesnt require players to blast everything in sight with a rail gun
5737278 were setting sail on a new and far more ambitious course in the sea of interactive games we feel very lucky to have mike bilder formerly of midway games at the helm and by helm i actually mean desk were not really on a ship just a regular company in a building and everything
5737279 whether youre on the same couch with your friends or playing others over a network were going to combine the social dynamics created by great board games with the thrill and story arc of great television game shows

5737295 even touch wood with a gold medal i dont think it would help the game that immensely theres still a lot of things to work out and having teams coming in and out of the league theres no stability there
5737296 the fans are going to get fed up with it and i think thats whats happened
5737297 the nbls got a lot of work to do to get to the next level
5737298 i think off the floor there was a problem whereas on the floor theres some great talent the competition is there
5737299 but off the floor the marketing and those types of things need to get in order
5737300 its a very important time for our game in our country its taken some shots and a win wakes the whole country up
5737301 its like the socceroos in the world cup or the when wallabies play the all blacks

5737304 she was crook as a dog when we were there
5737305 the big thing from our point of view is that the highest accolade you can be afforded is to be chosen to represent your country state or club thats the pinnacle as far as were concerned if shed come last wed be more than happy
5737306 shes worked very hard to get here and she got a very good result in the end
5737307 vicki is in a class of her own at the moment but anna did very well just to get where she did
5737308 that semi final against guo was pretty nerve wracking we were all yelling because we thought shed done it then when the judges were deciding we held our breath when we saw it on the screen we thought guo might get relegated and when she did well we were pretty excited to get from where anna was to a gold medal final is a good effort were all proud of her
5737309 once implemented the new editorial structure will require substantially fewer journalists and the company is entering into consultation with staff and their representatives regarding this
5737310 the aim is to try to achieve this reduction by purely voluntary means all current editorial roles are being revised to reflect the increased multi skilling of journalists
5737311 staff will be given a full programme of multimedia skills training delivered by a specially assembled team to match the requirements of the new multimedia roles
5737312 the changes we are implementing in trinity mirror midlands represent a pioneering new approach to publishing
5737313 due to its oral activity and plausible long term durable response rate seen in ra patients in the initial multi center placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial oral dnajp1 may have an important clinical advantage over current injectable ra treatments which have significant toxicities our preliminary studies also strongly suggest that the mechanism of action of dnajp1 is complementary to current biologics thus providing the opportunity to develop combination therapies which may improve currently used regimens the long term statistically significant improvement in clinical scores as seen by acr20 and acr50 following cessation of drug therapy further suggests that this technology may be inducing a tolerogenic response
5737314 we are pleased to have broadened our therapeutic pipeline of products with the acquisition of this innovative program oral dnajp1 certainly complements our existing clinical stage immunology programs which include trimesta our oral phase ii iii clinical program in multiple sclerosis and our cd4 inhibitor technology we have been equally impressed with the rigor and quality of the scientific data along with the level of grant funding this program has received over the years from the nih we look forward to reporting additional clinical data from this study later this year
5737315 if we are serious about reducing global greenhouse emissions the nuclear option is one we cannot ignore
5737316 if australia expects to live up to the expectations the rudd government is creating and to be taken seriously in claiming to set an example it expects other nations to follow we simply must get real on nuclear energy
5737317 there will be no nuclear power industry in australia unless mr rudd has some sort of secret plan for it
5737318 the issue of nuclear power has to be debated rationally if australia is serious about making deep cuts to its greenhouse gas emissions
5737319 is it brendan nelson whos right and the liberal party doesnt stand for nuclear energy or is it mr macfarlane and ms bishop who are right and they do
5737320 the last election showed that australians are absolutely of one mind about not having 25 nuclear power plants dotted around their suburbs and in and around their cities

5737337 there was no evidence of this in aggregate wages data to date
5737338 clear evidence of that decline of inflation beginning however was unlikely to be seen for a while yet
5737339 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted
5737340 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5737341 the business surveys dont show any breakout in wages and there is no general sense of that
5737342 the private sector wage numbers released after the meeting showed that wage costs are broadly still under control
5737343 most forecasts including the reserve bank would have been anticipating weak growth this year in europe and japan but not an outright contraction
5737344 it is hard to see any industrialised country that has escaped the fall out from the credit crunch and is not experiencing a sharp slowdown
5737345 while people might aspire to living in the bush or on the coast actually the quality of life is much better in the suburbs of our major cities

5737347 this shows that salford city council can and will take action against anti social residents regardless of whether they are private social tenants or homeowners there are a range of powers available that we can use

5737352 with the lease for the hopkinton and woburn offices expiring concurrently we decided to consolidate our offices under one roof the new offices will be located at 239 south street hopkinton ma this facility will provide alseres with increased flexibility and expansion potential if needed
5737353 the new facility provides very attractive economics relative to the market a 3 year renewable lease and is expected to continue to reduce on going overhead expenses for facility operation which we believe will allow a greater share of financial resources to be devoted to program and business development
5737354 by bringing in an industry veteran like david teckman hairdx is poised to move forward as an innovator and leader in pharmacogenomics and healthcare research and development

5737357 het lijkt erop dat in vele gevallen de belangrijkste reden voor de verliezen van de banken in de kredietcrisis het onvermogen was om risicomanagement en interne controlesystemen met elkaar in verband te brengen en op elkaar af te stemmen essenti le schakels ontbreken vaak in de drie eenheid risk governance and control
5737358 het juist de interne beheersingssystemen die steeds meer bepalen wie de winnaars en de verliezers zijn in de mondiale financi le sector
5737359 governance risicomanagement en interne controle zijn de belangrijkste uitdagingen voor financi le instellingen op dit moment naarmate de lat voor interne beheersing en compliance met wet en regelgeving steeds hoger komt te liggen moet de raad van bestuur aan de verschillende toezichthouders kunnen bewijzen dat zij in control zijn

5737454 de gedragscode die de zorginstellingen volgen blijkt waardeloos er moet een keiharde norm zijn negeert een organisatie die dan moet zij de toelating voor het verlenen van awbz zorg verliezen ook als er geen openheid wordt gegeven moet de toelating vervallen

5737473 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5737474 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5737475 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5737476 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5737477 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5737478 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5737479 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5737480 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5737481 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5737482 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5737483 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5737484 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5737485 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5737486 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5737487 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5737488 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5737489 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5737490 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5737491 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5737492 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5737493 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5737494 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5737495 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5737496 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5737497 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5737498 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5737499 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5737500 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5737501 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5737506 indian companies will take their rightful place in the international arena
5737507 enterprises and individuals must recognise and adapt to these fundamental economic changes we believe that those with a fossilised frame of mind risk being marginalised
5737508 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso

5737551 we are not launching an agitation against any industry we only want to hear about the return of the 400 acre of land
5737552 buddhadeb should accept my challenge that it is wrong information or otherwise he should resign
5737553 if the government is really interested to set up the nano car plant it should build it on the 600 acre and start searching for additional land for ancillary industries elsewhere
5737554 i will never compromise on peoples movement i am ready to shed blood rather than bow my head

5737559 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5737560 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5737561 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5737562 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5737563 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5737564 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5737565 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5737566 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5737567 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5737568 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5737569 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5737570 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

5737576 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
5737577 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5737578 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5737579 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5737580 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo

5737585 pergunto me se as pessoas que s o realmente afectados pelas pol ticas neo liberais est o aqui no evento
5737586 a palavra neoliberalismo pode ser interpretada de muitas maneiras e ainda por cima muitas pessoas nunca tinham ouvido falar nesta palavra antes
5737587 a minha primeira experi ncia no f rum foi muito frustrante

5737589 for the most part it is not even overtly political since the subject of immigration is tucked away mccarthy succeeds in delivering a humanist portrait of individuals colliding rather than a lecture on the ills and hypocrisy of americas change of heart over immigration after 9 1
5737590 if the film falters its with an unnecessary boat trip past the statue of liberty that threatens to negate this subtlety
5737591 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5737592 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5737593 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws and constitutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
5737594 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
5737595 joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
5737596 the democrats in the senate are in a tough spot they have 51 votes joe lieberman organizes with them
5737597 in 85 days or something they will have five more democrats they wont need him to make the majority and it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does at that point in terms of

5737605 no es aceptable concebir que una empresa que se adjudica la concesi n de una ruta de tanto movimiento como es esta que une santiago con valpara so no adopte por mandato contractual y por razones b sicas de seguridad todas aquellas medidas que impidan u obstaculicen la libre circulaci n vehicular evitando as que a sus usuarios se les produzcan da os con motivo del uso de tal v a concesionada

5737607 one explanation might be that theres a group of consumers thats holding off making do with the devices that they have either because of larger economic concerns or because they dont see any value yet in the new voice and data services that are driving some of these new handsets
5737608 the company will likely achieve decent levels of profitability in the next few years but longer term operating margins will likely become more difficult to maintain due to increasing market saturation and the entrance of new competitors
5737609 the essure female sterilization procedure appears to be similar to tubal ligations from an efficacy safety standpoint but is less invasive offers faster recovery time for patients and can be performed more efficiently
5737610 if we do switch to a different chemical has that chemical been thoroughly vetted and are there side affects that impact people and children
5737611 in the end this bill is about a synthetic hormone that is in our childrens food

5737624 were still hoping that morgan freemans injuries will not preclude him from starring in the movie
5737625 the only thing i know is that hes healing nicely
5737626 if we keep notebooks we will expect and welcome diversity
5737627 acho que a import ncia disso ainda maior por causa do meu fracasso em 2004 para conquistar essa medalha de ouro hoje eu me esforcei ao m ximo isso n o nada f cil estou muito orgulhoso
5737628 a school is a factory is a poem is a prison is academia is boredom with flashes of panic
5737629 questions about potential conflicts of interest from his wifes work
5737630 when youre vetting a vice president and his wife is on seven boards that is a serious question of conflict of interest on a whole variety of issues
5737631 above and beyond what is required under senate ethics rules
5737632 there is a wall preventing any and all lobbying contact
5737633 spouses of public servants deserve the opportunity to pursue success in their chosen fields of endeavor
5737634 i sent off hundreds of letters and c v s
5737635 all to no avail i was desperate to get going so i thought i would have a go at running a restaurant i had had this in mind since my teens to one day run a place of my own i love eating my mother was an excellent cook and often when i ate out i thought that i could serve up far tastier dishes
5737636 when i saw it for the first time it was sad and sinister dingy and dark the walls were black water was running everywhere creepers covered the building after all it hadnt been lived in for almost a quarter of a century well it just looked awful anyway i went to the local mairie and asked a few questions i dont really know why out of curiosity i guess they told me to contact the sncf when i returned with my wife to view it for a second time it all seemed so different it was a lovely day the sun was shining there just seemed to be a magical atmosphere the high ceilings the ticket office and so on and in my minds eye i could see my restaurant right away then i was informed about the price 300 000 francs 30 000 it was so cheap i went and signed for it right away
5737637 what saved us was an article in the midi libre
5737638 because from that moment on we became known whereas on some sundays we were doing 2 places for lunch well suddenly we went up to over 30
5737639 if there is anyone else out there thinking of buying a disused railway station and converting it into a restaurant
5737640 i would say go for it after all life is short and you have to pursue your dream even if others might brand it as a folie do be warned though running a restaurant is bloody hard work long hours and with often little in it remaining for you
5737641 i am no relation to connie booth from the television series
5737642 but sometimes i do feel as if i am the phone is constantly ringing one customer might be complaining that the air conditioning is too strong another that the toilet isnt working properly and i have been know to thrown the occasional wobbly just like basil
5737643 oh lovely i take it that your wife is french then
5737644 when we first saw the hotel we both fell in love with it it was as simple as that
5737645 we thought that it was such a beautiful place that people would be bound to come along and like it too we did everything ourselves from chambermaiding to carpentry the lot we also did everything humanly possible to make it succeed i remember in the early days we once had a coach load of italians on their way to pilgrimage at lourdes i dont know what happened there but there must have been some kind of miracle because they all stopped off again for meal on their way back to rome when i left school i took a city and guilds in cookery and dressmaking when i came to live in france i really wanted to work and to work while doing that that i enjoyed i remember tonys reaction well right he said into the kitchen you go
5737646 to other english couples who might be tempted to rush out here and set up shop i would say beware
5737647 its only too easy to fall flat on your face and a lot of people do you have to know the french ropes which include the crippling cost of their social charges and which have been the ruination of many a small business
5737648 i just wanted to be successful at something just as i had been in my modeling career
5737649 making crowns bridges and braces but i cant say that i particularly enjoyed the work then my father had to retire early on the grounds of ill health and we were both keen for the family business to continue and since then we have gone from strength to strength
5737650 just because we use modern techniques doesnt mean that our product is inferior to the old fashioned home made artisan style of production it all depends upon the quality of materials that you use and we use the very best in fact since we work by computer and under controlled conditions you can be sure that our nougat is always the same and not dependent upon the such factors as humidity
5737651 and we are proud of that reputation but there is more to montelimar than nougat we now have to think ahead to the next century too we do not want to be have to face another disaster as we did in may 1968 so we are determined to diversify as much as we possibly can
5737652 but lets say that with hindsight it probably wasnt a very wise decision to recall a billion of our bottles worldwide that meant that supermarket shelves were empty for some 3 to 4 months whilst waiting for fresh supplies to arrive which in turn meant that our competitors snapped up the new opportunity im a little reluctant to criticize the old management team but lets say that there might well have been other more sensible options
5737653 people out here are very happy to have an english plumber its a sort of status symbol it sounds good i have one customer who tells his friends that he has the queens plumber le plombier de la reine down here in the south at least half the people have latin roots that means that they have no idea of what being on time means so if you are punctual and reliable they look at you with amazement and consider that they have found a friend for life of course people kid me worrying that i might put the pipes the wrong way round because we drive on the other side of the road but you can rest assured that i give as good as i get
5737654 that whole thing about french plumbing not being up to scratch is a load of old rubbish anyway
5737655 some members of my own family still wont come out to france because they think french plumbing is so bad
5737656 and that is the social charges they take 60 per cent of what you can earn there are so many taxes its crippling the worst system in the world
5737657 for me it has all been a great success i had nothing when i came here now i had a house a pool and a boat i dont think all of that would have come my way in england here i stand out people remember me whereas in england i do think that would have remained one of the crowd some english people who see my way of life here which includes quite a bit of golf look on a little enviously commenting that it must be very nice it is but you still have to work you still have to pay your bills and when i got to work outside the temperature can be anything up to 35 degree and that hits you and then its my turn to be working while i watch other people with their feet up by their swimming pools
5737658 as soon as i walked inside the courtyard of ch teau de madi re
5737659 i knew that i had found my home here was the dream i had had in my mind for so very many years even though it was a ruin because i could see immediately what could be done i asked to spend a couple of nights in the ch teau i wanted to know if the atmosphere was right i slept more deeply and more peacefully than i had ever slept before
5737660 and i was in no doubt that that was how the ch teau should be up market exclusive and expensive the sort of place that could be run as a business of course but much more than that i wanted a very nice place to live in somewhere you would be proud to welcome guests and to show off as your home
5737661 i wont deny that i have become completely obsessed by the ch teau
5737662 or indeed that madi re has become my danseuse a kind of passion and an expensive passion at that i havent had any children myself never had the time and i guess that you could also say that madi re has also become my child a child which i have grown to love more and more every day as the years have slipped by
5737663 my wife has not been the driving force behind the restoration of the ch teau
5737664 but rather the locomotive in the end it has worked out well a second life for both of us it has been expensive true but we dont like to think too closely about the money side of things because it is not so much a business as a pleasure
5737665 well imagine what its like in a huge open space with the power of tons of explosives behind you people stop they look they listen and they seldom fail to be impressed
5737666 beneath our feet under the crust of the earth there is a huge mass of fire in fact we are only able to live because of the heat and light provided by the sun which is itself a huge ball of fire so the whole concept of fire goes to the very core of our existence
5737667 barcelona took years of preparation it was my one big moment to turn night into day and when it was all over i just felt hollow it was ecstatic but tragic because nothing could ever more spectacular it took a while to rekindle my passion
5737668 as an art form les feux dartifices is scorned by intellectuals because it is ephemeral and has cheap commercial connotations
5737669 i consider myself most privileged to have found this field and to be paid for doing what i love its a veritable pleasure which renews itself each and every time i put on a show when its all over i will do my best to travel back to my wife and small son although naturally thats often not possible like most pyrotechnicians im partially deaf because of the outrageous noise levels so when my head hits the pillow im dead to the world not even a banger could stir me
5737670 these are romantic images which you are harbouring and which are not necessarily accurate that said the rule of silence was certainly much stricter when i entered the monastery for the first time back in 1950 the rules have relaxed somewhat since then there are two types of monastic life solitary and communal we have opted for the latter which means that we are always together whether that be working eating or sleeping this means that we need stricter rules to respect silence in the past we used to sign to each other you know pass the bread the water and so on but we dont do that anymore but we still do respect silence we dont speak when we go by one another in corridors or in the refectory for example so you could say that we have a minimum of dialogue enough for communal life to function whilst at the same time respecting one of the key promises made by all benedictines and cistercians at the time of their monastic profession to respect the discipline of controlling ones tongue
5737671 you will have to excuse me but i am heading up this service and i simply have to go in any event you know that this abbey functions successfully because of our manufacture of cheese so i would very much like you to meet fr re nathana l who oversees our entire cheese operation but for that you had better come back tomorrow in between the eurchariste service at 7 35 am and the tierce at 9 30 that should allow you ample time goodbye
5737672 entering religious life and discovering god has in my view much common ground with falling in love
5737673 some people think that as a monk i am something of a soft touch to deal with
5737674 but they soon find out that i am not the abbey lives from its cheese so without wishing to exaggerate my importance here i do have a key role but no one is indispensable others did this before me and no doubt others will do so in the future that said we are but one of three abbeys in france which continue to make cheese we buy the milk and see the product through until it reaches the consumer on the shelves
5737675 but isnt the phrase business moine just a little contradictory at the end of the day
5737676 you know embracing profits and capitalism on the one hand and trying to marry it in with god and spirituality on the other
5737677 that is my challenge to straddle these two worlds but in reality i can and do assimilate the business and moine parts of me i dont claim to be a particularly good businessperson in reality i am more of technician in fact my job also involves a fair bit of local politics and tourism too that does mean though that i cant always make each of the seven services we have i have to go out on deliveries on tuesdays meet with farmers and suppliers and so on i also have to deal with the quality control people and sometimes officials acting on directives from brussels too so of course when there is a service taking place i do have things spinning in my head a meeting here a negotiation there and the truth is that i simply cant cut off that easily from the world of cheese and leap into the world of spirituality a lot is not an easy one you know and if i am entirely honest with you as for my faith well like all loves i think its lost some of its initial vigour and enthusiasm although at the same time i guess you could say that its become deeper and more firmly rooted thank goodness that my day is punctuated by the services and meditation because these breaks remind me that i am not just here to make cheese
5737678 you head up a business you dont pay your workers a penny you dont work the short 35 hour week like most people in france you never go on strike and you dont even get paid goodness me what a wonderful set up from the bosss perspective i wish i had a hundred workers like you
5737679 you say that but is that the business man or the monk speaking
5737680 es un nuevo r cord en la historia de las olimp adas casi el doble de la cifra contabilizada durante el acto inaugural de los ol mpicos de atenas en 2004

5737683 we are told by the holy fathers that we are supposed to see in everything something for our salvation if you can do this you can be saved
5737684 the true christian is a warrior making his way through the regiments of the invisible enemy to his heavenly homeland
5737685 anyone who is attracted merely by glittering censors incense and beautiful vestments he first of all will fall down before antichrist
5737686 when i became christian i voluntarily crucified my mind and all the crosses that i bear have only been a source of joy for me i have lost nothing and gained everything
5737687 do not trust your mind too much thinking must be refined by suffering or it will not stand the test of these cruel times
5737688 die entsch digungssumme die vom gericht verh ngt worden ist ist bezeichnend und soll f r andere nutzer abschreckend wirken

5737691 filesharing ist ein massenph nomen bei der menge an tauschb rsennutzern w rde eine verfolgung des einzelnen das problem einer unmenge an strafverfahren mit sich bringen
5737692 awalnya iya tapi kemudian saya sadar kalau itu merugikan diri sendiri dan sekarang saya malah merasa prihatin dengan orang2 yang tidak bisa melihat dan merasakan kecantikan sebenarnya yang ada dibalik fisik ini
5737693 that was tantamount to a binding contract with your employers and as such you couldnt pull out of it but as soon as my time was up on my twenty first birthday i left my job and set off for the tour du valat in the camargue everyone including my own parents thought that i was stark raving mad
5737694 we campaigned by asking both military and civil pilots including those from a number of major international airlines not to fly purposefully over the birds you could quite understand why pilots would wish to do this because seen from a plane a flock of flamingos is quite beautiful our lobbying went quite well but it did take a good couple of years by and large though our message was quite well received it was more a question of education than anything else
5737695 the camargue is now threatened with a new programme of mosquito control dont get me wrong i cant stand mosquitoes but if you want to live in the camargue you have to learn to live with them reducing mosquitoes will no doubt bring more people into the area but a sudden rush of tourists will have a negative impact flamingos feed on mosquito larvae im not saying its their most important food but you dont tinker with nature wetland areas are continuing to shrink and we dont want to expedite that process in any way there are also plans afoot to build a bridge over the rhone at salin de giraud its another example of progress at the expense of the environment i am dead against both projects
5737696 i returned to the factory in the midlands a few years ago the one where i had completed my apprenticeship in carpentry it seemed to have fallen foul of the thatcher revolution and had clearly not been functioning for some time of course i was sorry that people might have lost their jobs but at the same time it did confirm to me that i was right not to have heeded my parents advice to remain in carpentry when my interest in life was always the great outdoors my work with flamingos here in the camargue has not been an ordinary 9 to 5 job its been my entire life an all consuming passion that same passion that i experienced as a teenager still very much there there is not the slightest room for complacency though for the need to conserve the wonderful wildlife we have is now greater than ever before
5737697 it seemed to me all too clear that there was nothing in france in between the expensive and snooty parfumeries on the one hand and the supermarkets where you get no advice and cant test the products on the other as an anthropologist i was attracted to the trade not aid concept as articulated by anita roddick we went off to see wilf gillender who owned the french rights through his company gw management he had been very successful with body shop in newcastle where had flash offices we could hardly sign on the dotted line quickly enough we felt very much that we wanted to be pioneers even though we had no figures to base our decisions on we put in over 100 000 pounds of our own money funds generated almost entirely from my husbands ducati motorbike business the remaining 170 000 was loaned to us by a bank we entered into these commitments willingly aware that the green market was underdeveloped in france besides i knew for myself that body shop products were good there was not the slightest doubt in our minds that the french were going to lap it up
5737698 but my attitude began to change quite early on when i realized that a number of financial promises that had been made to us for example about margins had not been kept
5737699 its the sort of attitude that you can walk into a country where you dont speak the language dont know the culture and customs apply what you have done in the newcastle and think that it will work gw management still has no french directors to this day the whole story is a catastrophe from start to finish and one for which i hold gw management totally responsible and as for body shop international they simply dont want to know either
5737700 we cant afford to walk away much as we would like to for we have too many debts and dont laugh for years the montpellier shop was held up as the very model of how a body shop in france should be run prospective franchisees often being referred on to us despite all of our problems my shop remains the top performing shop in france outside of paris and it still isnt making any money bsi have squandered a five year flying start in france now yves rocher has done it for himself and jumped onto the green bandwagon so my view is that the body shop has missed the french boat altogether
5737701 last week the guardians revelation that the spanish olympic basketball team had posed for an advertising campaign with the skin around their eyes pulled back
5737702 am ersten tag der olympischen spiele hielt sich die zahl der anfragen f r werbe und marketingauftritte noch sehr in grenzen
5737703 seit diesem wochenende erhalten wir rund 50 anfragen pro tag
5737704 ich mache das nun schon eine ganze weile aber mit dem was hier passiert habe ich ganz sicher nicht gerechnet
5737705 dieser wert k nnte sich nun aber zumindest kurzfristig verdoppeln
5737706 das interesse das ein sportler f r marketingzwecke hervorruft h ngt von mehreren aspekten ab
5737707 aber auch der stellenwert den eine spezifische sportart in einem bestimmten land inne hat ist in diesem zusammenhang ausschlaggebend
5737708 entscheidend ist auch wie oft ein sportler in der ffentlichkeit auftaucht im bereich des schwimmsports ist eine vermarktung deshalb schwieriger da nur zwei drei gro ereignisse pro jahr stattfinden
5737709 all diese faktoren ergeben den mehrwert eines sportler der festlegt wie interessant er im endeffekt f r das marketing von unternehmen ist

5737792 from available statistics 100 000 infants die from sickle cell disease in nigeria annually making it the number one sickle cell endemic country in africa
5737793 nigeria accounts for 75 percent of infant sickle cell cases in africa and almost 80 percent of infant deaths from the disease in the continent

5737796 with one out of every five africans being a nigerian and this countrys high rate of malarial transmission it is obvious nigeria stands at a disadvantage as far as sickle cell is concerned

5737922 they really gouge authors and i cant take it when i buy an isbn in hong kong it costs me just one third to one half of what id pay at a mainland publisher
5737923 in my estimation in ten years mainland works may become the mainstream of the hong kong book market
5737924 it saddens me when im called a businessman or a political figure
5737925 the existence of mirror books for the last twenty years demonstrates the reality of one country two systems it is the best proof that hong kong guarantees a free press
5737926 this novel is really something its too bad no one reads fiction these days
5737927 how about this well put out a taiwan edition and then help you do one for hong kong what do you say
5737928 looking back now my worries were unnecessary one country two systems is a long term strategy of the communist party not just the most expedient option like many people were saying at the time
5737929 i dont have the heart to read most of the manuscripts were sent because its torture most of them are individual accounts of experiences during the anti rightist movement and the cultural revolution its not that the quality is bad its just that they marketplace cant absorb so many personal memoirs we cant make a living publishing them but if we dont i cant take the authors response to being rejected i feel as if ive let them down
5737930 this book is the embodiment of my whole lifes worth
5737931 to tell the truth my greatest hope for mirror is just to keep it going not to expand it
5737932 in all its years mirror has never accepted any government funding and it has never taken on any commercial investment it relies entirely on publishing i did things this way because i wanted to maintain mirror books identity as an independent news publisher
5737933 beijing is quite tolerant of me and very polite ive never felt any pressure or harassment
5737934 we hunanese have that sort of temperament if youre polite to us we reign it in a little so this might be one of the things putting mirror and china media net on a more moderate road i dont really want to play the role of the political opposition what i want to do is establish a platform for the expression of many voices and views

5737975 it will depend on the half yearly review by march next the further opening up will be based on the review findings

5737978 it would invalidate the effort of the knox charter petition group to get their charter amendments on the ballot

5737982 similarly most turks of today think it is fine to ethnically cleanse greek cypriots and take their lands because greek cypriots are
5737983 but how can it be turkish when the great majority of the native population has been greek for 1000s of years
5737984 greek cypriots are fill the gap with the usual turkish propaganda painting gcs as the evil monsters so we had to protect the innocent turkish cypriots so now north cyprus is turkish

5738009 west africas annual floods bring with them not only the threat of vector borne and communicable diseases but it further endangers the lives of people already malnourished by the food price crisis
5738010 many roads in the region are inaccessible due to the floods
5738011 the biggest problem is the combination of floods and the food crisis

5738035 contrary to inflammatory headlines generated by the release of kpmgs medical schemes anti fraud survey when placed in context the statistics actually show that fraudulent claims perpetrated by pharmacies are infinitesimal and that they have decreased
5738036 rather than an epidemic of fraud what the report actually shows is that there is a small problem with fraudulent claims to medical schemes which can and must be addressed by service providers and others
5738037 the conclusion that gps and pharmacies are the largest perpetrators of fraud may well be true but it is coming off a very small base

5738158 you both print out your credit reports bring them to dinner and share them
5738159 i regularly hear from readers that they married someone they found out afterwards had tens of thousands of dollars in debt
5738160 your credit reports never co mingle you always maintain your own credit report your scores will never bleed over
5738161 technically you can keep your finances separate and your scores separate but if you are dealing with a bad credit scores it will affect your life
5738162 its harder to get out of a co signed loan than it is to get out of a marriage
5738163 the stunning part is the horrible advice some people get
5738164 for someone to go through a divorce and leave an account open is amazing youre paying a lawyer a lot for advice and they should know better
5738165 and actually pulling a credit report is really a neutral thing in black and white
5738166 say hey how funny would it be to compare our credit scores
5738167 youve got to get off your high horse a little bit keep in mind that the goal is not to make the other person feel bad its to make sure your financial life is as harmonious as possible
5738168 you dont want any surprises that could threaten the relationship later
5738169 first discuss commitment then this should be your next discussion

5738173 my mother has end stage leukaemia and we had to get a carer in who worked for the primary care trust pct
5738174 the next day my mum said 40 had gone out of her purse
5738175 emma wrote down the serial numbers on three 20 notes in my mums purse and we got a 55 camera from the local diy store
5738176 emma said the camera lens was just like the eye of the teddy bear in the house so we put the camera inside
5738177 we thought it would be a long process but she was greedy
5738178 we called the police and showed them the footage and gave them the serial numbers
5738179 she thelma has seen justice before she dies she was glad to hear the sentence
5738180 we can confirm that a former health care assistant employed by the provider arm of liverpool primary care trust has been arrested and convicted of stealing from a patient
5738181 liverpool primary care trust has fully supported merseyside police in this investigation and the member of staff involved was immediately suspended following their arrest
5738182 for large spacecraft this is done with mechanical louvers basically glorified window blinds that open and close to allow in or reflect heat
5738183 but as satellites get smaller these systems get too heavy and bulky
5738184 weve used thermal insulation similar to what youd find in a fridge and were finding that we need better ways than purely insulating layers to make sure that our spacecraft maintain the right temperature
5738185 there are lots of ways to cool and heat things but they all tend to be complicated and require power and could potentially break down
5738186 something very simple like this requiring minimal power and with minimal mechanical things to go wrong could be quite a useful thing to put on small spacecraft
5738187 ive gotten literally hundreds of letters over the last week from women saying they would still love it if she were the nominee or if he would pick her
5738188 theres a case for hillary to be on the ticket but the real question is is bill a voice for the campaign and the administration and what do you do about disclosing all of the donors to his foundation and his library
5738189 picking her would have a groundswell impact on democrats but not picking her will leave her to have a new role leading on her issues and supporting barack for president
5738190 i think the convention will help bring the wings of the party together especially the fact that senator clintons name will be put in nomination for a roll call vote that will make a big difference
5738191 as for picking senator clinton as vice president thats senator obamas decision

5738193 en un momento de crisis de las compa as a reas como el actual
5738194 demostraci n de la debilidad del gobierno catal n ya que lo que tendr a que reclamar a zapatero es el cumplimiento inmediato del estatut y no aceptar m s dilaciones
5738195 deje de marear la perdiz se ponga las pilas y presente una propuesta de financiaci n auton mica que se ajuste al estatut y cumpla sus objetivos y compromisos cosa que no ha hecho hasta ahora
5738196 a catalu a no le conviene este debate en el congreso porque rompe la bilateralidad
5738197 reservas de que los socialistas cambien su postura si no hay una posici n de fuerza de todas las fuerzas pol ticas catalanas
5738198 entendemos que persiguen unos objetivos distintos y van en la direcci n de desgastar al gobierno y de ir contra el sistema de financiaci n establecido en el estatut
5738199 no es menos cierto que el ejercicio anterior esta empresa lo hab a cerrado con beneficios y lo que no es de recibo es que sean los trabajadores y las trabajadoras los que a costa de su salarios deban cubrir la falta de beneficio que no p rdidas que se est n dando en muchos sectores
5738200 la reducci n de personal o de servicios afectar a no s lo a los trabajadores de fred olsen sino tambi n a otros sectores productivos como el turismo y a los propios ciudadanos de canarias poniendo adem s en peligro la comunicaci n entre islas sobre todo aquellas que tienen m s limitado el acceso como es el caso de la gomera y el hierro
5738201 si la empresa decide unilateralmente implantar su criterio tal y como ha hecho hasta ahora no tendremos otra alternativa que llevar a cabo movilizaciones
5738202 the internet allows us to reach those people who arent reliant solely on mainstream media and other information gatekeepers
5738203 the consistent thread that ties together all of our fans is that theyre adventurous listeners
5738204 the internet has allowed us to find people who are just out there exploring and looking for new and interesting sounds its allowed us to have a direct two way connection with our existing fans and also uncover new audiences
5738205 this audience was very moved by the music and wanted to delve deeper
5738206 the internet allowed them to discover kronos has this whole history requiem for a dream became an entry point for all of these people who then became involved with kronos in other ways
5738207 the way that project happened was that darren emailed us at our website and didnt have to go through any other extraneous barriers
5738208 its been fascinating to watch how audiences respond to and interact with an artist they like
5738209 were constantly fascinated by the photographs that people put up of the group the videos that people take in public settings various things that they say about the group in blog posts all very personal reactions
5738210 even though kronos tours five months a year its limited how many different places in the world we can go
5738211 what were realizing is that there are so many other ways via the internet to be able to get more music to the people who want to hear it theres also so much repertoire that kronos plays that isnt available on cd and yet are really fascinating pieces of music this one way to get that music out there
5738212 the open internet has really influenced the work that we do
5738213 kronos has been so international in its scope and in its way of hearing the world and the music that kronos plays is not just from america and europe its from all over the place its from azerbaijan its from new zealand its from china its from russia from india its really been about sound and how humans express sound throughout all of their cultures around the world we dont see the world in a boundaried way we dont hear the world in a boundaried way and the internet has allowed us to remove a lot of those boundaries
5738214 what weve seen with the consolidation of all these different media outlets newspapers television stations and radio stations is that musicians are having a harder time accessing those outlets
5738215 because its so consolidated the information that corporations think is valuable to their audiences is very narrow in focus and really filtered
5738216 we have all been able to individually identify those filters that we trust
5738217 whether its government controlled or controlled by a private entity like a telecom if theyre choosing priorities for what content were receiving and we dont even know about it then that becomes a major problem
5738218 we feel that an internet where the content isnt prioritized by another entity is essential to every artist whose work doesnt fit into the narrow focus of consolidated mainstream media
5738219 and it should also be considered essential for every listener whose interest extends beyond those limits artists who dont have the resources shouldnt have to pay tolls to access the internet highway a highway that has become an essential part of our contemporary life
5738220 we hear these tropes all the time about how classical music is dead how classical music listeners are all old how classical music listeners are not really engaged with the rest of american culture
5738221 but if you have a couple of twentysomethings live blogging an opera webcast from a performance from 1960 you see that the audience is not all retired that there is an active listening audience out there for classical music
5738222 this community of people has found each other and is engaged in constant daily dialogue about music
5738223 its just a love of music thats brought them together into a community via the internet without any boundaries

5738272 it was in violation of chinas law on demonstrations and protests
5738273 the move to set aside protest areas is in line with beijings promises to the international olympic committee to adhere to the olympic traditions such as free expression outside the sporting venues

5738315 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response

5738317 some concern for bisphenol a exposure in these populations based on effects in the prostate gland mammary gland and an earlier age for puberty in females
5738318 exposure of pregnant women to bisphenol a will result in fetal or neonatal mortality birth defects or reduced birth weight and growth in their offspring

5738320 we had one error where we failed to stop the progress of the ball
5738321 and they slipped in behind us other than that we played well on defense
5738322 and we won the battle of the midfield abby davis did a good job
5738323 in the second half we tried to get the ball to the flags
5738324 and forced them to come out im really proud of my team
5738325 they didnt do anything we didnt talk about they didnt do anything that surprised us we play hard but we have to get a better understanding of the game
5738326 we are still honestly trying to learn the game of soccer
5738327 we graduated seven seniors and by the end of last year all seven were starting were replacing a lot of people at a lot of different positions
5738328 one thing about last years team is we had seven senior starters and a lot of depth on the bench
5738329 they didnt do anything we didnt expect them to do but we didnt do what we were supposed to do
5738330 thats what you do improve every day in practice in every game we got off to rough start last year and turned it around pretty quick and im confident we can do the same thing this year
5738331 there were 20 minutes in the first half when we played very well and there were other times we played a little too anxious for the final results we were working for
5738332 one thing i didnt see in the scrimmages we played was getting the 50 50 balls
5738333 we got most of them tonight and thats what i wanted to see
5738334 we played very well in the second half of the first scrimmage
5738335 and we played very well against north bullitt theyre just a very good team
5738336 the majority of our players are back from last years team
5738337 we lost some key seniors but weve replaced them with younger teammates
5738338 it was pretty intense but the pre season is paying off in terms of conditioning as well as being fundamentally sound
5738339 our goal is to keep him from getting daddys money
5738340 this concludes a successful effort by our division of enforcement to stop fraud in its tracks return as much money as possible to defrauded investors and to bring wrongdoers to justice

5738348 im just trying to get through to the next round
5738349 the rivalry has always been there theyve always been strong so its nothing new
5738350 i dont think anythings changed just because of what happening in the 100
5738351 its a shame a final should be with the best ones

5738359 these are all the same people who have a big lobbying presence in d c and they all have major issues before congress and the executive branch
5738360 evidently we didnt do enough work in the last 10 days
5738361 like i told them its my fault for trying to save them a little bit and not beat them up on the practice field so we came down here and got beat up in the game
5738362 as soon as we got back to practice amani showed me
5738363 hes the best in the business at that he knows just how to stay in even if he has to fall doing it
5738364 a hat trick in a quarter is not a bad night
5738365 as you saw we didnt play very good they outcoached us they outplayed us we were in it for a second
5738366 then we got too many penalties and penalties changed field position the first quarter basically was the game it was unbelievable
5738367 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
5738368 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5738369 the patience of our soldiers in trying to uphold the primacy of the peace process is very commendable but at some point we really have to act decisively
5738370 t he khl shouldnt need a moratorium to adhere to a policy of respecting legal and binding contractual commitments

5738372 aber es kann auch einfach nur bedeuten die leute haben weniger daten angezeigt
5738373 die kriminalit t ist r ckl ufig die polizei leistet tagt glich gro artige arbeit
5738374 tatsache ist dass die statistik von jeder einzelnen polizistin und jedem einzelnen polizisten bef llt wird das system l sst es nicht zu dass delikte bearbeitet werden ohne dass diese in der kriminalstatistik aufscheinen
5738375 wer nach dem diebstahl eines autoradios oder eines navigationsger tes zur polizei geht und dies zur anzeige bringt erf hrt durch die blume dass die wahrscheinlichkeit auf erfolg bei der aufkl rung gegen null geht
5738376 wenn man diese anzeige nicht zwingend f r die versicherung ben tigt oder eine rein statistische erfassung begehrt verzichten die meisten heute auf eine solche anzeige weil der b rokratische aufwand ein gigantischer ist
5738377 wir sind der meinung dass sie die statistik anmk frisiert ist

5738379 he really is the leader of show jumping in canada
5738380 he comes down to the maritime fall fair every year hes an absolutely outstanding person
5738381 i mean i had goosebumps this morning when we were watching it here in the store on the computer live we were all screaming and yelling it was incredible to watch because you always know that well obviously its his ninth olympics and its so incredible to actually see him get this
5738382 but for the other three riders as well theyve worked so hard and eric lamaze has had such an awful time and for him to be redeemed in the last couple of years and to get this medal is incredible
5738383 as he says himself that was the lowest point of his life
5738384 four to six years ago really was the lowest point of his life and for him to come back now and first of all be selected for this team and actually win the medal is just phenomenal
5738385 for so long the canadians have been in the back seat
5738386 they had not great horses theyve come 30th and 40th at the olympics and to go from that to now winning a medal just shows how far theyve come and ian really is the leader in all of this just about everybody thats come up through the international ranks has schooled with him at some point
5738387 im sure that hes a mentor to many of the up and comers it was jill henselwoods first olympic experience and im sure that he mentored her all the way
5738388 it means a lot to have him come to nova scotia
5738389 he brings the skill up to a degree that we have quite competitive jumpers
5738390 we were very pleased and excited for the team they work hard and it was especially nice to see ian millar get a medal

5738406 die songs bestanden zu dieser zeit zum gr ten teil aus melodien und worten welche instrumente eingespielt werden und wie die arrangements klingen sollten war mir da noch nicht klar es war sehr inspirierend auf diese art zu arbeiten die songs konnten sich in ihrer eigenheit entwickeln und ihrer eigenen bestimmung folgen sie hatten eine gewisse freiheit die ich mir im umgang mit ihnen zunutze machte

5738425 barack obama likes to portray himself as a centrist politician who wants to unite the country but occasionally his postpartisan mask slips that was the case at saturday nights saddleback church forum when mr obama chose to demean supreme court justice clarence thomas

5738433 a stellar place where bike guys can and will speak to anyone about anything to do about bikes
5738434 our main business here isnt bike rentals were a small shop
5738435 ill never want to go back to the place where they give you free rubbing alcohol with your decent sushi
5738436 i enjoyed a pricey but genuinely fun celebratory meal at this location of gyu kaku with two of my best friends last month and i have to say
5738437 do you think i would have spent this much time on you for 30
5738438 obviously in terms of if it was indexed from day one it would be about 75 000 today so thats an issue on the table
5738439 its a balancing act between easing the tax burden but ensuring there arent unintended consequences with a greater burden public hospital system
5738440 in order to stay competitive businesses seek to pass cost increases on to their customers
5738441 what woodside have said is significant because its the most explicit warning from industry that they are going to have to pass on the tax for consumers
5738442 if youre telling me they want to work ill give them a go
5738443 why not ill employ anyone so long as they are willing to work
5738444 the kind of money which employers are putting up to bring them in and repatriate them would be much better invested in getting local aboriginal people a start in the local economy
5738445 the fact that weve got a substantial pool of unemployed people who are our immediate ongoing responsibility makes this an exercise in folly because obviously if any of these pacific islanders are working nearby high unemployment aboriginal towns the local people are going to feel cheated
5738446 my frustration in all this stuff is the inept failure of government to actually engage
5738447 to hear that the government are proposing to bring in more overseas workers when aboriginal people are disadvantaged in the workforce is shameful
5738448 i cant understand them importing people from other places when youve got really high unemployment in your town be it aboriginal white or what
5738449 every season we get aboriginal people here picking fruit for us
5738450 any person who comes in looking for work gets put on
5738451 in a place like robinvale thriving industry not enough workers they should be supplied from within australia
5738452 if weve got a work shortage in places like cape york and theyve got a worker shortage down here we should provide the workers
5738453 if youre going to fly people from the pacific islands whats wrong with flying people from cape york for instance or karratha or melbourne or sydney or brisbane or nhulunbuy
5738454 sick to death of watching their fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick
5738455 while people might aspire to living in the bush or on the coast actually the quality of life is much better in the suburbs of our major cities
5738456 the tasmanian people are saying david we are trusting you to clean up this mess and thats what im going to do step by step piece by piece
5738457 police investigating themselves is not fair to police not fair to mr johnston and not fair to the tasmanian community
5738458 perfectly happy with the conduct of the investigation to date
5738459 there was no evidence of this in aggregate wages data to date
5738460 clear evidence of that decline of inflation beginning however was unlikely to be seen for a while yet
5738461 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted
5738462 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5738463 the business surveys dont show any breakout in wages and there is no general sense of that
5738464 the private sector wage numbers released after the meeting showed that wage costs are broadly still under control
5738465 most forecasts including the reserve bank would have been anticipating weak growth this year in europe and japan but not an outright contraction
5738466 it is hard to see any industrialised country that has escaped the fall out from the credit crunch and is not experiencing a sharp slowdown
5738467 you should be speaking to someone who was closer to it
5738468 it is understandable that advocates sometimes get so focused on the main point of their argument that they lose sight of the fact that a completely different angle should be considered and addressed
5738469 o orgulho do av era recortar o jornal para guardar as not cias sobre o neto
5738470 first of all she must respect me and she must know her position
5738471 but we would not be getting too far ahead of the rest of the world
5738472 in fact we would still have the toughest scheme in the world because even the european union only proposes to auction 20 per cent of its permits in the ninth year of its schemes operation
5738473 auctioning only 20 per cent of permits would repeat the big mistake made by the european union when they started which was to give away permits allowing the big polluters to take windfall gains by passing on the carbon price for which they were already being fully compensated
5738474 that system is just going to create an enormous lobbying fight to get into the boat for the free permits
5738475 its going to be enormously difficult for the government to maintain the integrity of their scheme
5738476 we also think they are proposing to use an extremely crude filter with that formula to determine which companies get compensation because they are making a judgment based on revenue rather than based on a companys margins so they are not looking at a companys capacity to pay and they are making that judgment based on a few years prices which happen to be at the absolute top of the commodity cycle
5738477 there is a growing recognition in the government that they need to make haste slowly
5738478 inconsistencies and distortions not seen in public policy since the debate about gst on food
5738479 in the eu they gave windfall profits to the polluters who passed on higher prices anyway
5738480 the cdpp accepts that dr haneef was charged following advice given by the cdpp
5738481 a number of weaknesses in the case and deficiencies in the evidence gathered to date
5738482 the cdpp brisbane case officer has said that he felt an unspoken but extreme pressure to provide positive reassurance to police that they were lawfully entitled to charge dr haneef in circumstances where he would normally refrain from providing advice
5738483 mr keelty indicated that he did not think that at that stage of the investigation that there was a case against dr haneef but that if sufficient evidence was obtained the afp would want to move quickly on the matter
5738484 the afp commissioner later stated to the media that he expressed the opinion to the former director that he didnt think that the evidence was strong enough
5738485 this important change was discernible from the briefing paper however this change was not otherwise drawn to the cdpp officers collective attention and went unnoticed by the cdpp officers
5738486 it seems the dpp were provided with incomplete selective and misleading information the afp showed disregard for the proper ground rule for obtaining legal advice
5738487 the cdpp officers had not seen any of these documents previously
5738488 the great and continuing challenge represented by the threat to democracy in fiji
5738489 it is absolutely regrettable that the leader of fiji has decided not to attend
5738490 the reasons for not attending which have been provided are simply not persuasive
5738491 we in the south pacific and pacific island countries in particular take democracy seriously
5738492 sit idly by while the principles of democracy are shredded
5738493 there is no reasonable excuse at all for fiji not attending the forum
5738494 i personally intervened to ensure that travel visas were available for the fiji delegation to go through auckland airport to niue so they could be accountable to forum leaders for commitments given last year
5738495 very disappointed that the fiji interim government has determined not to be represented for reasons which can only be described as spurious
5738496 my fathers mother was born in dundee and so i was aware that i could play for scotland
5738497 but it was a big surprise when i heard i had been called up i thought it was a bit of a wind up i had only played one game for derby
5738498 however as soon as scotland came calling it was a very easy decision to get myself up here as soon as possible
5738499 it is an exciting time for me from playing league one football with forest last season this is a completely different end of the scale
5738500 ive done well for derby in the last couple of games and i will keep pushing on from there
5738501 but as far as international football is concerned i havent had a taste of that in any age group so its going to be a whole new test for me
5738502 but its an opportunity im going to thrive on and i will try to show everyone what i can do because there are a lot of people who obviously havent heard of me
5738503 ive got a good left foot and the ability to take on players so im more of an entertaining player than a player who plays in a defensive role
5738504 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
5738505 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it
5738506 i just hope i broke up the burglary ring because they have been hitting a lot of places around here
5738507 we were conservative about how the sales volume would be but its almost been effortless
5738508 people are so hysterical about kids and sex and some articles made it seem like we were opening a kid friendly sex shop
5738509 one person came in with a 7 year old girl and my staff was like you know what kind of store this is right its a parenting issue though and we turn away minors who come in without their parents
5738510 intends to support the territorial integrity independence and sovereignty of georgia
5738511 a new line in europe where russia somehow asserts that there are those who cannot opt for a trans atlantic future is unacceptable
5738512 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5738513 assist georgia a valued and long standing partner of nato to assess the damage caused by russias military action and help restore critical services
5738514 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
5738515 when i was left out of the wales squad i was gutted
5738516 i want to be playing for wales scoring goals and doing well i want to make my mark
5738517 but really what happened was caused by what happened at derby i was not playing there and there was a knock on effect
5738518 the move to forest has lifted a huge weight from my shoulders it was made difficult for me at derby impossible really
5738519 i felt i was never going to be allowed to do well so i needed to move and i have done that
5738520 i felt i was not going to get a chance i was left sitting and watching and thinking there must be more than football causing the problem
5738521 i was trying my best to do well but i knew after the first few months that i needed to move
5738522 i felt i should have been playing scoring goals and doing well but i was not on the pitch to be allowed to do that
5738523 sometimes people just do not fit in and will be gone soon that is how it was at derby for me i knew i had to move on
5738524 then someone was prepared to pay good money for me and that gave me a hell of a lift
5738525 as soon as forest got promoted they were prepared to spend the money and i was told i was their number one choice
5738526 even at the end at derby i got the chance to say goodbye to the fans in the right way i played against arsenal late in the season and scored a goal that really pleased me
5738527 the fans at derby were brilliant to me and when i got that goal against one of the best teams in the country i was saying to them this is what i can do
5738528 this is what i am about it was a farewell and i wanted to finish off on a high against one of the best teams i could then move on
5738529 i never thought that wales would not happen again for me i felt hard done by and decided just to keep going and hope for a change
5738530 it was really all about moving club basically leaving derby the last month has been brilliant for me i have enjoyed my time at nottingham forest a very good club and a very good manager colin calderwood
5738531 all of a sudden things have changed around in just a few months for me
5738532 i want to do well for wales again i am 27 now and want to be playing until my late 30s like kevin phillips dion dublin and teddy sheringham
5738533 so for me this is the beginning of the second half of my career now i have got to do well and enjoy things
5738534 i have to prove something to john toshack if i do well then i believe i can stay in the squad
5738535 i feel refreshed ive had a good season and am really enjoying life again
5738536 it is not doom and gloom any more i feel like a new flower it was a massive shock to be left out by wales i had to look a few times at the squad to believe it
5738537 but it made me think about making decisions about my career where i was going and the need to move on i am just happy to be back involved
5738538 my club career needed to be sorted out and then came the axe from wales and i was gutted really shocked
5738539 if i do well for wales it will help me at forest i need to be consistent now for club and country and i have to make it impossible to leave me out
5738540 it was disappointing to be left out ive always wanted to play for wales and its not nice when your dreams taken away
5738541 i had a fantastic record early on in my wales career if i want that to carry on i have to be out playing
5738542 im looking forward to the future im feeling fresh excited about football
5738543 i feel the problems have all been down to a bad move to derby thats how football goes
5738544 first of all they proposed a confidential settlement and i said no way
5738545 they have been deceiving me deceiving the public deceiving the prime minister i said i will take this much 55 million and not a cent less
5738546 currently cesarin says that he claims he made the recall decision on april 27 we propose to submit he did not make the recall decision
5738547 it was made at the very latest the 24th april and it was made by mr terry slater
5738548 it means in relation to mr cesarin if he is giving evidence firstly we will ask that the whole of his evidence between the critical dates all of that evidence between paragraphs 94 and 150 of his affidavit should be given orally because it must be subjected to the closest scrutiny it just cant be right secondly and its perhaps a matter for the commonwealth but we at least raise that mr cesarin ought to be given the opportunity of a certificate because the logic of our submission will be that the recall instruments he created were false instruments and he should be given i mean he should given that opportunity
5738549 the products that are actually listed in the report were all satisfied that theres no imminent risk we have consensus on that one
5738550 you didnt want to give them natural justice for reasons we have been over amply because they might tie you up in the courts

5738587 eu subi para cabecear e me choquei com ele cai no ch o e tive um apag o mas os m dicos conseguiram me reanimar e eu ainda voltei para o jogo quando fui para o vesti rio comecei a ver estrelar e juntamente com o m dico achamos melhor deixar o campo

5738687 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18

5738691 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5738692 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5738693 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5738694 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5738695 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5738696 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5738697 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children

5738717 one thing that i think makes all of these photographs interesting is that these models all have the confidence to get in front of a camera and give it their best and on top of all that let me into their homes so i can capture them in what should be their most comfortable place in the world but often this translated into a very vulnerable appearance i specifically contacted only models that had done only one or two shoots and sometimes no prior shoots i wanted to capture them in the very beginning of their efforts to realize their dreams every aspiring model also has some sort of notion of how a professional model should pose in front of the camera but actually getting your body to do that does not translate well on the first or second shoot professional models are professional models for a reason theyve had the experience to simply know what to do and how to pose i provided very minimal to sometimes no direction for poses in these shoots i wanted the poses undeveloped and immature to document a sort of tension between their dreams and reality
5738718 concern about the increasing use of identity based electronic information systems and the frequent use of surveillance cameras is one of the impulses for desiree palmen to create her work which uses camouflage as its main focus in photo works videos and site specific actions she explores the possibilities of letting people dissolve into their surroundings or to let them disappear against the background the manipulation of clothing plays a crucial role a shirt covers the body and then extends to cover the tabletop confusing the contour of the body of the person wearing the shirt with the table itself in another work a suit is painted in such a way that when the model is in a very specific position he she disappears into the background palmen then takes pictures of these situations she creates from the ideal viewing perspective for her audience in the actual situation if the viewer moved one step away from this ideal view then the function of the camouflage seizes to exist in recent work she looks more specifically at the social implications of surveillance as she attempts to mislead the eye of big brother beginning from the perspective of police installed cameras in so called dangerous streets of rotterdam she then creates camouflage that models wear while performing actions in the street the models become invisible for the target audience the surveillance personnel while also attracting the awareness of people passing by in her photo and video work she uses the same surveying methods of the security systems as she reveals that being visible and invisible are both aspects of the same oppressive phenomenon
5738719 cinemascapes are a hybrid between autobiography and fiction with hobson himself always in the star role they are at times haunting and scandalous other times inspiring but always come across as closely personal reflective of his 30 years of experiences emotions and challenges throughout his life hobson creates cinemascapes that not only viscerally and visually grab the conscious mind but also linger in the viewers imagination and memory creating panoramics from 4 5 sequential vertical images allows the viewers eye to explore shifting focal planes and become immersed into a scene full of unsuspecting details and hidden plots more than a single frame could suffice each image seemingly captures a moment in time that poses many questions not the least of which is whats going on here
5738720 despite the gloss put on it by trinity mirror todays announcement represents a massive blow to journalism in the midlands
5738721 the nuj condemns these cuts which will inevitably hit these papers and the communities they serve hard lets be clear trinity mirror is cutting back on quality at its newspapers in pursuit of short term share price driven goals it just goes to show how little the company values its readers in comparison to the demands of the city
5738722 whatever the company may claim you simply cant take dozens of journalists out of your local operations and continue to report news to the same standard bosses at the company are sacrificing quality journalism to appease the short term whims of the financial markets
5738723 this is a deeply uncertain time for journalists working across all the titles affected its also a very bad day for people in the midlands who genuinely care about their community

5738727 whenever people think about learning to play an instrument they focus on the instrument and theres a lot more to playing an instrument than just the instrument my brothers started me playing well before three the same way a child learns to speak a language like english youre learning to speak long before three if you couldnt speak by the time youre three youre considered slow and we know that theres a problem so musics really not that much different its just the physicality of the instrument by the time you get there
5738728 in english you learn to talk first and then learn the rules later and we also understand that to learn to speak english well you cant reverse that process you cant learn the rules first and learn to speak later the rules dont make sense until you can speak but a lot of people start out in music trying to learn to read it and to me that just doesnt make sense

5738733 the u s led economic downturn shows no sign of causing a recession in it spending
5738734 in subsequent years we will see reduced growth but the fundamentals remain strong emerging regions replacement of obsolete systems and some technology shifts are driving growth
5738735 organizations are switching from company owned hardware and software assets to per use service based models this will impact the industry in various ways
5738736 the projected shift to cloud computing for example will result in dramatic growth in it products in some areas and in significant reductions in other areas in general assets will be utilized with greater efficiency and we are assuming that the overall effect on market growth will be neutral we also recognize that there is considerable upside potential for higher growth
5738737 most companies updated their software systems during the period 1997 through 2001 so we are in the middle of an upgrade cycle that should extend past the end of this decade
5738738 however the replacement of systems does not automatically equate to new software market growth software as a service saas cloud computing service oriented architecture soa web 2 0 and open source software are causing huge changes to the software market many of these factors are impacting market growth as enterprises replace assets with per use services
5738739 legacy telecom services have a dampening effect on sector growth and therefore on the overall it market
5738740 the dominant size of the telecom services market guarantees that even with the forecast for relatively slow growth it will still comprise over 44 of the it market in five years time
5738741 spending in it services is being supported by two main factors
5738742 businesses are investing in improvements to internal processes aimed at reducing costs while often maintaining some of the prior interest in innovation the second factor is that globalization allows it services providers to mitigate the risk of weakening demand by operating in more markets

5738795 as far as what sensitives have picked up about the skull some people felt the skull was very young or newly created other people felt that it was a projection of some spiritual entity into our world which might explain why its form is so strange others felt that the shape was solidified from some type of liquid and then others felt the skull had a connection with the inner earth

5738821 the sewage has no border and has spread right along our coastline
5738822 since sanctions it is very difficult to get the ingredients i need
5738823 we have had to cut production drastically to keep going
5738824 i thought things would improve with the ceasefire and that more things would be allowed into gaza but nothing changed nothing changed at all
5738825 any elected official or civil servant who is involved in the forgery of public documents shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of five to fifteen years
5738826 the shares in question were not disposed in fact it was a grant in connection with a new position and drawing a comparison at all to lyors sale is completely wrong if you look in the filing for our new head of global human resources warning pdf link youll see in box 4 in table 2 that it states that this was a grant
5738827 lets have this old guy sing songs hes clearly not familiar with
5738828 and although he has his moments of sentimentality on john lennons grow old with me and the velvet undergrounds jesus campbell is still a formidable interpreter of song who even overcomes heavy handed production to remind us why he was always our favorite charismatic pop music cowboy
5738829 much like johnny cashs late in life work with producer rick rubin these are serious recordings where campbell locates the emotional thread in meaningful lyrics from those with different backgrounds than his the best cuts his takes on jackson brownes these days u2s all i want is you and john lennons grow old with me own a timeless beauty that bridges generations and cultures
5738830 overall the tracks couldve benefited from less showy musicianship in favor of a naked spotlight on campbells world weary perspective certainly at age 72 campbell has earned the right to just sing it as he sees it
5738831 he has picked well written and age appropriate songs jackson brownes weary reflection these days composed in the late 60s when the songwriter was a teenager seems more relevant and moving coming from a 72 year old with a lived in voice even better the replacements wistful sadly beautiful about a father watching his child mature has a perfect foil in campbell
5738832 johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
5738833 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt
5738834 we have enjoyed a healthy pace of orders since the start of the current fiscal year from a broad spectrum of industries
5738835 while we are making a lot of improvements the mobileme service is still not up to our standards we are extending subscriptions 60 days free of charge to express appreciation for our members patience as we continue to improve the service
5738836 partnering with boomi makes sense for centive and our customers
5738837 we both have award winning native saas technologies that are considered best in class and we both believe that saas offerings are the future of business applications boomi proved they could meet our demands for performance and ease of use and boomi on demand easily handled our toughest high volume data transformation projects the saas industry is challenging traditional thinking about technology and boomi is redefining how we should all think about integration it should be easy affordable and fast
5738838 most companies face a difficult choice when implementing a saas application into an enterprise environment namely having to choose between conventional integration products and appliances or creating custom code to tie the application into other data sources both options are expensive especially in relation to the economics of the saas industry boomi offers a saas solution for saas integration
5738839 its affordable powerful scalable and easy to use the exact attributes saas savvy isvs and customers are looking for
5738840 i am most enthused by the reports description of the hill zone
5738841 the hill zone was discovered as a part of the ongoing integration of current drill and analytical data with the historic geologic geochemical and mining data
5738842 we have drilled approximately 40 of the property every historical drill hole as well as all of the companys drilling has encountered mineralized material the geometry of which suggests to me that the identified near surface oxidized mineralization should be amenable to mining by open pit methods and potentially recoverable by low cost heap leach processing
5738843 we intend to continue developing the potential economic potential of this property by continuing to drill the property completing a canadian national instrument 43 101 compliant resource calculation and bringing this substantial property into production as soon as permitting will allow to that end we have approved a budget of 600 000 which will produce the reports and the permits
5738844 this win is a huge source of satisfaction for both me and my team
5738845 in the absence of my key rivals michal kosciuszko jaan molder and patrik sandell who didnt nominate this round it was vital for me to take as many points as possible here in order to claim the advantage in the junior world rally championship
5738846 the rally went well for us but i would have preferred to have continued our duel with martin prokop all the way to the finish
5738847 at the start of the rally i saw straight away that i could more or less match his times so i chose him as my reference point luckily i was then able to find the right pace on these very quick stages and maintain it all the way to the end at the porta nigra in trier i look forward to catalunya now its a new event for me but ill have to fight and stay in front of my rivals to win the championship

5738866 the market approval for thailand is a further step in expanding the commercial potential of cardimas products worldwide and is also another significant stride in achieving our ongoing regulatory strategy
5738867 thailand is an excellent market for cardima because of its advanced medical infrastructure and highly trained physicians cardima is working closely with dr li poa of columbia university medical school and meds global healthcare usa in conjunction with mahidol university and the thailand ministry of health to position cardimas products to play a key role in establishing centers of excellence in thailand for the treatment of atrial fibrillation
5738868 meds global healthcare is working closely with mahidol university and the thailand ministry of public health to establish several atrial fibrillation centers of excellence in thailand leading thai medical centers now treat over 1 million tourist patients every year thailand wants to leverage their success in this market by focusing on key disease sectors atrial fibrillation represents a huge global market with millions of untreated patients meds global healthcare has identified atrial fibrillation as a problem requiring treatment resources that cannot currently be provided at adequate levels or at a reasonable cost in most if not all developed countries
5738869 we are very excited to be working with cardima dr li poa and the physicians at ramathibodi hospital on this important initiative
5738870 we have had great results working with the cardima minimally invasive surgical ablation system i am excited to introduce this new treatment option to thailand as part of the program developing af centers of excellence working with meds global healthcare ramathibodi hospital leading thai physicians and the thai ministry of public health atrial fibrillation is a very large public health issue globally with millions of patients going untreated every year frustrating both patients and physicians treatment utilizing cardimas solutions needs to be made available to patients we hope that through the development of these centers of excellence in thailand patients globally will have one more option in accessing treatment i have worked with many technologies and products to treat af but our first choice for training and patient treatment in thailand will be cardimas
5738871 as a physician to sufferers of critical limb ischemia i am extremely proud to be involved in developing therapeutic applications using the erc cell if approved by the fda we may one day provide this patient population with an option to amputation
5738872 since the normal function of the erc in a womans body is to generate new blood vessels on a monthly basis it is logical that these cells would generate new blood vessels in limbs that suffer from poor circulation and our current studies support this
5738873 given that dr murphy has experience with therapeutic applications for stem cells in critical limb ischemia we are honored to have him lead these studies which will be a key component in an upcoming submission to the fda

5738897 from a financial perspective we are pleased to have acquired version3 via an equity transaction by issuing csi stock at what we believe is an attractive multiple
5738898 we mitigated the impact of dilution to csi shareholders by placing a portion of these shares in escrow for release over the next three years as version3 achieves its performance targets

5738914 due to its oral activity and plausible long term durable response rate seen in ra patients in the initial multi center placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial oral dnajp1 may have an important clinical advantage over current injectable ra treatments which have significant toxicities our preliminary studies also strongly suggest that the mechanism of action of dnajp1 is complementary to current biologics thus providing the opportunity to develop combination therapies which may improve currently used regimens the long term statistically significant improvement in clinical scores as seen by acr20 and acr50 following cessation of drug therapy further suggests that this technology may be inducing a tolerogenic response
5738915 we are pleased to have broadened our therapeutic pipeline of products with the acquisition of this innovative program oral dnajp1 certainly complements our existing clinical stage immunology programs which include trimesta our oral phase ii iii clinical program in multiple sclerosis and our cd4 inhibitor technology we have been equally impressed with the rigor and quality of the scientific data along with the level of grant funding this program has received over the years from the nih we look forward to reporting additional clinical data from this study later this year

5738978 the russian offensive against and in georgia is an act of aggression that is incompatible with international law and fundamental principles of security and cooperation in europe
5738979 we and russia will have to live with the consequences of russias use of force for a long time to come
5738980 the justification given by russia is that it is protecting russian nationals but the obligation to protect people irrespective of their nationality lies with the state in which those individuals are located
5738981 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and that is why it is so important that this doctrine is emphatically dismissed the same doctrine can be equally dangerous in other situations

5739005 whatever the underlying determinants if we continue to experience widespread uncontrolled outbreaks of h5n1 in poultry the appearance of strains well adapted to human beings might just be matter of time
5739006 the virus isolated had no changes to indicate adaptation to human infection
5739007 there is no indication from this data that we are any nearer a pandemic
5739008 the business is flourishing and there is a good reason for dreamworks to be hiring so many people
5739009 in the film industry linux has won its running on practically all servers and desktops used for feature animation and visual effects
5739010 you have to be very careful not to rely on a single tool u2013 and this is another thing that i share a passion for with peter jackson
5739011 we need to keep that art form alive because it brings a textural power to the movie that ultimately affects the content the creatures somehow seem more tactile and more tangible than cg
5739012 i think that some creatures are better served by being completely cg and others are better served by being completely animatronic u2013 and others are only possible if you mix the two
5739013 absolutely i think that it worked perfectly on the lord of the rings trilogy and if it aint broke why fix it
5739014 we will complete animation on coraline in about six weeks and plan a february release of 2009
5739015 it concerns itself with a primal thought every child considers i wish i had other parents that and the button eyes
5739016 the movie version of coraline is very faithful to the tone and the spirit of the book
5739017 in the translation from book to film there are adjustments to story and character that have to be made the main thing i always felt was i could not disappoint the readers of the book and though some details have been changed as well as the order of the sequences i feel we will be successful
5739018 there is no doubt that there are some similarities between the two projects
5739019 i also have many of the original nightmare team members working on coraline weve all grown and the visual aesthetic is ultimately a very different one youll see great animation like nightmare like a cousin of nightmare more like a second cousin the last thing id want to do would be to try to rip off a classic film i directed
5739020 it just gives you more of what is there just a little more sense of the reality of this medium

5739023 mr 33cms real name is based off of weather as well
5739024 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
5739025 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
5739026 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
5739027 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile
5739028 there came a point where animators were trying to create a face and there was a theory of diminishing returns
5739029 if youre trying to process the graphics in a photo realistic animation in real time theres a lot of computation involved
5739030 fixed constraints are shown in cyan sliding constraints in green and surface constraints in maroon surface constraints allow the strands to move axially as well as laterally the input animation target is shown in wireframe
5739031 strands are shown in blue and constraints are shown in green

5739040 sasisekharans team has changed our view of flu viruses and how they must adapt to infect us
5739041 the work may also improve our ability to monitor the evolution of the h5n1 virus and thwart potential outbreaks
5739042 this new work shows that there are sublevels of sugar that the virus prefers to use to get into cells and the authors suggest this is a significant factor in why h5n1 has not yet spread to humans
5739043 email archiving is clearly proving its worth and we are delighted to see its uptake so pervasive and successful and especially that only 1 of the people we surveyed reported any negative experiences or attitudes towards email compliance however while the lack of appreciation of its utility is concerning what is perhaps more alarming is the relatively widespread assumption that email archiving is not important or necessary to the business
5739044 wherever email is the principal form of communication within the business email archiving is essential too many businesses fail to realise that each email communication sent or received is probably the only record they have of important transactions with a customer or between members of staff according to osterman research email contains nearly 75 of the information that individuals use on a daily basis making the sheer amount of corporate knowledge stored in email enough to justify its safekeeping over long periods of time
5739045 email archiving is a function that should run through all company departments obviously storage backups problematic and corrupt pst files overloaded email servers and performance are the it departments major concerns while the legal team sees email as an essential factor in its discovery disclosure and due diligence strategies indeed most of our respondents who have implemented email archiving are doing so for compliance or for ensuring they have a full paper trail should there be any form of investigation and of course email archives boost overall productivity for employees company wide when the need arises to access their email from anywhere in the world with such a high proportion of companies already seeing the benefits of email archiving educating the remainder of the necessity and advantages of the process is essential

5739064 there are some times i still want to hit before i retire
5739065 and i want to try some new events thats whats keeping me going
5739066 i am going to london to do the handover for the next olympics
5739067 and hopefully prepare myself the way i did for these games and be ready to compete in london
5739068 will continue to remain committed to a provider network of independent private practice optometry in the u s
5739069 supply and support its brands and services to its total customer base of quality retailers including independent opticians optometrists ophthalmologists and chains around the world
5739070 everything we do is in support of our doctor network to ensure that they have high quality choices
5739071 we think this is a tremendous combination which creates the potential for an integrated platform for eyecare delivery its going to preserve choice for our doctors and give them a vehicle if they want to take advantage of it to be more competitive at same time each of our businesses will function independently
5739072 vsp has for a long time been in the materials business and the lab business and certainly prior to eyefinity was in the practice solutions business from the claims processing area we needed to get larger in some of those businesses so our doctors continue to have high quality choice we started to look around the industry i was relatively new to the business but one of the first names i heard was al bergs we first met about a year ago and found we had a good personal rapport but also came to see that culturally we were very similar companies marchon has been in business for over 25 years us for 53 years both focus on providing operational excellence in our business lines both organizations take pride in the fact that they are recognized as best in class from a service standpoint we both have a number of long term service executives who are high performers and feel passionately about the businesses they support and marchon had made an investment to build out its business globally and weve made the decision to do the same
5739073 we had been looking at a variety of long term options were an excellent company with great people very successful but weve seen the changing marketplace and the changing position of our competitors we ourselves had done a list of companies wed consider working with and vsp was on the short list wed known them from the outside they had an excellent reputation and vsp was changing as rob came into the picture we spent a lot of time learning about each others organizations and as we talked it became clear that if the two of us decided this was the right answer it would be a great combination
5739074 in terms of the managed vision business one of the things marchon can do is help us take our business globally as its own business line we feel strongly that our network supports the broader health care continuum provides access to health care and focuses on wellness by contracting with us employers can see a reduction in their health care costs
5739075 continues to be how to strengthen the retailers that support marchon we learned we have a tremendous overlap in the u s with the independent optometrist in looking at ways to make every customer a better businessman including the independent od we saw we could do a tremendous job in terms of the efficiencies of his or her operations we need a very strong customer base that can compete with the largest group in the u s
5739076 we dont think its necessary that we add a chain our base network today has 25 000 private practice doctors weve been growing by about 1 000 doctors a year and expect that to continue when we take a look at where vsp patients go to access care our out of network is less than 2 percent when we look at different geographics around the world where care is distributed differently than in the u s we would look to work with private practices and examine those systems
5739077 managed care per se doesnt really exist outside the u s
5739078 vsp has always been domiciled in sacramento and now well have two executive offices one there and another in melville n y
5739079 we have partner relations with almost every participant in the industry and we hope none of these partnerships will change we hope theyll all continue
5739080 for the future the processing of businesses b to b is going to be critical to business success
5739081 im personally a big supporter of visionweb im proud of what weve done to support them and were optimistic that both portals are of benefit to the industry
5739082 it would be great if we could somehow get eyefinity and visionweb to work together any portal that allows for the ease of transacting is a benefit to doctors
5739083 they have an interesting business model a large part of which has been a consignment model which is very successful our plan at marchon is to continue to use our own business model for all of our brands but we can learn from them and they can learn from us altair will be another division of marchon we can consider taking some of those brands internationally and with our design teams and production sources there are many ways we can help grow that business
5739084 we are absolutely committed to the contract lab system but have been looking to have a broader presence with partnerships or owning our own labs this is separate from the marchon acquisition but wed be interested in having a geographic lab presence in the northeast
5739085 its a benefit for marchon that vsp owns some labs not because well be running a lab business extensively but for marchon to ultimately to do the best job for its customers we need to learn more about the labs how we transmit information create efficiencies for customers this deal gives us the opportunity to better study that situation and possibly better improve service levels in the industry as a result
5739086 this is a great industry and with this announcement the industry has gotten a whole lot healthier the acquisition will strengthen marchon by giving us resources we didnt have expand our offerings and frankly better defend our business were a successful privately held company this is a new chapter for all of our employees and sales people not one person is negatively affected by this change we will make sure that the customers of marchon and vsps providers will have every opportunity to be successful in this business

5739094 to your descendants through isaac i give this land from the river of egypt to the great river the euphrates
5739095 im not sure i might have to go look it up in a book
5739096 oh no no this is a fifth generation of blah blah blah medicine it will be fine
5739097 well its not the medicine if it was it would have spread all over and see its just on your arms
5739098 there are no changes in the regulations of passing borders between azerbaijan and russia
5739099 measures to prevent penetration of the members of foreign terrorist organizations to the territory of russia and also to prevent import of weapon and means of diversion in the established checkpoints through the state border of the russian federation
5739100 it seems to me that nato is trying to make an aggressor out of a victim to whitewash a criminal regime to rescue a chaotic regime and is on the road towards rearming the current georgian leadership
5739101 the house of the dead overkill mejor portada de la historia
5739102 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5739103 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5739104 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5739105 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5739106 suite un contr le de police le journaliste tunisien slim boukhdir a recouvr sa libert le 21 juillet dernier
5739107 der knackpunkt war im special das hat er nicht vergessen es ist eine schande denn er war in gro artiger form
5739108 aber so ist das leben bis dahin war es seine bisher beste k r
5739109 ich bin nicht mehr volles risiko gegangen als ich das ergebnis von isabell geh rt hatte ich habe gedacht blo keine fehler machen
5739110 ein traum ist wahrgeworden ich hatte mir das nach athen vorgenommen
5739111 ich bin nicht mehr ganz so jung und muss mich auch um meine kinder k mmern
5739112 ich glaube nicht dass ich noch ein drittes mal so ein pferd bekomme
5739113 wenn mir irgendjemand so ein pferd schenkt berlege ich es mir vielleicht noch anders
5739114 reading about people not that much older than me who had gone to jail and suffered beatings in order to liberate a people
5739115 the ark of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice
5739116 for other people to say things like that people wouldnt take it seriously but with barack people really did take him seriously they thought of him as someone who really sincerely believed it
5739117 remember at the time in chicago the wards were really politically motivated
5739118 if you werent onboard with the political process and people in leadership then your garbage didnt get picked up on time and your street didnt get fixed
5739119 politicians understand that the number of community residents that come out for a community meeting probably represent 10 times the number of votes
5739120 it might have been small victories to the outside world but to us it was big it meant those kids could get the jobs they could buy things to start back to school
5739121 we saw what could happen we saw what can be done if the community has the resources and somebody to come in and train them ill always be grateful for that
5739122 im a lot more of a hothead than barack is
5739123 barack is more for compromise you know hell wait and see
5739124 so i would say to myself ok im not really great at the high road because the road is already crumbling ok so i dont know if i can make the road higher
5739125 this is the only area of chicago where real transportation does not run to the city limits
5739126 we have a whole community thats isolated with no way to get to jobs
5739127 with sen obamas help we wound up getting president bush to sign the transportation bill allocating 580 million for the extension of the red line train
5739128 we may someday soon have a president in the white house who will listen to people like us
5739129 then maybe finally well have someone who will respond to our needs
5739130 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5739131 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5739132 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5739133 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5739134 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5739135 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5739136 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5739137 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5739138 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5739139 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5739140 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5739141 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5739142 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5739143 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5739144 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5739145 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5739146 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5739147 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5739148 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5739149 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5739150 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5739151 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5739152 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5739153 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5739154 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5739155 a prototype from her paris hilton push up bra line
5739156 besides me being really vigilant about it the mri is the number one reason that im going to live if this had been caught a year from now or when i was 40 i probably wouldnt be able to live through this or i would have to undergo such much more than i have
5739157 its incredibly expensive so for me one of the things when this all happened was that im putting together a program to pay for mris for women who are at high risk which means women who have had it in their family or know that theyre gene positive
5739158 were also going to pay for the genetic testing because thats very very expensive its upwards of 2 000 to 3 000 so all of that is coming together right now
5739159 i watched my mother have a mastectomy and then i watched her go through two years of chemotherapy and eight surgeries and a hysterectomy ive watched this woman survive so for me there was always that sense i was going to be okay no matter what
5739160 i really love living and i really love my life and i knew from this moment on there was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5739161 yeah im going to face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been so just knowing that in my soul gave me the strength to just say i have to get out there and make this a positive
5739162 humour is everything even in the hospital there was so much laughter that was happening and actually it was sometimes good and sometimes not so good because it can actually be painful to laugh that hard but ive laughed so much in the last three weeks
5739163 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get into wallowing in self pity sometimes i think its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its okay to cry its okay to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to its okay
5739164 am liebsten w rde ich f r beide teams spielen
5739165 dass es eine gro e leistung ist f r die deutsche nationalmannschaft zu spielen
5739166 wir wollen nicht mehr dass die dogans f r deutschland auflaufen
5739167 dann waren die talente weg inzwischen hat sich das ge ndert
5739168 die wm in unserem land hat f r die identit tsentwicklung eine wichtige rolle gespielt
5739169 der weg war nur etwas l nger und etwas holpriger
5739170 ich bin gl cklich dass ich zwei tore gemacht habe aber es z hlt nur das teamwork
5739171 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5739172 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5739173 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5739174 i couldnt get the money here i couldnt get the money in britain i went to everybody the first question you get is is it a black film all of them agree its not going to do good in europe its not going to do good in japan somebody has to prove that to be a lie
5739175 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5739176 so basically i had prophylactic double mastectomies people would say three weeks ago
5739177 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me and so this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5739178 you know im going to have cute boobs when im 90 so you know theres that im going to have the best boobs in the nursing home im telling you im going to be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5739179 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5739180 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5739181 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5739182 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5739183 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5739184 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5739186 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5739187 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5739188 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5739189 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5739190 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5739191 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5739192 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5739193 wenn die technik stimmt dann kann ich bestleistung werfen aber da muss alles passen

5739202 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5739203 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5739204 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5739205 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

5739208 we actually know very little about possums their needs requirements numbers how they use our shared space and why
5739209 its very difficult to gain information on the ecology of animals that live in suburbia you cant track them through peoples back yards so in order to find out more we need the involvement of the community
5739210 were looking into the distribution of possums how people manage possums and were looking into peoples opinions of possums
5739211 we want people to do the survey even if they havent seen a possum
5739212 the rah bed capacity is at crisis and impacting on the ability to maintain safe and efficient patient care
5739213 expedite patient discharges cancel non urgent messages and prioritise transfers
5739214 the hospital did call a code white on august 11 2008 as it became very busy
5739215 reassure people that at all times the safety of patients is the most important consideration
5739216 these situations arise very rarely at the rah but our demand management procedures are in place to ensure that staff are aware that patients who are ready to go home should be discharged in a timely manner in order to free up beds for patients awaiting admission
5739217 the hospital quickly returned to normal operation with staff managing the demand that day and ensuring all patients were treated appropriately
5739218 i want to reassure the community that the hospital is functioning well despite the higher winter demand and that at all times patient safety is our priority
5739219 currently all public hospital intensive care units for example are full to point of overflowing
5739220 the rah is hoping for a quiet night tonight because if they have a busy night then they wont be able to cope tomorrow and will have to start cancelling elective surgeries
5739221 weve called for an increase of 10 per cent in hospital bed numbers for south australia and even the proposed new marjorie jackson nelson hospital is not going to achieve that
5739222 most people are aware our hospitals are busy over winter
5739223 and thats why every winter we open up new beds and employ more staff through our winter demand strategy
5739224 a case of a hospital dealing with an increase in demand and now the situation has been resolved
5739225 caesar going out telling everyone hes won the war while rome is burning
5739226 i dont want anything to do with this industry it absolutely stinks im gonna go out having told the truth and with my head held high and having stood for something
5739227 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of
5739228 its all done for profit and not for any degree of musical feeling or sentiment and the press distort things to such a degree that youve not got a hope of knowing what the truth is so its not something that i want to participate in or fuel anymore
5739229 it makes me tired and it makes me feel ill and i dont want anything more to do with it
5739230 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5739231 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5739232 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5739233 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5739234 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5739235 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5739236 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5739237 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5739238 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5739239 wenigstens wir wollten die deutsche fahne hochhalten irgendeiner musste die serie doch durchbrechen

5739243 we do not have a huge presence in china or the pacific rim
5739244 as a b to c company we have to have a better understanding of what our end users are using
5739245 the company seems to have an uncanny ability to understand its users and read the market right they come out with so many new products that its just phenomenal
5739246 they provide customers with more and for most of the stuff you dont pay
5739247 its sort of a wining proposition no matter how they do it the more content google provides the higher the likelihood that their customers will be more satisfied
5739248 all of the talk that yahoo and microsoft cannot do search on their own is not helping either of them in terms of a consumers perspective
5739249 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5739250 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

5739252 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5739253 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5739254 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5739255 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5739256 we havent seen anything like this before where a company scores 10 points over its nearest rival
5739257 there was a question mark last year about apple that maybe it had taken its eye off the ball by concentrating on the iphone but now the iphone and ipod and mac are nicely aligned
5739258 most of apples windows based competition is suffering a bit from vista
5739259 complaints about vista are generating complaints about the computer makers
5739260 people know there have been some service and product quality problems but apple has an almost teflon like quality its problems dont really seem to matter to consumers
5739261 most lose it slowly like dell has which took a while and we see companies improve but apples extreme volatility is almost like its stock price
5739262 apple will be very difficult to catch but i dont think that these results where theres a 10 point difference will hold
5739263 my guess is that they will regroup at some point and come back
5739264 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5739265 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5739266 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5739267 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5739268 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5739269 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5739270 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5739271 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5739272 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5739273 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5739274 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5739275 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5739276 emi has the publishing rights to some of the greatest most beloved songs ever written and performed and we are truly delighted to be able to share them with our community
5739277 in the past music fans have had to rely on user generated lyrics posted on the internet that were often inaccurate or incomplete this partnership helps create one of the largest repositories for official lyrics as written by the songwriters
5739278 logic said it could happen but the hard part is getting it on the day when it really counts
5739279 i try to go into a race with the frame of mind that i couldnt have trained harder whatever happens then is out of your hands
5739280 hes my sporting hero and i get to train with him nearly every day how lucky am i
5739281 i would be very surprised if people were doubting us
5739282 weve stepped up to a whole new level since the world championships but there are reasons for that
5739283 it seems more surprising that some nations have underperformed the gap has been exaggerated by some nations that havent raised their game
5739284 its sad that any sporting achievement in this modern era is questioned
5739285 der einfache grund war veltins hatte eine reine gastro flasche

5739297 the mobile news market in the us will soon be ripe for mass consumption according to robert samuels director of mobile products mobile web messaging games and alternative platforms at the new york times
5739298 recently the newspaper association of america naa released its development guide for mobile sites this guide covers mobile content revenue and a few case studies
5739299 we just love the lifestyle the real sense of community in the area and the availability of services
5739300 the children all play together we know our neighbours we dont have to go to a bottle shop to buy a bottle of wine because we can go to our local cellar door and we can buy fresh strawberries from the farm gate
5739301 theres also a real sense that when you get through the heysen tunnels you take a deep breath and it doesnt matter what kind of day youve had it feels like home
5739302 flat rates are good from the customers point of view you need to have an idea of how much you will pay at the end of the month so if you are paying in terms of megabyte downloads you really dont know how many megabytes the pages you are visiting weigh or the mails you are receiving or sending
5739303 you also dont know if you are paying for the time or not it depends on the operator
5739304 i hear from operators that 3 of their customer base use a lot of ev do for videos etc and the amount of gigs they process is incredible
5739305 it is very easy to identify them so they go directly to them and say what do you need to keep working in that way without destroying my network pay for what youre using and not taking advantage of unlimited flat rates
5739306 only with the introduction of the added capacity of rev a have operators like lg telecom been able to start thinking of offering flat rate data plans
5739307 the problem is that operators are trying to increase their broadband customers over hspa or ev do in the process the likelihood of offering good mobile tv using unicast will get worse and worse
5739308 we still havent decided how much the increase in output will be but it will be enough to supply the wood panel market which is growing at 7 a year
5739309 for 10 years while ive been training ive always had the games in a corner of my mind
5739310 thats a lot of sacrifices hours of training of being away from my family
5739311 in the semifinal bourgain had been matched against hoy but after being defeated in the first of the three match series had decided to settle for bronze
5739312 weve come up against a british team that is out of the ordinary
5739313 against hoy i gave everything i had in the first race and still he beat me
5739314 so i let it slide for the second because i knew that levy was beatable and i had a chance of bronze
5739315 france ends the track cycling with two medals bourgains bronze and the team sprint silver
5739316 i think we have got to a position where it is very difficult to do it at a level which we are used to
5739317 as far as the icc is concerned the safety and security is satisfactory
5739318 we certainly feel confident about the safety and security aspect of the tournament the onus is on us to convince all those who have different perceptions
5739319 the teams have not withdrawn and we expect the best teams to participate i would like to think the member boards would not send weakened sides because no life is lesser than another
5739320 they showed us a powerful attack and very good tactics
5739321 in terms of experience speed and technique team korea is superior to team china
5739322 those strengths all became clear in the final 15 minutes
5739323 we are very well prepared and our target is the gold medal
5739324 we played korea and beat them at the world championships last year
5739325 we want to go to the finals so we need to beat any team we play
5739326 they are specially made for me i like the color
5739327 just getting through to fight him is like a gold medal for me
5739328 wed been working on the tactics all week and tonight they were spot on
5739329 i dedicated the last two years of my life to get a medal this is the proudest moment of my life
5739330 what can i say im the luckiest girl in the world
5739331 shes officially off the market no one else gets her and now shell cook and clean for me
5739332 the love we felt from the people surrounding us and the love we have for each other made this the most beautiful and emotional day

5739338 assemblywoman mayersohn has been at odds with the aids community she has persistently promoted legislation that stigmatizes people living with and affected by hiv aids skirts civil liberties and does nothing to prevent the further spread of the disease
5739339 the states name based reporting law is a valuable tool in tracking hiv infections in a timely manner
5739340 the study provides solid evidence that the law does not deter testing
5739341 the primary advantages of this law are better epidemiologic tracing of the hiv aids epidemic and more effective partner notification to get persons exposed to hiv diagnosed and into care sooner
5739342 an assault victim is in desperate need of an easily available piece of information that can dramatically impact their lives this information is a vital factor in deciding treatment and treatment duration if there are side effects of treatment this measure provides necessary information to assault victims in our opinion the potential harm to testing a falsely accused person is minimal the potential benefit in testing a true perpetrator is immense
5739343 we at vibs victims information bureau of suffolk are very much aware of victims anxieties about sexually transmitted diseases especially hiv and aids it is a wrenching experience to choose to take hiv prophylaxis without being sure of the perpetrators hiv status victims should have the right to that information as soon as possible to prevent prolonged exposure to toxic prophylactic medications
5739344 we were conservative about how the sales volume would be but its almost been effortless
5739345 people are so hysterical about kids and sex and some articles made it seem like we were opening a kid friendly sex shop

5739400 brothers this is a very hard winter the women and children are starving and freezing if this were summer i would say to keep on fighting to the end but we cannot do this we must think of the women and children and that it is very bad for them so we must make peace and i will see that nobody is hurt by the soldiers
5739401 this years audit clearly reflects the uks continued acceptance of aesthetic surgery particularly in the area of anti ageing
5739402 wide media coverage has helped educate the public about the latest advances and choices available but it is crucial that people do their research carefully when choosing a provider
5739403 the effects of these less invasive treatments can sometimes be limited once jowling or loose skin has developed so this could explain why more patients now feel ready for the surgical option
5739404 record numbers of people across the uk are having plastic surgery
5739405 if you have an adult section you should enforce it
5739406 s ignaled the beginning of a new round of political uncertainty
5739407 with the countrys economy at an all time low and a radical islamist insurgency based in the countrys tribal areas gaining in strength the civilian coalition faces challenges that will not be easily or quickly sorted out
5739408 most pakistanis see the coalition government as the countrys last chance for democracy and they want it to work
5739409 performed poorly especially in dealing with the growing jihadist insurgency
5739410 without a strong democracy pakistan will continue to swing from civilian to military to civilian control never finding the moderate middle ground its people deserve to get the process rolling the new government needs to move quickly to show that it is competent at basic governance getting serious about fighting the war on terror is an essential first step
5739411 musharraf was the last to read the writing on the wall
5739412 although he musharraf has finally bowed out there remained no other option once both the army and the u s refused to back his bid to stay in power
5739413 both have been victims of military coups in the past and
5739414 now that the field has been cleared the alleged conspiracies that hampered governance ended it is time for the elected government to show people their ballots were not wasted the coalition partners must demonstrate they are capable of insightful leadership political wisdom and can live up to the task of guiding the country onwards along the path of progress
5739415 after musharrafs exit the ruling coalition will have to accept the responsibility of running the government because from now on it would not be able to find anyone else to shift the blame for its failures the daily times
5739416 he was in control of himself he was confident and assured neither bitter nor crowing he did not fumble even in extempore mode a remarkable achievement in view of the charged environment and subject of his speech
5739417 one ugly blowback in the post musharraf period may be
5739418 will impact what happens to pakistan politics as well as what happens to pakistans political leadership itself
5739419 musharraf came off as a man proud of his achievements a patriot who was sincere with the country this farewell speech will certainly help in remedying musharrafs lately tainted reputation
5739420 massive political vacuum and only time will tell us how effectively this is filled in the mean time
5739421 is that musharraf is out thats naturally one hurdle that needed to be crossed
5739422 zardari is in now thats one thing i mourn run for the hills the cats out of the bag
5739423 pakistan now needs to hold strong it is genuine honest pakistanis that need to get together and rebuild pakistan we cannot continue to be held hostage by corrupt leaders and dictators who walk away when they are done cleansing our country history repeats itself for the umpteenth time when our leaders get up and walk out of the country when its a sordid mess
5739424 leadership must avoid political confrontation as this time is to sacrifice many things for the nation and the country
5739425 lo mejor que podemos hacer en estas circunstancias es actuar con inteligencia y estar informados
5739426 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5739427 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5739428 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5739429 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5739430 this morning a la honda resident reported a suspicious person in the highway 35 84 area near alices restaurant
5739431 flowing slowly now because a pressing need has arisen to create new posts for peacekeepers
5739432 would stabilize the situation with uncontrolled movements of armed people
5739433 this is one of the first units to be pulled out
5739434 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
5739435 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies
5739436 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5739437 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5739438 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5739439 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5739440 signing this initiative does serious harm to the education and enforcement efforts on our campuses and ultimately endangers young lives even more
5739441 i ask every higher education leader who has signed to reconsider i am old enough to remember life on our campuses before the 21 year drinking rule it was horrible
5739442 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5739443 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5739444 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5739445 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5739446 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5739447 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5739448 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5739449 chief executive frank blake has come in and refocused the firm on its core retail operations
5739450 is reinvesting back into systems labor and merchandising and that is putting additional pressure on earnings
5739451 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5739452 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum
5739453 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5739454 georgia is not a member of nato what can nato do

5739457 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5739458 gwyneth paltrow should be ashamed i can only assume that paltrow either is ignorant of the facts or lacks human decency and compassion

5739528 i have been left feeling that my privacy has been invaded
5739529 i think it is important to take abortion out of the crimes act and thats what this legislation will give effect to
5739530 the views that have been considered in the bill are those of the abortion industry and advocates that want abortion at any cost to women
5739531 its almost like medical negligence not to have post abortion counselling
5739532 if youre telling me they want to work ill give them a go
5739533 why not ill employ anyone so long as they are willing to work
5739534 the kind of money which employers are putting up to bring them in and repatriate them would be much better invested in getting local aboriginal people a start in the local economy
5739535 the fact that weve got a substantial pool of unemployed people who are our immediate ongoing responsibility makes this an exercise in folly because obviously if any of these pacific islanders are working nearby high unemployment aboriginal towns the local people are going to feel cheated
5739536 my frustration in all this stuff is the inept failure of government to actually engage
5739537 to hear that the government are proposing to bring in more overseas workers when aboriginal people are disadvantaged in the workforce is shameful
5739538 i cant understand them importing people from other places when youve got really high unemployment in your town be it aboriginal white or what
5739539 every season we get aboriginal people here picking fruit for us
5739540 any person who comes in looking for work gets put on

5739542 if weve got a work shortage in places like cape york and theyve got a worker shortage down here we should provide the workers
5739543 if youre going to fly people from the pacific islands whats wrong with flying people from cape york for instance or karratha or melbourne or sydney or brisbane or nhulunbuy

5739694 obama at some point might be asked this question michael moore has endorsed you
5739695 so barack by denouncing me you can help mccain get elected because when you denounce me its not really me youre distancing yourself from its the millions upon millions of people who feel the same way about things as i do
5739696 why doesnt he just take out that light saber or the whip he used in his other movies
5739697 some people say humans are to blame for the confrontations and insist that no bears should be killed because of the attacks
5739698 it is pretty much unsafe to walk around at night
5739699 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
5739700 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it i was boxing him using one arm to defend one arm to strike
5739701 the only thing i can do is keep concentrating on learning the playbook which i think i have a good grasp
5739702 i didnt want to do something stupid by pushing too hard and too early
5739703 the downside of him playing too early would be pushing it and having a setback and not having him available for the first game of the season sept 7 against
5739704 he gives us some experience and versatility and can play either free or strong safety
5739705 hes in pretty good shape although he hasnt been a starter the past two seasons

5739707 the white house and the nfl now have many more reporters covering them than in the old days theyll report how you conduct your life
5739708 looking at it from a fans point of view id probably boo myself to
5739709 the fans have high expectations too as i do and the coaching staff does
5739710 i think the blame for this game game has to be spread around the room not just on one player
5739711 its about how we perform i appreciate the compliment and im glad were close if we take care of business we can take care of well finish where we would like to
5739712 there was nothing to point at him as far as not doing things right
5739713 it was either things werent there or a guy wasnt making plays for him i thought he played extremely well when you look at his composure his energy his excitement
5739714 we play the best players they guy that gives this team the best opportunity at victory thats who we play all the rest of them just dont stay in the doghouse
5739715 i worked hard to make sure that doesnt need to be discussed any more

5739719 i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract
5739720 i have three years left on my contract and im putting two or three years more so im very happy being part of this family
5739721 he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team you want your own fans to be behind him
5739722 whats your advice to would be bloggers to attract an audience

5739724 es mejor ser amado que temido o al rev s la respuesta es que ser a deseable ser ambas cosas pero como es dif cil que las dos se den al mismo tiempo es mucho m s seguro para un pr ncipe ser temido que ser amado en caso de tener que renunciar a una de las dos
5739725 one explanation might be that theres a group of consumers thats holding off making do with the devices that they have either because of larger economic concerns or because they dont see any value yet in the new voice and data services that are driving some of these new handsets
5739726 sen mccain is not going to solve our energy crisis because frankly he helped create it he blamed our dependence on foreign oil on the inaction of politicians in washington but hes been there for the last 26 years and he did very little as a congressman and as a senator to help resolve this oil challenge he was there when we saw the ups and downs of world crude oil over many many years
5739727 the economy is by far the number one issue it is a very deep concern that people have there is economic pessimism out there people worry about their own situation they worry about their childrens situation
5739728 women and people of color are particularly pessimistic about the economy but no one is optimistic about the economy
5739729 voters think that the economy is in recession and that frame of being in a recession and having washington do nothing about their problems is one of the most powerful ways to articulate a desire for change
5739730 while barack obama would not raise taxes for middle class families
5739731 sen mccain cannot make a similar promise for his tax plan because for the first time in history he would make families pay taxes on the health insurance they get from their employers that would be a 3 6 trillion tax increase on middle class families
5739732 i see senator obama as a president that can move beyond partisan politics to build a national movement for change on foreign policy energy independence the environment and all the other interconnected issues that will shape the 21st century strategic environment
5739733 i think the threats that are facing us are diverse theyre complex and a cold war mentality is not the place to look for the answers
5739734 in the senate when we needed him he fought for more funding for ptsd more funding for traumatic brain injuries he was an early supporter of the new gi bill
5739735 i believe in senator obamas integrity i think he has the character it takes to lead the armed forces as the next commander in chief

5739833 he does possess one thing which enlightened people seldom or never possess and that is a sense of responsibility i t did have the advantage of giving kipling a certain grip on reality
5739834 the ruling power is always faced with the question in such and such circumstances what would you do whereas the opposition is not obliged to take responsibility or make any real decisions where it is a permanent and pensioned opposition the quality of its thought deteriorates accordingly

5739838 besides me being really vigilant about it the mri is the number one reason that im going to live if this had been caught a year from now or when i was 40 i probably wouldnt be able to live through this or i would have to undergo such much more than i have
5739839 its incredibly expensive so for me one of the things when this all happened was that im putting together a program to pay for mris for women who are at high risk which means women who have had it in their family or know that theyre gene positive
5739840 were also going to pay for the genetic testing because thats very very expensive its upwards of 2 000 to 3 000 so all of that is coming together right now

5739891 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5739892 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal

5739895 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5739896 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5739897 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5739898 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5739899 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5739900 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5739901 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5739902 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5739903 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5739904 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5739905 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5739906 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5739907 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5739908 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5739909 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5739910 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5739911 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5739912 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5739913 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5739914 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5739915 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5739916 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5739917 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5739918 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5739919 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5739920 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5739921 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5739922 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5739923 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5739924 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5739925 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5739926 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5739927 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5739928 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5739929 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5739930 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5739931 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

5739952 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5739953 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5739954 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5739955 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5739956 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5739957 this is a planning took where all things are going
5739958 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5739959 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5739960 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5739961 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5739962 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5739963 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5739964 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5739965 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5739966 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5739967 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5739968 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5739969 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5739970 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5739971 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5739972 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5739973 egs enhanced geothermal systems could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
5739974 could conceivably be deployed almost anywhere and is essentially limitless in supply
5739975 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5739976 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5739977 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5739978 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5739979 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5739980 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5739981 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5739982 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5739983 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5739984 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5739985 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5739986 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5739987 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5739988 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5739989 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5739990 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5739991 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5739992 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5739993 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5739994 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5739995 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5739996 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5739997 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5739998 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5739999 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
