1990000 it not only goes to where the jobs are it goes to the people that need to get to the jobs
1990001 what we always wanted to discuss about writer usability improvements
1990002 one of the biggest struggles that most companies have not surprisingly is predicting the future
1990003 doing that today is a very politically charged system simple things like project updates are full of politics full of meetings one of the biggest values of prediction markets is you get a lot more people looking at these major questions and hopefully get through a lot of that political pressure to really get truthful answers
1990004 that sort of behavior sends a real sign to employees that this is something that is important
1990005 this is the guy i want to be the federal attorney of nevada
1990006 uh they were fired because they were a bad attorney
1990007 nope it was because the hiring person goodling thought they were a lesbian
1990008 well its just politics whats the big deal if a governor was convicted on trumped up charges if less qualified people were hired if corruption investigations were squashed by firing the people who were suppose to be in charge of them i mean nixon did that too and he said it was legal so it must be
1990009 federal investigators have obtained documents showing that kyle sampson then chief of staff to attorney general alberto gonzales and chris oprison then an associate white house counsel drafted and approved the letter even though they had first hand knowledge that the assertions were not true the justice department later had to repudiate the sampson oprison letter and sent a new one informing congress that it could no longer stand by the earlier assertions
1990010 read the constitution the president can fire any attorney he wants for any reason it is an executive appointment they all do this bush fired nine clinton fired them all except one
1990011 the number of refugees is growing a humanitarian crisis is looming
1990012 the number of refugees is growing a humanitarian crisis is looming
1990013 im glad that i can be a witness if they need me in court
1990014 a reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property
1990015 i think the reckless part had to do with after she struck the first van then accelerated and took off at a high rate of speed
1990016 el atl tico jugar a partir de 2010 en la peineta
1990017 a todos nos han impresionado mucho las infraestructuras deportivas pek n ha hecho una apuesta no solamente funcional sino est tica pues ha hecho de las sedes elementos de identificaci n de una nueva ciudad y un nuevo pa s yo me qued impresionado y pensamos que no nos ten amos que conformar con elementos funcionales sino que adem s deb amos introducir los valores que la arquitectura espa ola est ofreciendo a todo el mundo
1990018 que es fant stica para el atl tico de madrid y la candidatura
1990019 no creo que tardemos mucho m s que un par de semanas a la vuelta del verano para cerrar definitivamente la operaci n eso significa que se licitar n las obras correspondientes para la conclusi n del estadio ol mpico y su adaptaci n para los partidos de f tbol ser lo que tarde el atl tico de madrid en mudarse del calder n al nuevo estadio y en la temporada 2010 2011 jugar en la peineta

1990021 we are shocked by this terrible tragedy and our hearts go out to ingrid riveras family and friends we are grateful to the new york police department for arresting a suspect in this crime
1990022 we continue to cooperate with police and answer any questions they may have
1990023 i like to try to say things nobody else is saying and to explore areas that are insufficiently commented on in the media
1990024 i am a philosophical and political conservative a christian and a family man my conservatism is traditionalist not libertarian and therefore idiosyncratic
1990025 obviously right now were tied up with apb and everything else but hopefully in the future well have the resource and something can be worked out with microsoft we would have loved to have seen it we poured five years of our lives into that game you know weve got guys on the development team that have crackdown tattoos permanent tattoos on their arms were extremely passionate about it
1990026 we feel theres a serious intention by the american forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least
1990027 it should not be considered an end to the mehdi army but its a halfway step to dissolving the mehdi army if the u s began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution
1990028 it is a good step to repair our mistakes especially sectarianism and sectarian killings we are very sorry about these sectarian killings because some parties supported this violence for their own advantage
1990029 to renounce violence and participate peacefully in the iraqi political process
1990030 as of last night the schedule was one of the issues being discussed between the two sides there is no agreement yet but this is what the iraqis are asking for
1990031 if we find this does not happen and the u s forces change their stance over the timetable we can change direction also
1990032 this will not mean ending the ceasefire it will depend on whats going on the ground
1990033 i have a horrid confession to make i like microsoft word
1990034 how much is the savings from that cut rate computer worth if you cant get your work done
1990035 macs are more common in offices than many people in the media realise
1990036 in europe scee is also beginning their expanded closed beta directly targeting consumers who have been most active on playstation network and playstation store
1990037 regarding brian he recently resigned to form a startup technology company outside the game industry which is why weve posted about the open position this change wont impact the game
1990038 were really pleased with the look and feel that brian helped create for diablo iii and the new person we bring on board will work with the other artists on the team to maintain the art style moving forward
1990039 i have only a few memories he left when i was 5 or 6
1990040 he told us it was not possible for americans to use his name
1990041 the investigation remains very active and grows more focused by the day
1990042 i dont know if im awake or even breathing right now

1990051 he is considering the options that are available he will respond to the governments allegations and defend himself
1990052 we will prepare a case the president should be there in parliament and defend himself and at least say i am not a crook
1990053 we are going to oppose it it is a half baked effort and a sure recipe for disaster
1990054 can dismiss the government suspend it or leave the stage but that option is very remote he would do that only when he realises that the real powers are not supporting him
1990055 exercise vigilance in entering into new commitments for public provided financial support for trade with iran
1990056 a labor intensive audience that can fall between the cracks because of personnel
1990057 the transfer process is more complex than the financial aid system
1990058 theyre not giving any more money but theyre passing a policy
1990059 its a broad framework without drilling down to the details
1990060 since athens i worked hard for this moment and here i am i know how much effort i put in and im ready for any outcome the fact that i could not have worked harder gives me satisfaction
1990061 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1990062 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1990063 we resolutely oppose any words or actions which interfere in the internal affairs of another country in the name of issues such as human rights and religion
1990064 we are making clear to china that being a global economic leader carries with it the duty to act responsibly on matters from energy to the environment to development in places like africa
1990065 the american people care deeply about the people of burma and dream for the day the people will be free
1990066 its only than shwe and a few other generals who want to isolate burma so i told him engagement was very important
1990067 there is a big turnover and it is more difficult for us to provide individual and personal help
1990068 is legitimate defense since they migrants are locked up and innocent
1990069 im in france since 2001 and if i return what will i do in tunisia
1990070 even if they put me in handcuffs i wont go back
1990071 public views on u s health system organization a call for new directions
1990072 the majority of physicians still practice in small practices with just a few doctors
1990073 once they experience it for the first time they come back
1990074 i want to get a picture of it because its amazing
1990075 its crazy were always together as a team and just to see their reaction its amazing just peoples reaction to kobe alone is crazy i have to walk the other way
1990076 i saw a guy i think kobe gave him an autograph he took off running and laughing and jumping and stuff i thought that must have been pretty special to him he went off to tell his friends about it
1990077 it will probably be the most watched game in sports history
1990078 probably one of the williams sisters ive never met them before couple of track stars u s 400 metre runner jeremy wariner ive never met him before and hes a texas guy and everything
1990079 i remember watching the games i dont know who they were playing but i remember it was not even close
1990080 that was the greatest team ever assembled everybody knows that
1990081 i think we all know whats riding on this and we all want to win
1990082 first and foremost we want to win whether we won the last however many international tournaments we want to win period
1990083 ever since 2002 theyve been emerging theyve been playing together and theyve been talking about the same things i know this because i talk to jose and he says theyre playing their best basketball right now
1990084 i think theyre the best team besides us of course
1990085 this only happens once every four years and ill never see it happen again in beijing this is a once in a lifetime opportunity so i dont want to be cramped up in my room
1990086 i know that we have a goal in mind and i will make sure i keep that in mind when im out there having fun but ill get my rest and drink lots of water
1990087 it still has a lot of work to be done so hopefully by tonight or tomorrow itll be done
1990088 theres only so much i can do because of copyright hopefully it will be going up soon
1990089 when you think youve gone through something and youre having troubles in your life and everything theres always somebody in a much worse position
1990090 this isnt about winning of course wed all love to win and everything but this is about representing your country having pride in just being here and competing against the world
1990091 the classic is that theres always some new cure for cancer that comes out
1990092 and unfortunately people become disappointed when it doesnt come to fruition but part of that is because it was preliminary findings and then when there are more mature findings or when its analyzed a different way with a larger sample size it really didnt come out to those same findings
1990093 i was surprised that of the scientific communications that companies give out that about 60 per cent of them are based on findings from abstracts
1990094 so the majority of the findings of the press releases are related to preliminary findings that arent fully peer reviewed
1990095 about a fifth of those they didnt really say where they got their data they just said findings of a study it was a real sherlock holmes type of enterprise to try and track down where this study came from or was this original data was this abstract data or was it presented at a meeting
1990096 but really they didnt talk about the study limitations and the idea that this is preliminary studies or preliminary data almost universally this was not discussed
1990097 they often talk about adverse events or harms in this study similar to what they would do with commercials on tv where they list a variety of adverse events or side effects or harms
1990098 however we can clearly state that as the community that develops medicines and vaccines that improve and save lives our members are committed to accuracy and transparency in all public communications
1990099 recognizing the space limitations of a press release and the complexity of the research and development of new medicines and vaccines other sources are readily available and accessible to journalists seeking further information including websites and contacts
1990100 pose a challenge to the state as the main provider of security and guarantor of human rights
1990101 provide the basis for long term sustainable development in regions where insecurity is currently the biggest hurdle for widespread education investment and economic growth
1990102 it is incumbent upon states and the international community to seek clearly defined frameworks that allow the legitimate industry to continue its positive work
1990103 it was mostly ad libbed with russell asking her for advice about hosting the show
1990104 theres also a 9 000 pound elephant in it as in the elephant in the room
1990105 making a kids tv show using some of the tech weve developed for games in the mid distance personally to be able to dabble around in cg and film would be interesting and warner allows me to push in those directions without quitting the day job so to speak
1990106 we are best at discriminating the facial features that are typical of our neighbors and if they happen to be parrots we become very good at recognizing individual birds
1990107 ultimately we are interested in what happens in a natural environment
1990108 but some questions require more control over the properties of visual stimuli than a picture of a natural scene would allow
1990109 the response of individual neurons can be strongly influenced by simple stimuli in the surround of the receptive field a phenomenon known as contextual modulation
1990110 context is an important part of how we perceive visual stimuli
1990111 and these results show how individual neurons might adjust their properties in different natural environments such as on a beach or in a forest
1990112 new media in old bottles barrons contextual first amendment and copyright in the digital age
1990113 hes drinking it ha ha tomorrow we will give him transmission fluid
1990114 someone who feels they have a closer affinity to animals than their own kind
1990115 check city has utilized cutting edge technology coupled with a progressive attitude towards customer care to service short term borrowers across the united states
1990116 we will continue to bring that same level of service to hawaii while striving to make the online borrowing experience better for our customers
1990117 your company has been best company ive dealt with thank you
1990118 thank you your company always has the best customer service
1990119 there was no way of even finding all the current checklist projects without days of googling
1990120 as a result much of the great work thats going into developing community standards was being overlooked and different communities were at risk of developing mutually incompatible standards mibbi will help to prevent them from reinventing the wheel
1990121 communities working together through mibbi will produce non overlapping minimal information modules
1990122 the idea is that each checklist will fit neatly into a jigsaw with each community being able to take the pieces that are relevant to them
1990123 mibbi represents the first new effort taking the open biomedical ontologies obo as its role model
1990124 the mibbi portal operates in a manner analogous to obo as an open information resource while the mibbi foundry fosters collaborative development and integration of checklists into self contained modules just like the obo foundry does for the ontologies
1990125 a series of big mistakes and corrections and slipped ship dates but all of these helped make it a good game
1990126 ok well why arent gamers really interested in this product
1990127 hey remember how much you loved this kind of game guess what were trying to do a game just like it
1990128 el se or zapatero se est quedando sin dinero para financiar nada
1990129 el se or zapatero se est quedando sin dinero para financiar nada
1990130 its hillarious how terrified all you right wingnuts are of an intelligent black man
1990131 we had to take some tough decisions we got through it
1990132 content providers must take into account specific viewing times repeat trips and the need to inform educate and influence
1990133 especially as a means of security and safety for students and staff digital signage also has great possibilities for giving directions scheduling class information and more
1990134 theres not one student out there who wouldnt love to see rotating images from last nights game read news articles about his or her universitys achievements or see ticketing schedules
1990135 i think many of us who have spent time in china tended to discount predictions made with whether or not china could handle these games successfully the international media already has a pretty big presence and even with an increase in quantity there wouldnt be a lack of sophistication with understanding not like theyre letting in press for the first time as they were with nixons visit to china
1990136 i think in the last few months there have been more hiccups than expected in the sense that no one anticipated ethnic unrest in tibet no one anticipated disruptions with torch protests and even those of us who wrote about pollution anticipated they wouldnt have as much as difficulty as they have had so i think predictions are difficult to make and we dont know how the games will go off
1990137 for the first time in a while the summer olympics is taking place where the host city is a big part if not the dominant part of the story and well go back to l
1990138 it spent 40 to 50 billion to rebuild the capital city of beijing and then theres a breakout of ethnic unrest in tibet and the torch relay was interrupted there are very significant political and diplomatic elements out there that theres no question that the olympics coverage cannot be defined solely as a sporting event
1990139 theres a big devotion of resources on chinas part to accommodate international media and make clear internally to their own people that there are more reporters at these games and that underscores the importance of the events
1990140 we have been so used to hard drives for so many years windows is optimized for that obviously
1990141 my guess is that samsung and microsoft are maybe working on the os recognizing an ssd with a 4kb sector size instead of a hard disk drive with a 512 byte sector size
1990142 the cost per gigabyte of a 2 5 in ssd is something like five times that of a hard disk drive
1990143 he is considering the options that are available he will respond to the governments allegations and defend himself
1990144 we will prepare a case the president should be there in parliament and defend himself and at least say i am not a crook
1990145 we are going to oppose it it is a half baked effort and a sure recipe for disaster
1990146 he can dismiss the government suspend it or leave the stage but that option is very remote he would do that only when he realizes that the real powers are not supporting him
1990147 do you think tommy lee will always be a character in your life

1990151 unfortunately with current proprietary tracking systems users sacrifice location privacy
1990152 indeed even while the device is still in the rightful owners possession the tracking system is keeping tabs on the locations it and its owner visits even worse with some commercial products even outsiders parties not affiliated with the tracking provider can piggy back on the tracking systems internet traffic to uncover a users private information and locations visited
1990153 despite all this here we are in another election still talking about our oil addiction still more dependent than ever why
1990154 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1990155 el gesto del barcelona es digno de tener en cuenta un m rito deportivo es un gesto de muy buena fe hacia todos los aficionados al f tbol no s lo a los argentinos
1990156 its amazing that an entire year has gone by and no one has been held accountable
1990157 they said it was a smaller type of vehicle they claimed it was dark in color but it happened around dusk
1990158 and sometimes at night vehicles look darker than they really are
1990159 there had to have been extensive front end damage and windshield damage
1990160 what were looking for is any information about a vehicle being stashed away somewhere and not being used since last august if anyone knows of a vehicle like that wed be real interested in finding out why
1990161 canoeing kayaking hiking biking he just loved being outside he rode at dusk but he always rode with a reflective vest and light
1990162 no news is not good news for me as far as resolution and closure
1990163 i hope this money and new exposure will draw attention to this again someone out there knows something
1990164 young people are creating youth communities and gangs in search of the influences that could once have been found in traditional communities
1990165 all the threads that hold a community together were given as a motivation to join gangs
1990166 an all electric range of 10 to 15 miles and improved average mileage of up to 100 miles per gallon
1990167 its really sad to see such a decision was handed down putting in danger the entire soccer tournament
1990168 we could do beach soccer or a five a side tournament that would be very sad and the world would not understand it
1990169 i plea along with blatter to leave the players in china and let them live their dream
1990170 soccer is very important we are keen to have the best possible players at the tournament
1990171 we are pleased that cas has confirmed our legal interpretation
1990172 it is laid down quite clearly in the fifa statutes
1990173 our position would have been different if the legal position had been clarified earlier
1990174 i believe the matter was deliberately delayed until just before the olympics to put the clubs in an awkward position
1990175 reinforcing the global nuclear order for peace and prosperity the role of the iaea to 2020 and beyond
1990176 there is a disconnect between what you are asking the agency to do and what you are ready to finance
1990177 and you talked to that faggot motherfucker while you put me on hold oh no you did not just do that motherfucker
1990178 you can wear these tevas because youre straight so you wont look like a lesbian
1990179 ive only been in romantic psychical relationships with men but i do find women attractive however that isnt something i am going to explore right now because i am in a monogamous relationship with a man and that monogamy is very important to me
1990180 well gee you know what youre right thank you before we had this talk i had no clue
1990181 well how do you know you dont like men maybe you just havent met the right guy
1990182 well how do you know youre bi when blah blah
1990183 im attracted to both men and women you know the definition of bisexual
1990184 the quickest way to do this on the iphone is to write the details down on a piece of paper and re enter them
1990185 maybe apple should offer business users a free pen and notepad with each sale
1990186 after ten years of labour british business is groaning under the weight of an excessive state whose first instinct is to reach for the rulebook and regulate
1990187 if we find two gangsters fighting each other and one of them kills another this does not make the first gangster less of a criminal
1990188 bombshell allegations against the bush white house a new book claiming among other things that it ordered yes ordered the cia to forge a letter drawing connections between iraq and al qaeda to justify the 2003 invasion
1990189 the alleged crimes of president bush and vice president cheney are worse than watergate
1990190 if ultimately in congressional hearings and whatnot if theyre able to show that the white house directed the cia as i show in the book with lots of testimony that the cia was directed by the white house to do this disinformation campaign on this letter there will be issues of legality that will be debated in terms of high crimes
1990191 heres what george tenet says because this is a very specific charge that you make someone at the white house told him to get a letter forged making this alleged connection between al qaeda and saddam hussein tenet said there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort who ordered him to do so
1990192 why would anyone at the white house be dumb enough to write down on a piece of paper for george tenet to go ahead and commit an illegal act
1990193 at this point in the history of this white house frankly wolf im not sure how you can even ask that question
1990194 i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter
1990195 blitzer based on everything you know should the president be impeached
1990196 we respect and support the bands decision and have complied with their request to be removed from this years shortlist
1990197 the force was so abrupt that i felt that i was going to vomit
1990198 i seldom travel abroad now because ive found that taiwans scenery is not inferior to that in other countries but the service attitude in taiwan sometimes makes travelers uncomfortable
1990199 the official slogan of taiwanese tourism is taiwan touch your heart and what touches travelers hearts are those who have direct contact with them
1990200 i need to go and tell the king that the sky is falling
1990201 if comcast can no longer outright block its users peer to peer uploads then all isps are going to switch to usage based pricing models
1990202 despite a softening global economy we delivered solid gains in worldwide sales
1990203 its been a huge honor to get back with my good friends
1990204 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other that doesnt mean it hadnt crossed my mind or andys or stewarts
1990205 we are pleased to see external experts recognising the strength of our surveillance systems on healthcare associated infection and suggesting that other boards might like to put similar arrangements in place
1990206 we already comply with the recommendations made and will work with the scottish government on any new developments for instance we already have computerised tracking systems to detect cases and we already review severe cases to see where lessons can be learned
1990207 drill here drill now drill here drill now four legs good two legs bad
1990208 want americans to move to the urban core live in tenements take light rail to their government jobs
1990209 mr bush is the triumph of the seemingly average american man
1990210 hes not an intellectual intellectuals start all the trouble in the world
1990211 if theres a fire on the block hell run out and help
1990212 if you asked me out of all the people in the bar i could believe he did it over the others
1990213 he just always seemed disgruntled or distraught something really bad was going on he just wasnt happy
1990214 theres no single device for everything especially when you consider the input and display on a smart phone or handset
1990215 joining the council provides clements the opportunity to represent the international insurance segment and be at the forefront of issues concerning the global marketplace
1990216 the opportunities and challenges in education have never been greater and we are looking forward to peters leadership as we navigate our transformation from textbook publishing to providing innovative and comprehensive educational services and solutions to schools around the world
1990217 most importantly peter shares our values and our passion for making a difference in education
1990218 those skilled in war subdue the enemys army without battle they conquer by strategy
1990219 to be so well prepared that direct warfare becomes unnecessary
1990220 its war by other means and the chinese have been very bright
1990221 i have no doubt that china will get more gold medals than us but they wont do it by going head to head with the us they understand that they cant compete directly
1990222 chinas way of training athletes has its advantages ninety five per cent of national champions emerge through this system
1990223 no athlete would say i get too many gold medals im tired of winning medals
1990224 if you are an athlete you must always want to win the gold medal to prove your strength
1990225 at athens it was a big surprise that china got more medals than russia we cannot surpass america in gold medals this time because we do not have the same economic power
1990226 there are academics who argue for reform the reason it hasnt happened yet is the olympics if china does well reform is likely to be delayed
1990227 as god is my witness im hell bent on making it work
1990228 we underlined through this offer that we were striving for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute
1990229 the taste of her cherry chap stick i kissed a girl just to try it i hope my boyfriend dont mind it it felt so wrong it felt so right
1990230 i hope you hang yourself with your h amp m scarf while jacking off listening to mozart you bitch and moan about la wishing you were in the rain reading hemingway
1990231 totally unintentionally steam up the glasses of daily mail readers
1990232 all i need is for my man to live up to his role
1990233 in truth the debate around ur so gay and i kissed a girl which offer intriguing perspectives on masculinity and femininity respectively should be less about sexuality and more focussed on gender politics
1990234 i hope you hang yourself with your h amp m scarf while jacking off listening to mozart you bitch
1990235 weve tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the bidders have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements
1990236 we are reviewing the draft request for proposal with an eye toward ensuring that it addresses the issues raised by the gao in a way that facilitates a fair and non political evaluation of the competing bids
1990237 this is an excellent opportunity to learn and practice these new behaviors in a virtual environment and in real life
1990238 its also a great place to meet other avatars and share information and experiences
1990239 we hope to develop multi national collaborations in sl to increase awareness knowledge skills and support for healthy living

1990251 the most talented group of fighters to have ever represented britain at one olympic games
1990252 the money we have received in the last couple of years goes to the elite athletes in the form of an untaxed sum of between 18 000 and 25 000 to each of them
1990253 they then have their accommodation taken care of travel coaching conditioning nutrition strength training technical analysis
1990254 richard caborn realised that many sports at which we traditionally excel in the olympics tend to be for those from what you might describe as privileged backgrounds whereas boxing is something that reaches kids in the inner cities and kids from all ethnicities and all backgrounds
1990255 things are looking good for beijing hopefully we will have medals to celebrate at the end of the games but the situation looks even brighter for london in 2012 there are so many talented youngsters coming through that great britain could rank among the world powers of the sport i believe by london 2012 we will be in the top four in the world
1990256 really there are very few sports that reach into the inner cities
1990257 all over the country clubs are saying they are getting more young boxers than ever coming through their doors and recently it was announced that boxing is being introduced into schools as a gcse subject youngsters are realising there is an alternative to the gangs to knives and drugs and boxing is having a really positive impact in helping us address problems in our cities
1990258 i am excited about being given this responsibility and about our prospects of success
1990259 i have been around a few years now so i have been able to see the transformation in the sport that has been shown in the results we have all achieved at various tournaments around the world
1990260 it must have been tough for amir four years ago when he had to do it all on his own
1990261 this is the olympics the greatest tournament of all and i will be doing everything i can to make sure everybody here performs at their best as for me it didnt work out in chicago now im here to win
1990262 i am not sure why kelsey was even named in this suit
1990263 he was an actor who signed on to the project after the script was written
1990264 essentially except for the character names and the relationship developed between the main characters played by defendant kevin costner and his daughter the entire concept of swing vote was taken from the copyrighted work
1990265 for the first time weve built a sequence from ancient dna that is essentially without error
1990266 we also wanted to know about the history of the neandertals themselves
1990267 most argue there were a few thousand neandertals that roamed over europe 40 000 years ago
1990268 its still an open question for the future whether this small group of neandertals was a general feature or was this caused by some bottleneck in their population size that happened late in the game
1990269 domainpeople is excited to be one of the first registrars to offer pro under icanns newly expanded registration criteria

1990283 it wasnt long ago that pickens was predicting 180 barrels of oil when i heard that my immediate thought was that he was shorting the market this guy is only in it for himself
1990284 why does anyone in the united states have a problem with this
1990285 wtf are you smoking tbp those things arent related at all
1990286 they are related if all our cars which run on oil somehow run on magical natural gas if thats true then my windfarms can reduce natural gas plant usage and then well have more natural gas for our cars damn i am so smart and rich
1990287 virtually all of the us natural gas consumption never goes anywhere near an electrical power plant
1990288 hmmm give a rich texas redneck my energy dollar or the saudi royal family to fund al qaeda why does anyone in the united states have a problem with this

1990293 the vulnerability is that your dns gets poisoned you can tell if your dns is poisoned by looking at your cache in a dns server but what you cant tell is if any user queried your data got back bad data and then acted on it dns doesnt log queries so you have no record of it
1990294 so we may never know if anyone got dns poisoning for say and went to a phony bank of america and gave up their account information
1990295 theres a disconnect between detecting the problem and detecting the people affected by the problem
1990296 there are a lot of chinese sites that are actively trying to exploit the flaw to the point that some major network operators are blocking all traffic from china
1990297 some customers are finding this out as they try to get some of their olympic coverage from china
1990298 some dns servers are falling over just from the attack traffic
1990299 the attack still works it just takes much longer to execute as a result its absolutely critical that organizations monitor dns and deploy other protective measures to detect and stop the attack
1990300 dans fix slowed it enough that we can detect and respond to it but only if we use additional security controls like ids ips intrusion detection system intrusion prevention system on top of the patch
1990301 when we initially launched lawlink we were inundated with requests from attorneys all over the world
1990302 but because lawlink manually screens every applicant we only had the resources to handle attorneys from the us now that weve grown so have our resources we are happy to welcome attorneys from canada australia and the united kingdom
1990303 even with dns fixed there are other scenarios in which unencrypted ip traffic is lost to an attacker
1990304 this represents a continuation of the correction in commercial market prices that began last fall
1990305 the jobs created have had a positive impact engendering a feeling of security in the communities and have promoted cohesion as people from different groups participated jointly
1990306 the first aspect of my speech is what most of us are here gathered for is this country fair to the niger delta people
1990307 there is another law that is called the exclusive economic zone act
1990308 let me take you to the most important aspect to me
1990309 the first thing to say is that in baghdad you know what the war is about dont you it is a religious war between the shiites and the sunnis in rivers state in bayelsa and other parts of the niger delta who is fighting whom what is the war about
1990310 the way to define criminality is that anybody who breaks the laws of the federal republic of nigeria is a criminal the law says we shall not bear arms and so anybody who bears arms has committed a crime and so they are all criminals
1990311 the struggle for now because it does not exist because a struggle is ideological and there is no ideological bent to the struggle we are seeing
1990312 the first principle is self survival if nigeria has rejected me should i reject myself
1990313 we ask ourselves one basic question what are we voted here to do what is our responsibility
1990314 but the truth is that when it militancy started nobody thought it will get to this point
1990315 we must demand from our leaders accountability they must account not for the funds alone they must account for what they have turned our children into they must tell us why the next mans life is not as important as their own life they must when they started it it was just simple local government area matter chairman of council that they were struggling for and to publicly say that we have won an election today those local governments are not even in their hands anymore today they cannot go home today governors are demanding for more security in their convoys today legislators are demanding for more security from their governors today commissioners are demanding for security
1990316 that is where i differ i say my mind anywhere i go to worse can happen and i will tell you the truth these boys require force you know why they require force they are not ideological if the process today is ideological count me in
1990317 but i cannot back a criminal entity where people sit down and kidnap and do oil bunkering to the detriment of our economy and you say we will negotiate i am not part of the negotiation
1990318 when i was a speaker before i became governor i used to see some of them they tell me these are the people who are into this shooting and when they come they carry young girls they wear these jeans with half of their buttocks showing and they come with jeeps and imagine if n250 000 can buy them jeeps
1990319 then we the governors at that point we have a responsibility the responsibility we have is social rehabilitation
1990320 as a governor i have plans of what i want to do but as i am talking to you i cannot execute those things because i have security threats i have over a n100 billion resting in the bank resting

1990327 shows a lack of understanding of the insights of joseph schumpeter
1990328 fear is now one of the most pervasive factors in perpetuating political regimes
1990329 arab regimes impose a whole range of restrictions on political expression thinking it their duty to control all aspects of political life but it is as deep rooted in the family school and workplace
1990330 this is the ultimate triumph of authoritarianism the internalisation of fear when one carries a private security antenna a voice inside warns people to stay out of politics and spare themselves the pain
1990331 you can either be on the 1199 bandwagon or under the 1199 bandwagon
1990332 there really are only a couple of ways you can go here
1990333 you can either be on the 1199 bandwagon or under the 1199 bandwagon
1990334 we are big we are loud and we will get a contract with your company so settle now
1990335 the current political advantage of the republican party stems from the ability of its candidates to develop signature ideas this strategy is rewarded even when the electorate has ideological reservations
1990336 a rational electorate is reluctant to support someone who does not exhibit commitment to some ideology
1990337 voters rightly perceive that someone without ideological commitment cannot have developed a valuable political program
1990338 to attract a majority of votes parties cannot simply try to appear median quite the contrary
1990339 winning an election is generally about crafting a convincing philosophy that the electorate will view as superior to that of the opponents
1990340 current policies to tackle hiv aids in africa emphasise individual behaviour such as the abc approach to prevention abstain be faithful condomise however these measures require that people have hope for the future and goals to aim for and if wider economic and social circumstances are so poor that people lack hope for the future then these current policies will have limited success
1990341 hope is quite straightforward to measure via questionnaires and surveys can help to identify high risk environments
1990342 although there is not a great deal of experience in developing programmes to increase hope policies such as cash support for children microfinance for small businesses womens education reduced discriminations against sexual minorities and health system reform will improve the wider environment and with more to live for interventions to encourage individuals to change their behaviour are more likely to succeed
1990343 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
1990344 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
1990345 a significant departure from the way our city has operated in the past
1990346 others should be recognized as structures which may be razed without delay
1990347 to what extent are we encouraging decline and economic decay
1990348 i love the clothes everyone is good looking the plot line is a riot i love the show they called and said you are very
1990349 probably to the consternation of certain people on the upper east side they really get it its a pretty clear picture of how a lot of these kids really are

1990354 reclaim the school system for parents and families who live in the district
1990355 in the long run it does make more people feel cynical about the process and that can cause them to feel detachment from the school board
1990356 in that case whenever the school board does anything there isnt a lot of trust from the public
1990357 if you look at the turnout in these low profile elections it doesnt take all that much to take over a school board
1990358 there are some people who dont like it philosophically but i think this is a trend that will continue to increase as partisan groups take a closer look at non partisan races because of the importance of the issues and as a training ground for those candidates to eventually run for partisan offices
1990359 overall these local elections have become more contentious as city councils and school boards are taking on more complicated issues like
1990360 they already earn in the range of 20 to 25 percent more than other pilots in regional air traffic
1990361 even at the insurgencys peak we never faced such a grim situation these religious riots are the worst i remember
1990362 theyve driven a wedge between hindus and muslims who were living as brothers
1990363 there was no need to transfer the land the arrangements had worked well for years
1990364 this is the most polarised situation ive seen in a generation
1990365 from the 30th of june we have no longer been able to ship a pc with a xp licence
1990366 however what we have been able to do with microsoft is ship pcs with a vista business licence but with xp pre loaded that is still the majority of business computers we are selling today
1990367 looking into a crystal ball i dont think businesses will see much value in upgrading to vista until late next year and even so microsoft will probably have come out with something else by then
1990368 given that theres a mountain of evidence to refute this report including multiple reports from forrester and other top tier analysts this appears to be more focused on making sensationalist statements rather than offering a thoughtful industry perspective based on conversations with it operations professionals or deep knowledge of enterprise deployment cycles

1990373 we are extremely pleased to have attained gold certified partner status in the partner program
1990374 the benefits provided through our gold certified partner status will allow us to continue to enhance the offerings we provide our clients
1990375 customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the gap between their business demands and technology capabilities
1990376 they need to trust in a company that can act as an expert adviser for their long term strategic technology plans microsoft gold certified partners which have certified expertise and direct training and support from microsoft can build a positive customer experience with our technologies today microsoft recognizes prosource development as a new gold certified partner for demonstrating its expertise in providing customer satisfaction using microsoft products and technology
1990377 while seeking gold certified partner status prosource development has been training our development staff following the general release of microsoft dynamics ax 2009
1990378 we anticipate that there will be a rise in demand for upgrades to the latest version of dynamics ax and we are positioned to be on the forefront of service providers with our extensive experience and lower cost model
1990379 one of the most significant welfare issues affecting any equine breed or discipline
1990380 should be abolished since the acknowledged conflicts of interest which involve many of them cannot be reasonably resolved
1990381 there are very few disciplines of animal performance that dont include abuses the walking horse folks are not unique but their egregious practices are really unacceptable
1990382 i do buzz off doing stuff on my own i have gained confidence with that ive beaten a lot of cynics down im in a very comfortable good place in my mind about that
1990383 i will continue my solo stuff but it seemed a shame to leave the band dormant when there is so much talent there

1990390 he wanted to die at home and he died at home in general i should say that aleksandr isayevich lived a difficult but happy life
1990391 initial reaction is that these are better than expected with a lower loss and higher core tier 1 capital
1990392 unlike air france klm and lufthansa swiss there are few network overlaps and the networks are complementary ba offers iberia a strong global network to north america middle east and asia a large and loyal customer base and an entrenched position at london heathrow iberia offers ba the largest latin american network growth opportunities a strong balance sheet competitive cost base a strong management team and 120m of slots at heathrow
1990393 we estimate that combined revenue could be boosted 1 per cent and non fuel costs reduced by 3 5 per cent by 2015 we estimate total joint synergies of the order of 200 350m by 2012 and 500 700m by 2015 a potential joint venture with american airlines could boost revenue further from 2010 most cost synergies are likely to come from combining maintenance and back office activities
1990394 the environment for northern foods has toughened again recently as the consumer continues to weaken and cost inflation recovery becomes harder we have updated our numbers and now forecast reduced volumes in the chilled business 2 1 per cent a margin squeeze from continued cost inflation and the pension surplus of 66m eroding completely in 2009 resulting in a reduced level of profitability which we see as sustainable
1990395 we appreciate that the market will need to adjust to this lower level of profitability however even on this level of returns we believe the shares offer value to investors with a longer term perspective
1990396 this was basically a meeting between two families who have a long relationship it was really about reminiscences
1990397 i think everybody is aware that there has been a bit of testiness in the canada china relationship in the last couple of years
1990398 were now at a stage where both china and canada are very happy to be engaging in ways that will enable us to continue to express our differences of view but to ensure the relationship continues to deepen and get stronger across the board
1990399 the authorities said they would turn those words into deeds regrettably the deeds mock those words
1990400 there are stringent security measures in place on all levels but particularly in the key landmark areas of the city and surrounding the games
1990401 theres something like 300 000 security surveillance cameras in the city observing your every move wherever youre going you get scanned if youre going into the subway or certainly into or out of the olympic venues
1990402 beijing is measuring the air quality index saying it is 88 keep in mind the safety limit set by the world health organization is 50 the canadian environmental experts i spoke with that are travelling with the canadian olympic team say the measure is actually closer to 100 you literally cant see the tops of the buildings today

1990409 oh i like judas priest so ill include their cover even though it is not sick at all
1990410 theres a lot of misinformation so thats why this study is so important
1990411 hundreds and hundreds of parents think this works but we need serious evidence
1990412 a lot of children with autism have gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea whether these problems are related to brain development is open to question
1990413 there are neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors in the gut that correspond with those in the brain there are some scientific reasons to think that some kids may benefit from this diet
1990414 while this indicator is volatile and affected to an unknown degree by foreclosures it does suggest that conditions in the resale market for real estate may be stabilizing

1990425 we made good progress during the first half of the year in achieving our strategic objectives both in operations and in cost savings
1990426 the important thing is that we continue to grow with broadband and mobile connections and with innovative value added services
1990427 sometimes you cant do anything about it you just have to accept it and move on
1990428 ive never questioned what theyre doing and i definitely want to be here
1990429 its the way it goes its the business of basketball
1990430 this is my opportunity to step up and be a leader on and off the court
1990431 the good thing about it is we have a lot of veterans and they know how to adapt how to make it happen and bring along the young guys
1990432 to get to 2010 we have to play the two years in between that and we have to win games and to worry about that i think is ridiculous
1990433 the writer who had suffered from aneurysms and prostate cancer began smoking at the age of seven
1990434 but at least im immune from the worst health hazard in life the medical profession
1990435 it was hard at that point in my life because i didnt recognize or appreciate what she was going through
1990436 but as we got older when she and i would go down to the playground i learned a lot from her because she had the best coaching in the world
1990437 the priority is to see the usa womens team win a gold medal because itll be the pinnacle of our sisters success that shes had on the basketball court
1990438 she doesnt want to be the coach of the first womens team to lose the olympics
1990439 im not sure that shed be a first but you dont want to lose theres a lot of pressure
1990440 i think any coach would be concerned but i think shes very positive
1990441 from what she told me they could win but itll be close there are no run aways
1990442 of course i want to be the flag bearer again
1990443 it is hard for me to separate everything that is happening right now
1990444 to carry the flame is an honor among many that i have had at previous olympics and at this one but it is the kind of experience that i will appreciate most many years from now when i am older and can look back
1990445 i believe it is an honor that will probably go to one of our older olympians or athletes
1990446 someone who was a pioneer they have stood the test of time and have a deeper understanding and sentiment for the olympics and chinese sports i think these people are most suitable for such a historic task
1990447 as hosts we ought to take good care of other teams and its up to you to decide what take good care means
1990448 the live com homepage will rotate olympics images in the background for the duration of the games

1990451 the most points they score are on the fast break
1990452 they did a good job of calling timeouts or substituting when there was a free throw
1990453 usually on a free throw we get the ball and take off and run
1990454 i feel very lucky to be playing water polo i like being part of the team these players are like sisters to me we are a big family
1990455 we see our people succeed at athletics and it is inspiring
1990456 now everybody likes to exercise in china we have been influenced by the olympics
1990457 i needed more strength but i am still too fat
1990458 the nba nfl mlb nhl everyones trying to figure out how to get in here
1990459 but they and also internally the people who run the sports organizations in china say that in order to grow and become viable they need a grass roots development
1990460 and then for each sport they need to find the yao ming of that sport they want that breakthrough golfer that breakthrough soccer player the breakthrough football player
1990461 in the capital city there are more people playing basketball so we came here to play against better players
1990462 we love the game we watch the nba the nba has been very welcoming to china
1990463 sure we would like to play in the chinese national league or of course the nba well see what comes but we just love playing and i think basketball has become a craze here
1990464 chinas athletes have more pressure on them than anywhere else
1990465 not only because the olympics are important to china but because the olympics are here but that also means it is an opportunity for chinas athletes we want them to win but we dont want them to feel the pressure
1990466 steve is a terrific perimeter shooter who will definitely help open the floor and create more opportunities for our post players

1990468 nicht nur rohstoffw hrungen wie der kanadische und der australische dollar sowie die norwegische krone profitieren vom steigenden lpreis sondern auch der euro das liegt an seinem einfluss auf die inflationserwartungen und damit auf den geldpolitischen kurs der ezb
1990469 wir haben es derzeit klar mit einer dollar st rke zu tun offensichtlich haben sich viele anleger neu positioniert und setzen nach dem ende der seitw rtsbewegung auf die us w hrung

1990471 calling attention to the seriousness of safe teen driving in a month that has proven to be the most dangerous for young drivers is crucial in helping to teach the realities of teen driving fatalities
1990472 the fact that we are around and there is a place that people can go will give them some confidence
1990473 unfortunately there are some companies that take a dim view of some peoples freedom to tinker
1990474 in my experience the smaller the company the worse they are
1990475 the kosovo precedent has driven us to more actively seek our rights
1990476 high performing site specific search engine on just about every content rich web site that is worth its salt
1990477 with a growing mass of web content from blogs news sites image and video archives personal web sites and more internet users have an option to turn not only to the major search engines but also to search engines on individual sites as vehicles to reach the information they are looking for
1990478 i would speculate that theres so much information out there that no other organizational tool can manage the volumes of content that people online consume
1990479 search has become an essential utility for almost all internet users
1990480 ninety percent of web users use a search engine at some point over the course of a month a figure that has held relatively constant over the years
1990481 but as search engine accuracy has improved more people are turning to them for their day to day information instead of traditional tools like bookmarks and home pages
1990482 mark udall voted for higher taxes at least 50 times
1990483 udall is fighting for the biggest tax increase in history
1990484 udall voted to block bipartisan energy reforms that could lower gas prices
1990485 we see no reason why they should proceed with the case they should withdraw the charge give me a break i have gone through hell let me go on with my life why torture me in this way
1990486 i advise those around him to leave the sinking ship of his leadership while there is still a chance to do so
1990487 the moment we form the government we will cut the fuel price and free all political detainees we are moving close to forming the government
1990488 that is why they are hell bent on attacking me
1990489 based on reasonable facts i would say we are clearly on track
1990490 it may not happen on that day but we are working on that premise
1990491 child slavery in haiti may be the ultimate symbol of a state that has failed its most vulnerable members
1990492 what does the current rage skin bleaching tell us about our identity
1990493 child slavery in haiti may be the ultimate symbol of a state that has failed its most vulnerable members
1990494 key to ending child slavery in haiti is creating long term economic options for parents and access to quality education for children
1990495 according to the radio news the death of my friend bloneva bethel was the result of a domestic dispute
1990496 i dont work for a party i dont work for a president i dont work for a special interest
1990497 i dont work for myself i work for you and the country we love
1990498 yesterday he obama accused me of having president bushs policies on energy sen obama voted for that bushs bill and its big oil giveaways
1990499 i know he hasnt been in the senate that long but even in the real world voting for something means you support it and voting against something means you oppose it
1990500 the facts speak for themselves john mccain voted with george bush 95 percent of the time and has proposed 4 billion in additional tax giveaways to big oil
1990501 sen obama has a serious plan to end our dependence on foreign oil by investing in a range of alternative energies that will boost ohios economy and create good paying new jobs
1990502 the consumer agenda is almost a survival agenda for many people especially the older those on a fixed income
1990503 we are seeing dramatic food price rises energy prices and anybody who has moved from a fixed mortgage rate will have found their costs increasing quite dramatically
1990504 closed and protectionist european energy markets can end up picking the pocket of consumers up and down this country and thats one of the things we will campaign on
1990505 we have investigative powers the ability to explore complaints of general interest across the economy so we are a watchdog with teeth
1990506 and we have the power to ask for information from companies on specific issues of consumer concern
1990507 they go up but when it comes to coming down they are much slower
1990508 in a number of areas we have got quite sticky markets in the mortgage market and we are seeing it in petrol prices on the forecourt and energy markets
1990509 it will be able to look at more wide ranging market trends and see the bigger picture as well as handling individual concerns
1990510 we think key areas for consumer focus to look at will be competition in energy markets the fuel poor helping people who are vulnerable to disconnection or who have already been disconnected
1990511 talks with iaea in the past two days were constructive and the two sides have reached some agreements
1990512 such talks on irans cooperation with the iaea will continue in the future

1990519 waaaah halo 3 has won it sucks and this is better
1990520 please kids dont think that this was any kind of official award it wasnt voted on by people who are truly knowledgable with regard to the industry or have any kind of influence on it this was voted on by fanboys and you guys have more than we do
1990521 for us smaller clubs retaining players can be a problem and i feel that ashley giles dual role gives him an extra advantage there is no question of ashley behaving improperly hes a splendid fellow and warwickshire have acted totally above board
1990522 the thing is when grav david graveney was a selector we asked him to become involved with gloucestershire but he declined because he thought he must remain neutral i wrote to hugh morris at the start of last week and also raised the matter with national selector geoff miller and at the chairmens meeting i cannot put words in others mouths but i think it is fair to say it was accepted that i have a reasonable point
1990523 this rather eccentric chap has decided he wants wave himself through the tube turnstile with a flourish of a magic wand so hes dissolved his oyster card in nail varnish remover and aims to stuff the chip and antenna into a home made wand undergroundio as harry potter might say

1990530 when we first got the news they were saying it was my dad but it wasnt it was my brother and my uncle
1990531 we currently have company representatives going up to alice arm and into the area to find out exactly what happened and who was on board
1990532 we just dont know yet we hire a lot of contractors
1990533 do i want to be in star wars they ask me yeah
1990534 you get those same cringe moments that we got when we saw porkins and biggs die in the battle of yavin

1990539 aging but painfully badass jedi slowly pushes the bad guy back

1990542 the number of refugees is growing a humanitarian crisis is looming

1990547 any time is a perfect time to bring to life a hero and the spirit is a very good hero
1990548 he is an urban zorro and in a time when were getting very very focused on the gadget and doohickeys and vehicles of the superheroes its great to have a guy with just a hat and a tie and a mask and a pair of fists making the city right
1990549 i did a lot of research i talked to everybody before we put frank in this job i talked to producer elizabeth avellan and director robert rodriguez about what their experience was with him on sin city i mean look we all knew frank was going to be a great visual storyteller hes proven that he drew those things for years that kind of look like storyboards also his style is so strong hes so stylistic but could he work with actors those sorts of things
1990550 my dads a film editor i grew up knowing how to edit so it was a good marriage because there were technical things frank didnt know but hes so talented hes one of the strongest voices and visions of any director that ive ever worked with and all i did was be able to give him some of the technical tools he didnt have we really did work closely together and we had a great time and it was always his vision and we were able to always get his vision up on the screen
1990551 its a completely different day to day experience because when i write and draw i am alone in my studio
1990552 when i am on a movie set im collaborating with hundreds of people and working with the actors is completely different than drawing a bunch of people i made up
1990553 for me you know frank is egoless kind of open to suggestion he likes to laugh a lot and the more outrageous you could be to make this thing happen the more he was accepting of it
1990554 but i am sure nick fury being a guy with an attitude that hes always had will be an interesting character to play when the movie finally has him fleshed out and doing something other than just talking to iron man
1990555 its like ever since i first discovered that they changed nick furys image to being essentially me ive been waiting and going so when do i actually get to do it
1990556 ive been a huge comic fan my whole life ive been coming to comic con for fourteen years
1990557 i thought oh my god i am here i made this happen we have this movie and my dream came true how many times do you get a dream come true in your lifetime you cant be in a better place you cant be in a better time for having made this movie and i couldnt work with better people than frank miller i mean frank miller and will eisner i waited a long time but then i got to do it exactly right so its unbelievably thrilling for me
1990558 after attracting lots of media attention with the eee pc asus has now turned its hand to producing a the trackball requires much less desk space if you dont have room for a mouse pad you have other problems and also doesnt require constantly positioning your hand ive never understood this complaint my mouse pad is 11

1990563 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate
1990564 gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
1990565 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals
1990566 this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
1990567 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
1990568 our next step will be to obtain more structural information about how 14 3 3 shields gab2 once we know that it should be possible to design drugs to combat gab2 activated diseases in novel ways
1990569 it looks at the whole range of risks and looks at them from a national perspective
1990570 it is the first time all of this has been brought together in this way
1990571 the nice thing about embryonic stem cells is that they can make every cell type in the body the difficult thing about embryonic stem cells is that they can make every type of cell in the body
1990572 and so when you push them to specialize they tend to make different cell types were trying to control that process and identify the genes that get the cells down a pathway and then hold them at the start
1990573 our goal is to recreate what happens in the embryo but in the dish
1990574 and so for us this is truly a step forward in understanding what genes can control cell fate and use them to make clinically relevant tissue

1990581 australia appears to be in a safe zone of fertility despite fertility levels being below replacement levels there is no fertility crisis
1990582 much of the increase in the fertility rate is likely to reflect the fact that over the last few decades younger women postponed childbearing and many are now having those postponed babies
1990583 a profound misunderstanding of what the canadian government is doing vis a vis the canadian forces
1990584 this is a silly policy thats being announced its inflexible it wont provide the funds that we need to equip our troops and provide them with the wherewithal to carry on and protect canada
1990585 we have put or committed already more than 50 billion to the canadian forces
1990586 this is for new equipment this is for tanks tactical and strategic aircraft helicopters trucks ships
1990587 weve put forward an unprecedented commitment both financial and moral for the canadian forces
1990588 we can do the math and weve done the math on our end and it doesnt work out
1990589 were going to see aircraft grounded were going to see ships that cant sail and were going to see no increase in the size of our armed forces
1990590 liberal colin kenny said canada currently spends about 18 billion per year but that number should be 35 billion

1990604 are you concerned at all about the fdles investigation and whether the state attorneys office is going to file charges
1990605 approximately 19 months ago i was notified that my office was being investigated for lowering the valuation of certain properties i welcomed the investigation and awaited its outcome over this extremely long and trying period during that time both i and my entire office cooperated fully with investigators and provided them with any information they requested it soon became evident that chief deputy lance larsen was the focus of this investigation based on requests for information about certain actions he had taken shortly thereafter i decided to remove him from any management and decision making roles pending the outcome of the investigation i had placed a great deal of trust in him and felt that with his stellar credentials and background in a high level position within the florida department of revenue such trust was deserved upon advice of the office general counsel joe caruso i obtained the service of criminal attorneys for the purpose of looking into the issues raised by the fdle investigator this was done due to the specialty of criminal law and in order to ascertain the opinions of these attorneys as to whether any criminal violations or criminal intent had been involved in the decisions being questioned they found none and advised that i should wait and see what the state attorney decided to do my office has always given the benefit of the doubt to the taxpayer and if an error in judgment were to be made better it be made in favor of the taxpayer the business of valuing property requires a great deal of judgment and any decision can always be subject to debate however it must be made clear that i have never shown favoritism to any taxpayer in the performance of my official duties nor would i knowingly permit such behavior from a member of my staff in our judicial system everyone is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty and i have faith in that process i am pleased that i have been personally vindicated by this lengthy and exhaustive investigation though i am both saddened and surprised by the decision of the state attorney relative to mr larsen it is not only an indictment of mr larsen but also of the honest and respected taxpayers involved who are members of our community last week mr larsen requested and was approved for family medical leave due to an upcoming medical procedure he is therefore currently on leave from this office and under that federally protected status we must honor such medical situations until resolved or for up to 12 weeks i appreciate the dedication and professionalism of our staff of over 100 individuals with many years of experience i also appreciate the privilege of serving the citizens of brevard county for over 37 years and i welcome their continued support from time to time problems will arise in serving the public but we look forward to the final resolution of these matters and to continuing to provide quality service to the citizens of brevard county

1990663 beijing could win gold silver or bronze depending on whether unpredictable weather patterns blanket the city with pollution or pro tibet activists find a way to make their case heard
1990664 or perhaps it is not so odd when you consider the financially disastrous 1976 games in montreal which it took the canadians 40 years to pay for

1990704 after the massive delays sql server 2005 had microsoft and especially ted kummert corporate vice president of microsofts data and storage platform division were pretty vocal that it wouldnt happen again kummert had said that future releases would ship on a 24 to 36 month cycle and end of summer is basically the outside limit of that window im pretty sure he didnt want to be made a liar in the first major release on his watch
1990705 an interesting question that well learn the answer to over the next few months is whether microsoft compromised quality to get the product out the door
1990706 the sql server team has traditionally been willing to take as long as they needed to make sure releases were solid at this point i dont think there is any particular reason to think microsoft cut corners but they definitely changed the development and test process and that always carries risks
1990707 interesting features for developers and administrators and some things that could help sql server continue its march up market

1990792 when we started the project it was as george said initially a television series and we needed to be able to work at a pace that was pretty rapid
1990793 and the way that we write this is we rewrite we change it and we need to be able to access our actors pretty regularly so it was hard to get all the actors that would be off on set because this pace is pretty intense
1990794 and you cant really afford you know multimillion dollar actors to do a television series the license fee on your average television series is about 200 000 you know its nothing so those guys make more during their coffee break
1990795 we went back to the original actors and we said ok

1990806 i think cristiano realises that we had a good meeting in portugal that clarified a lot of things

1990810 he is happy to be a manchester united player and he has always been happy here
1990811 its just unfortunate that the participation of real madrid in the players life that has made it difficult for him
1990812 decent fightback by the saffers just one wicket down and 85 runs in deficit still not over by a long stretch

1990816 just wondering if theres anyone else listening to the live update here in ouagadougou the wonderfully named capital city of burkina faso keep up the good work
1990817 hello again all update on my swedish pa see 1559 entry its getting interesting i said what is she replied the bubbles dissipating on your beer and in reply to anon 1641 re does my wife know etc im divorced wonder why and after the cricket a home made curry and an episode of midsomer murders sorry to ruin your illusions chaps
1990818 mark how can you say the bbc doesnt endorse gambling whether at work or not when in the very next breath you ask for odds on the fly that was in the bowlers eye being the same fly that was in the batsmans eye 1653 sorry for the delayed response have been doing a spot of work you should be fired
1990819 this is a perfect little spell for england to have a blast at south africa here make them get a nightwatchman in
1990820 that raises a question for the primary club as monty was run out without facing a ball does that count as a primary
1990821 and so englands wicketkeeper non batsman woes continue we could return to prior and ship 20 runs in byes i suppose
1990822 sorry tiny tim you dont look a great gloveman and yer batting is rubbish time for a change methinks
1990823 harmy is doing well brought in to replace vaughan and hes scoring more runs
1990824 i visited the royal tyrrell museum of palaeontology in drumheller alberta canada last week and it occurred to me that civilization as we know it is built on two pillars one is great museums the other is online cricket commentary for wayward souls who live in places where the sport is not well known bless you for your good work

1990827 responding to tims question 1554 the last english born wicketkeeper to score a hundred for england in a test was alec stewart at old trafford on 13th june 2002 where he scored 123 against sri lanka chris reads top score for england is only 55 and as mm said tim ambrose geraint jones and matt prior were all born overseas
1990828 i know the feeling re the swedish pa 1559 my wife is swedish and ive given up trying to get her to understand cricket im hoping she wont try to indoctrinate our 10 month old son
1990829 yet again another example of pietersen at his best and worst wonderful century laps up the applause and then throws his wicket away forgetting that cricket is a team game
1990830 we still have such a large proportion of batsmen out of touch coming to the crease and selectors who refuse to look outside of the favoured and very limited circle that we effectively need eight batsman in the team so prior will get back in the team by default not as a keeper but as a back up batsman he only scored runs against weak opposition last time out so are we any better off
1990831 geoffrey was obviously a great player and servant for his country but next time he starts going on about how runs and wickets against bangladesh and the like dont count and how in his day all test teams were full of great players would somebody please point out to him that until the late 70s fielders often didnt move and certainly didnt run im guessing that the improved athleticism of modern day fielders makes scoring runs a tad trickier
1990832 sorry chaps kps wicket was my bad i wondered out loud to the office when he got his century right how many balls til hes out
1990833 simon 1248 spare a thought for a certain mr a flintoff who played only one test for the icc world xi and took seven wickets including ponting twice and gilchrist what more could he have done to get another game

1990844 the way nel gunther always appears to be on the verge of blowing up and bursting into multi coloured flames perhaps he could be used as the closing ceremony at the olympics instead of a fireworks display would certainly save a lot of money whilst at the same time quite possibly making lots of people very happy
1990845 40 for england v sa at the oval is cheap the scotland v england one dayer at the grange a walled park in edinburgh on 18 aug is 48 for adults 26 for concessions so thats 152 for me my mum and dad and two kids under five i dont think so im considering throwing my scarf over the wall and climbing in as a sort of revenge for wembley all those years ago will lash down most of the day anyway the scots will be hoping for a flukey victory on d l rules

1990852 re tom kendall 1145 while its true we are reigning olympic cricket champions the french side we defeated were made up of members of staff from the british embassy in france so the victors were pretty much bound to be english although knowing england we probably still had a top middle order collapse on the way

1990876 theyve clearly brought nel on to try and wind pietersen up but it might be counter productive
1990877 had a really good day at the oval yesterday but having paid over 40 for my ticket was frustrated we didnt get to see all 90 overs even though the light was fine at the close of play youve probably heard the complaint a million times before and the umpires will say icc rules mean they cant do anything but it seems to me the paying punter and boy do we have to pay sometimes at grounds like lords isnt really considered
1990878 mike gatting would be a useful candidate for the british bobsleigh team for gravitational reasons
1990879 strauss would be a fencer collingwood a rifleman kp would throw a discus jimmy would throw a javelin but best of all cook as a synchronised swimmer
1990880 monty showjumping that celebration could make a final round clearance in any equestrian event
1990881 on the subject of synchronized catch dropping i believe the gold would be ours all we have to do is select the warwickshire fielders from wednesday night i seem to remember five catches going down in the last three overs alone even the fielders found it funny although the bowler was a little peeved until he went to catch one off his own bowling and yes you have guessed it dropped it comedy cricket at its best
1990882 in response to chris smith 1053 a series average of 38 20 would hardly indicate james anderson has matured into a test class bowler neither would his poor career average of just under 35 he has been the best of a very bad bunch this series nothing more
1990883 i could imagine kallis in his present shape doing the shot put or hammer monty is a natural for the triple jump of course and if you include the winter olympics where hayden and symonds would carry off the gold in the sledging
1990884 harmison should take up clay pigeon shooting as he can hit the target
1990885 the monty jump points for style height and number of high fives you can get in
1990886 olympic cricketers see earlier strauss javelin using a stump as he likes to throw his wicket away
1990887 gb are reigning olympic cricket champions in the 1900 olympics france and gb competed for the title with gb winning by 159 runs i dont think it has been an olympic sport before or since
1990888 we dont deserve to win this test a 2 1 series defeat to the second best side in the world would mask a shocking series for england bizarre selection policy total inability to bowl out the south africans twice over reliance on one or two key players our top orders inability to leave the ball properly outside off stump our top orders failure to convert starts to big scores when it counts the list goes on
1990889 i never got the yips but the start of one season after playing for 17 years i forgot how many paces there were in my run up were there 10 or 11
1990890 re impressive numbers 1053 entry has anyone else noticed the date today 08 08 08
1990891 i always walked when i played as soon as the umpires finger went up off i went
1990892 ive always wondered if im the only one watching the match on tv and still following this commentary its not crazy when you try it
1990893 olympic cricketers see 1036 what about ab de villiers and basketball you bounce the ball from one hand to the other via the ground
1990894 monty would make a great rhythmic gymnast with his leap and twirls
1990895 can everyone stop saying that this game isnt worth much or that the south africans arent bothered as they have won the series there is no way that they want to lose to england in the first place and also they definitely dont want to lose when it kps first test as captain imagine the embarrassment back home in sa
1990896 this is light drizzle but we can see some lighter skies coming from beyond the pavilion
1990897 mornin mark just wondering what youd think of adopting the french salutation monsieur and doing a masters course in multimedia and marketing for example youd then be able to go around as m mm mmm
1990898 a strange palindrome saffers 1st innings total and englands overnight score 194 and 49 1 lets hope for some more impressive numbers later
1990899 all the talk yesterday was about the returning steve harmison but james anderson claimed more wickets had the best figures bowled very well im told and claimed his 100th test wicket poor jimmy must wonder what he has to do to get some attention because it doesnt appear to be enough that he has matured into one of our most effective international bowlers
1990900 mom this is the ball from my first f ing win in the majors

1990902 we feel theres a serious intention by the american forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least
1990903 it should not be considered an end to the al mahdi army but its a halfway step to dissolving the al mahdi army if the u s began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution
1990904 as of last night the schedule was one of the issues being discussed between the two sides there is no agreement yet but this is what the iraqis are asking for
1990905 its premature to say what the aspirational goals and time horizons are going to be but we are continuing to work with them on our negotiations on those issues
1990906 through this blessed jihad in yunnan this time the turkistan islamic party warns china one more time our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using the tactics that have never been employed we warn china and the international community for the last time that those spectators athletes particularly the muslims who are planning to attend the olympics please change your intention from going to china please do not stand together with the faithless people the turkistan islamic party volunteers will conduct violent military actions against individuals departments venues and activities that are related to the olympics in china
1990907 our damullah abdul heq made his final order to the person responsible for the military regarding the issue of severely attacking all central cities in inner china particularly focusing on eight cities that are going to hold olympic games ask our merciful allah to allow these brothers and sisters suicide bombers to deal a fatal blow in this jihad against chinese amp we ask our merciful allah to completely stop olympic games bomb chinese government buildings military barracks airplanes airports railways hotels entertainment venues tourist spots and similar places youre even permitted to use biological weapons this time
1990908 obviously this is a situation that is not going to go away
1990909 conversational marketing and social media marketing to me arent truly rooted in marketing at all nor should they be this is about learning from listening first and engagement afterward
1990910 to fight against if the smartest minds in the world say it cant be done do you still try if so why a world where there is no bomb sounds like a dream but im not so sure it works out that way and i find that rather interesting idea to consider

1990915 have tried limiting alcohol advertising once before in this country and it didnt work very well
1990916 taken a very sensible very rationale very conservative approach and weve asked that any company that advertises alcohol during our games continue to include the message drink responsibly on its ads
1990917 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism
1990918 and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or
1990919 there are several issues which mugabe and tsvangirai would have to agree upon before a final agreement could be signed
1990920 it is expected these matters would be dealt with once and for all on sunday and an agreement should be signed afterwards
1990921 if its down for a month that would delay shipment of as much as 30 million barrels of juice which is a huge chunk even amid this demand destruction were seeing

1990924 we need to ban these flimsy plastic bags which we only use once and dispose of because all of them make their way into the environment

1990927 while east tennesseans have been struggling with out of control gas prices david davis has pocketed thousands from oil companies
1990928 why is big oil trying to buy our seat in congress and why is davis accepting their cash
1990929 twenty20 is a very popular concept but we need to manage and contain it
1990930 private entrepreneurs see it as an opportunity to make money but we need to preserve the integrity of the game and make sure it is played on an organised and controlled basis
1990931 india have the money and the audience but they need us because we have player power we have some of the best cricketers in the world
1990932 there is an issue around the timing but the champions league is a fantastic idea and there is a lot of money at stake
1990933 the ipl was a tremendous success and it was huge for the players we released them to play in it but it didnt bring back a cent to us hopefully the champions league will be payback for us
1990934 the ipl icl issue still haunts us and we need to manage better the formation of two domestic leagues in the same country
1990935 it could happen tomorrow to any of the other member countries of the icc and like fifa the football federation we need to have every aspect of the game fully regulated
1990936 we want to give time to the remaining civilians to leave the town
1990937 aimed at restoring peace in south ossetia defending the local civilian population within the peacekeeping mandate we have
1990938 we are forced to restore constitutional order in the whole region
1990939 it is scary we dont know whether georgians are advancing or what
1990940 these are the people whose bodies were seen in their yards and in the streets
1990941 these planes can be used again if the needs comes to hit foreign mercenaries arriving in the region
1990942 now that social media have expanded citizen comment opportunities far beyond the old letter to the editor and talk show call in campaigns should take advantage
1990943 im mike cornfield and im part of the mccain action team
1990944 we are forced to restore constitutional order in the whole region
1990945 when the us launch we could launch in australia and we could launch in new zealand and the uk but if we did that then our colleagues in italy and france and germany and spain would not be very happy so weve chosen to stick to the strategy of doing it pan european and pan australia and new zealand
1990946 and web 2 0 has been around for a few years
1990947 potential of online phenomena to disrupt political campaigns the ubiquity of activists with video recorders say or the likelihood that even a private personal page will eventually find its way into an opponents hands
1990948 can be a liability regardless of whether its visible to the general public
1990949 i do not agree with the sentiment or content of the offensive material especially the bumper sticker that references slave labor it is clear that my actions were juvenile disrespectful and a mistake on my part
1990950 the offensive materials directly contradict the values that my parents taught me and are forbidden in my parents home my facebook page is solely my responsibility and i am saddened that my actions have reflected poorly on my sisters and parents
1990951 my wife and i have initiated a process of firm and severe discipline with our son
1990952 discrimination harassment or any other conduct that diminishes the worth of a person is incompatible with our fundamental commitment as a catholic university conducted in the marianist tradition every person regardless of race color creed national origin gender sexual orientation age or disability shall be treated with respect and dignity no person shall be subject to any sexual racial psychological physical verbal or other similar harassment or abuse or be denied equitable consideration for access to employment and the programs services and activities of the university
1990953 in upholding this freedom for its students the university requires that the expression of opinion not interrupt or disrupt the primary teaching research and administrative functions of the university or any other activity or proceeding on campus which is generally accepted as a legitimate university function
1990954 when justin schaffer became a university of dayton student he agreed to live by the standards of the ud community in the marianist tradition affording dignity and respect to all persons are fundamental core values of the ud community
1990955 as an institution of higher education we also welcome diversity of opinion political dialogue and examination of the issues of the day we encourage those discussions to be respectful of differences new york times
1990956 i saw this article this afternoon on warner music and thought that id write something up about the absurdity of it all
1990957 the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small
1990958 cctv com owns exclusive rights to the broadcast of all audio and video content via online and mobile distribution channels across mainland china and macau
1990959 cctv has committed to protect the intellectual property of the ioc against piracy they are following the china broadcasting copyright protection standard
1990960 too important to us as it affects the economic interest to the international olympic committee the authorized broadcasting operators and the branding of the olympic games
1990961 we strongly believe that safenets drm solution is reliable and could securely protect the intellectual property for the new media video and voice broadcasting
1990962 hopefully all these music parasites will emigrate to crappy countries such as china where they belong

1990966 blimey games ltd would like to announce their continued growth and healthy balance sheets despite 10tacles recently declared insolvency
1990967 we at blimey games would like to announce that this will in no way affect our company or our products
1990968 work on our ferrari project continues and we have also recently signed an unannounced but major brand for a top publisher our studio has recently taken on many new staff and we are very happy to be working on several upcoming and exciting projects
1990969 despite 10ts unfortunate and recently announced insolvency blimey games is in a very strong position we have recently signed an unannounced major project for a top tier publisher which secures our continued growth and our ferrari title remains unaffected work will continue as normal at our studio
1990970 in this industry you have to have reliable up to date daily news and information gamesindustry biz is by far the best source for the games industry its grown in stature over the years and really is the pre eminent site its a highly effective way to market to the trade i recommend it highly
1990971 with this study we looked at a very large population to determine how each individual could be stratified based on his or her dna
1990972 we want to see if the snps tied to a specific ancestry hold any biological significance to populations of different origins we want to see if the snps that we isolated are related to natural selection and adaptation for example to the weather conditions of different regions
1990973 because this method is purely computational and leverages linear algebraic methods such as principal components analysis without the use of information on self reported ancestry we were able to treat the data as a black box
1990974 much of the genetic variation was found to stretch between two points what we speculate is the northern european to southern european ancestry axis
1990975 i dont have any tickets to olympics events but my family and i will watch them on tv we are looking forward to watching the sports that china will excel at like ping pong and badminton
1990976 these types of things happened only once in a thousand years
1990977 ive even bought a small television so i can watch all these football matches in my shop
1990978 we will go home tonight to watch the opening ceremony together because we dont want to run into crowds outside
1990979 its not my olympic games its not the games for the ordinary people
1990980 i want to say something international olympic committee president jacques rogge has said the games will bring fundamental changes to china i will reserve my opinions on that
1990981 i believe that eight is a good luck number but today is 88 days since the wenchuan earthquake so i have my doubts

1990989 we put the challenge out there and bag manufacturers overwhelming responded with innovative products that provide a win win for travelers and tsa
1990990 the road is extremely narrow and if you have to reverse down this is potentially an accident waiting to happen
1990991 i know the roads steep and i know its narrow but there are lots of little roads like that you just have to drive carefully there have been no accidents on that hill
1990992 a health and safety assessment was undertaken and the report confirmed that access to a number of premises is a risk to our staff and as a result deliveries were suspended
1990993 of course they could freeze the earth but that would kill everyone on mars and venus too
1990994 would reduce supply increase the demand for gas and rely on windfall profits taxes on big oil which have been tried and failed miserably
1990995 an extra 3 million to 4 million barrels per day would lower prices
1990996 would have imposed a 4 8 trillion hit to gdp by 2030 and nearly 1 million jobs lost in certain years
1990997 19 1 billion barrels of oil and 83 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas approximately 30 years worth of imports from saudi arabia and enough natural gas to power americas homes for 17 years it should also be noted that these initial estimates tend to be low
1990998 the debate is going to continue all week on the house floor
1990999 society needs a critical mass of intact families to function effectively
1991000 thats why the debates about same sex marriage and cohabiting couples merit more than a shrug of the shoulders
1991001 in an age of guerrilla warfare and counterinsurgency operations many u s officials appear content to overlook the importance of conventional weapons such as the aircraft carrier
1991002 not weapons platforms from a bygone era but rather flexible tools of national security that can offer a vast array of capabilities
1991003 a restricted view of the churchs social responsibility does not provide effective answers
1991004 entire communities can benefit when faith is exercised in public
1991005 the talks have now reached a delicate stage and we dont want any interference why does he want to engage in a parallel process
1991006 menkerios was to have meetings with mugabe government officials and opposition leaders
1991007 but government told him he was not welcome because the mediator was in pretoria
1991008 we will be able to recount the story of each of our cru and give a further quality guarantee to the consumer
1991009 the best blogs have a tinge of obsession about them
1991010 a big hit on the web one of londons obsessives
1991011 we appreciate your concern and therefore we will change the form across all 6 units
1991012 if we didnt react to this or were silent a few years ago today we are no longer silent
1991013 i stress that when we joined international organizations we assumed obligations and are fulfilling them if our membership doesnt please someone let them say so what will happen if were not members in some international organization will azerbaijan fail
1991014 energy needs are increasingly distorting relationships between democracies that consume hydrocarbons and the authoritarian states that produce them
1991015 we are witnessing one of the most promising periods in russian history
1991016 marked a transition from a phase of consolidation to a period of modernization
1991017 the growing complexity of the russian economy has generated the need for predictable legal procedures
1991018 are likely to continue to reform their political system albeit not necessarily at a pace that we try and set for them
1991019 is in a strategic position has real regional weight and has a sufficiently diverse as well as wealthy economy to be a donor country in most senses of the term this kind of country does not take well to lecturing this leaves us room for attempts at persuasion but mostly the need to hope they make the right choices on their own
1991020 i am offering you an immediate cease fire and immediate talks
1991021 i reiterate my plan which was put forward three years ago and which was improved in the following years of virtually unlimited autonomy and self administration for south ossetia
1991022 we will try not to return fire coming from the separatists
1991023 we have already shown such goodwill in the past however this goodwill has not been taken adequately
1991024 during our meeting the general and i spoke in detail about the current situation
1991025 the general is also concerned about the current situation and he says the only way to stop the escalation is through a direct dialogue a meeting he is very disappointed with the refusal of the separatists to take part in the meeting
1991026 russian peacekeepers did everything to make the georgian side stop firing mortars grenade launchers and large caliber weapons on the city of tskhinvali
1991027 but the firing didnt cease and we were forced to return fire we will now do our best to suppress this
1991028 they came up with a new method they shoot at us from civilian objects from schools and hospitals so that in case of return fire that causes damages they can present it as a barbarian act by the georgians
1991029 this is indeed a barbarian act on their part because they carry out their propaganda at the expense of the life health and well being of residents
1991030 im sure that the deepening of the confrontation is not in the russian federations interests it is certainly not in georgias interests
1991031 were currently on target to achieve twice what we aimed for
1991032 being the first programme was always going to be difficult
1991033 the new organisational structure was not in place until the technology had been in place for a few months
1991034 people want to see more renewable energy development and by participating on facebook the users can actually see that development occur it is a unique opportunity to witness and participate in companies going green
1991035 its like a petition with a guaranteed outcome from participation if facebook users get behind this effort they know they can make a change
1991036 for us its an incentive to incorporate green energy in our sustainability strategies
1991037 we jumped at the opportunity to participate in the application
1991038 green my vino gives the community the opportunity to interact with businesses and make their voices heard when people participate in the application theyre telling us that clean energy is a priority for them and well make supporting renewable energy a part of our commitment as a business
1991039 facebook creates the opportunity for collective action towards a goal and we think we have realized that opportunity with this application
1991040 our goal is to leverage the power of social networks to motivate positive environmental action in the business world
1991041 my hope is that this will be so successful that more wineries will become involved broadcasting our message to as many people as possible
1991042 this is part of an effort to bring together the wine community around a common cause

1991053 this may be the first time a physical signature for a personality disorder has been identified
1991054 for the first time to my knowledge we have a specific brain association for people with a personality disorder
1991055 its new and different because its not a lesion or injury to the brain but it is a difference in perceiving information that comes from an interaction
1991056 its not just a matter of bad attitudes or a lack of will
1991057 we have great strength in the area of personality disorders through our relationship with the menninger clinic

1991060 it greatly benefitted bob quinn and his family so we are pleased about the development
1991061 when in truth and in fact the defendant knew at the time he made these statements to the agents that they were false
1991062 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
1991063 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in

1991066 cheye and trinity we support you friends and citizens of berwyn heights
1991067 sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable biocompatible and implantable dont exist today
1991068 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality
1991069 for example at a low cost we could potentially put a bioactive silk film in every bag of spinach and it could give the consumer a readout of whether or not e coli bacteria were in the bag before the food was consumed
1991070 silks spun by spiders and silkworms represent the strongest and toughest natural fibers known they offer many opportunities for functionalization processing and biological integration when compared to conventional polymers
1991071 we have optical devices embedded with enzymes that are still active after almost a year of storage at room temperature this is amazing given that the same enzyme becomes inactive if forgotten and left unrefrigerated for a few days
1991072 of course were incredibly pleased delighted would probably be a better adjective that nintendo approached us but its not an exclusive relationship
1991073 i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there
1991074 oh absolutely yeah absolutely and the reason we say that is the type of capabilities they have
1991075 with six degrees of freedom you can basically make any movement at all and be able to track that in combination with the sensor bar and other sensors included in the wii remote add the gyroscope capability and you have the ability to work in all three dimensions of space
1991076 what youre looking at are golf swings tennis rackets where you can put top spin on balls bowling where you can bowl curves sword motions with forward thrusts and in wii sports resort the throttle ability
1991077 i really think weve just begun to scratch the surface gaming is a huge application but if you think of where motions and where motion sensing can be applied then there are so many applications this is a great time to be in the business
1991078 what we hopefully have done is provide our partner with new increased capability and what were so excited to see and await with bated breath is how that will be used
1991079 of course in wii sports resort is one application but whats the future in gaming i dont know we provided some great capability and well see what happens
1991080 that didnt solve my problem did you even read my questions
1991081 the vendor says its c counter application captures energy and emissions data in real time over an eight week period providing accurate mapping and calculations of emissions from each business unit it application and asset
1991082 however friendfeed socialthing and others are niches of niches without the scale or usability to affect most companies bottom lines
1991083 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
1991084 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
1991085 all this will probably come out as the election progresses
1991086 what is to stop him from doing a 527 on this issue
1991087 carol mccain told the mail on sunday in june 2008 that she was not bitter and that
1991088 she deserves to be brought along for a while on the campaign trail
1991089 im also wondering how mccain could afford two houses on military pay but thats another story
1991090 one way to neuter this would be for him to bring carol along with him for a while on the campaign trail i hope he does
1991091 he refused early release from his torturers in north vietnam until everyone he was with was able to go home
1991092 it should also be noted that he never would have gotten into flight school in the first place given his lousy records and grades
1991093 mccain crashed his first plane while still in flight school in 1958 he graduated anyway due to some help from family influence it should also be noted that he never would have gotten into flight school in the first place given his lousy records and grades without family influence
1991094 for the first time the cleaning of the rivers is going according to plan which will lead to the future prevention of floods
1991095 this is the first study in europeans to show a beneficial association on wet amd from the consumption of oily fish and is consistent with results from studies in the usa and australia two 3oz servings a week of oily fish such as salmon tuna or mackerel provides about 500 mg of dha and epa per day

1991098 vele digitale goederen en diensten worden steeds meer bestempeld als absoluut noodzakelijk vooral in de leeftijdscategorie onder de 35 jaar
1991099 toestellen zoals de iphone dragen ongetwijfeld bij tot de bekendheid en het gebruik van mobiele muziekdiensten mensen die vandaag vijftien of twintig jaar oud zijn zullen wellicht rechtstreeks kopen met hun mobiele telefoon die zal de volgende jaren de drijvende kracht zijn achter de groei van de sector
1991100 weliswaar zullen de meeste transacties beperkt blijven tot bedragen tussen drie en vijf dollar maar toch zal er een voldoende aantal consumenten zijn die hun mobiele telefoon zullen gebruiken om muziek games tickets infotainment en andere digitale goederen te kopen
1991101 dat zal het totale bedrag aan transacties tegen 2013 verzevenvoudigen

1991103 they went forward a slight bit then the aircraft rapidly descended and hit the hillside
1991104 weve talked to pilots of our other two aircraft flying in the area
1991105 so far it sounds to me like visibility was not an issue it was not windy up on that ridge top

1991111 we will not tolerate the death of our citizens going unpunished those guilty will receive due punishment
1991112 the georgian leadership should come to their senses and return to civilized ways of resolving difficult issues
1991113 we think that this is a very serious error of judgment and political blunder
1991114 i hope that the georgian side will reconsider its reckless actions in the area of the georgia south ossetia conflict
1991115 expressed serious concern at the escalation of violence and asked for an immediate resumption of dialogue
1991116 an immediate resumption of dialogue with a view to a ceasefire
1991117 a clear threat to peace and security in the region
1991118 we are following this very closely we are very concerned by how the situation is evolving
1991119 russian conflict escalates russia and pro u s ally georgia were on the brink of war with russian troops and tanks moving into georgias breakaway province of south ossetia
1991120 in case georgia wins arguments for the peaceful resolution of nagorno karabakh conflict will weaken giving place to military counteraction
1991121 the president has instructed prime minister vladimir putin emergency situations minister sergei shoigu and interior minister rashid nurgaliyev to provide humanitarian aid to people affected by the escalation of the georgian south ossetian conflict
1991122 a russian humanitarian convoy has come under fire panic is growing among the local population and the number of refugees is increasing there are reports of ethnic cleansing in some villages the situation is ripe for a humanitarian catastrophe
1991123 we have lost control over some parts of the city
1991124 look see russias invaded georgian territory and started a war against us isnt this exactly what nato is meant to protect against now you have to let us in

1991126 we may find that the ownership of large newspaper media was a failed experiment
1991127 what are you doing to ensure that american troops will not be needed in the region during your presidency
1991128 so my kids wouldnt have to come over and go through this
1991129 and to that i say amen after a long and deadly war americans collectively decided the best course of action to take to ensure that another generation would not have to die on the beaches of france would be to stay and act as a force of stability on the continent it was a long debate with the two arguments coming into the marshall plan
1991130 violence sells i want to see more violence in games the more blood the better
1991131 the violence in goodfellas is against human beings theres rape in movies you see all kinds of f ed up s on film
1991132 information is the business we are in and we have very well developed practices for sharing it around the world
1991133 this may sound good on paper but if we share information we want to know it is shared for a purpose and that everyone is contributing
1991134 it has to be used with a sense of responsibility and we want to know where we are sending it and who is protecting it if our sources are compromised it makes gathering intelligence so much harder and we have a duty to protect information that is passed to us
1991135 the difficulty with the eu is that it is a complex organisation and there are risks in sharing information with countries like bulgaria or hungary that it will end up in other hands
1991136 we share information across the world but we have particularly strong ties with the us
1991137 it is inconceivable that we would share information with organisations that may be flaky
1991138 the us and the uk have a special relationship that involved a close sharing of information and no one else has anything like that partly because it is only the us and to a lesser extent the uk that have intelligence gathering operations with a global reach
1991139 we are not going to get anything out of giving this information to other countries and we are not going to share the crown jewels if we do not get anything back
1991140 the difficulty with the eu is that it is a complex organisation and there are risks in sharing information with countries like bulgaria or hungary that it will end up in other hands
1991141 this is insanity it will have to be built like fort knox
1991142 if a child was to get out of the grounds they could wander on to one of the worst junctions in scotland
1991143 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
1991144 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
1991145 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
1991146 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
1991147 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
1991148 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
1991149 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
1991150 i have frozen them for 12 hours at a time and about 50 percent of them survive
1991151 there was nothing obvious about the body that would tell us anything else but well have to wait for the autopsy results
1991152 he was last seen at home about 9 30 tuesday night
1991153 there is no indication any months sales activity would exceed the alcohol sales limitation
1991154 the intent is to connect residents with the business resources theyre looking for its one more way for ankeny businesses to have a web presence

1991158 this whole sort of fashion evolution since becoming mrs tom cruise i think it has taken her time to find her sea legs
1991159 this haircut is clearly a step in the right direction
1991160 these people are professionals school owners and scholars who are held in high esteem in their country
1991161 we are working with event organizers and we recognize the importance of such meetings especially in quebec city this year but visa officers have to keep in mind the safety and security of canadians when they make their decision
1991162 its ironic but sad when you know that the title of our conference is librarians without borders
1991163 its an outstanding issue and unfortunately its only getting worse
1991164 for some reason african citizens seem to be targeted more than others by immigration authorities
1991165 ive set my sights on providing spectators with one of edinburghs best free shows
1991166 oh yeah well you just wait until year xxxx then well show you
1991167 please buy 3 million or so of these crappy vehicles that we never cared about when we were printing money with suvs and even we admit are terrible which is why we are killing ourselves to bring all new product here in a year or so

1991170 what nintendo have done with the wii is truly fantastic there is no question about it but i think sometimes there is a thin line between gimmick and great gameplay
1991171 weve seen some research that says 60 percent of people who bought a wii fit play it once and dont play it again
1991172 so we have to get the balance right because what we are doing is bringing new consumers into the market for the first time in their lives sometimes and we have to treat them with respect
1991173 i think lips will be a complete failure but i do think there is at least some truth to that 60 number
1991174 i can assure you that the board is unanimous in its support of rick wagoner and the management team to get through these difficult times we truly feel we have the best management team to get this job done

1991179 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights and i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers
1991180 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1991181 young people who grow up with the freedom to trade goods will ultimately demand the freedom to trade ideas especially on an unrestricted internet change in china will arrive on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions
1991182 that doesnt take away from how important the message is
1991183 these were conservative investors thats why they bought these securities

1991202 though there were areas of overlap we found that common motivations for self benefit included interaction with the birds a sense of achievement social interaction personal stimulation and enjoyment
1991203 past research shows that people take part in wildlife activities for many reasons and so require a sophisticated level of management our findings reinforce that
1991204 though self satisfaction motivations were mentioned most often people also had many unselfish reasons for taking part in conservation including helping this vulnerable species preserving nature for future generations and serving the community
1991205 with declining budgets most wildlife agencies are not well equipped to manage the growing number of species at risk so they are depending more on volunteers to help with wildlife management operations

1991239 there have been periods of severe famine even as recently as the late 1960s when tens of millions died of starvation in the back then you would have been glad for what is on todays menu
1991240 when are the midges going to be active and what can we do to put a barrier between our livestock and these midges
1991241 the benefit of these techniques is that until very recently midge surveillance relied upon the use of light traps that sometimes do not represent what is happing on animals particularly well
1991242 all of this work contributes to the aims for better knowledge about culicoides that were set out in the european food safety authoritys scientific opinion on bluetongue published a couple of weeks ago
1991243 bluetongue is a terrible disease of ruminant livestock our farmers have worked hard to contain this virus in the infected areas of the south east and east anglia through vaccination and vigilance but we know that we couldnt have achieved this without the effort and knowledge of the scientists at iah bluetongue shares its transmission vector the midge with other exotic but equally serious diseases such as african horse sickness so any knowledge and understanding of the midges behaviour and breeding patterns are welcome we wish the experts at iah success in their endeavours with this project
1991244 we believe actual launch removes significant sentiment overhang from rim shares amp should counter fears of rampant ad spending that has served as addl stock overhang
1991245 this complicated network of causation has confounded efforts to understand cd says carol nacy ph
1991246 since among other things multiple studies identified the pathogen in tissues of cd patients treating some of these patients with antibiotics that target mycobacteria provided relief from symptoms
1991247 a big challenge for biological therapeutics is that they are broken down rapidly in the body the technology developed by asterion ltd is based on basic structural biology work that has provided us with the knowledge necessary to develop longer acting drugs this is a major advantage for patients as it means monthly injections rather than daily injections
1991248 our patented and versatile therapeutic platform technology profuse tm could also tackle major diseases such as some cancers anaemia infertility and diabetes under normal circumstances hormones of the type known as cytokine hormones growth hormone for example circulate in the blood and are bound to proteins that prevent them from being degraded the basic structural biology work we have done in the past means that we can see the interaction between the hormone and the binding protein in exquisite detail our understanding of this structural information means that we can rationally design drugs that consist of this pairing of hormone and binding protein that still allows them to activate the cell surface receptor in this situation the hormone portion of the drug is better protected in the circulation from degradation and so it has a much longer effective life in the body
1991249 ive always felt that you have an advantage if you can understand a companys product technology or the service it provides and if you understand why anyone would want to buy that product earlier than other investors
1991250 if you had predicted coach would broaden its demographic appeal and parlay that into sales growth you would have had an advantage
1991251 i think individuals can make decent calls on consumer products if theyre on the bell curve of mainstream and can find a product or service that changes behavior and can recognize pop and fizz stories like crocs

1991254 theres a lot of misinformation so thats why this study is so important
1991255 hundreds and hundreds of parents think this works but we need serious evidence
1991256 a lot of children with autism have gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea whether these problems are related to brain development is open to question
1991257 there are neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors in the gut that correspond with those in the brain there are some scientific reasons to think that some kids may benefit from this diet
1991258 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate
1991259 gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
1991260 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals
1991261 this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
1991262 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
1991263 our next step will be to obtain more structural information about how 14 3 3 shields gab2 once we know that it should be possible to design drugs to combat gab2 activated diseases in novel ways

1991279 we would once again rather than attending to the peoples business be engaged in a tit for tat back and forth non stop circus
1991280 the answer better be hell yeah but sadly it sounds like they would push it back to a 2nd term this is worse than fisa

1991312 france paid through loans rather than through increased taxation causing a serious economic crisis when the bills came due that helped trigger the french revolution
1991313 our findings have long term implications for how we teach negotiation
1991314 men who try to make a positive impression by being conciliatory risk forfeiting their own economic outcomes and women who try to make positive impressions by being assertive can risk damaging their relationships thus men and women may benefit from different strategies when it comes to balancing the tension in negotiation between empathy and assertiveness
1991315 if we can learn how team members approach problem solving and how members creative problem solving approaches transfer from the individual to the team and become collective cognitive processes of the team this can enable us to help facilitate teams in trying to be more creative at work
1991316 by understanding how master transcription factors turn micrornas on and off we now see how these two groups of gene regulators work together to control the state of the cell
1991317 micrornas are a special class of molecules because they not only contribute to cellular control but they play important roles in disease states such as cancer
1991318 knowing where genes start is essential to understanding their control
1991319 based on our knowledge of microrna gene start sites we were able to discover how these genes are controlled by the master transcription factors
1991320 we now have a list of what micrornas are important in embryonic stem cells
1991321 this gives us clues of which micrornas you might want to target to direct an embryonic stem cell into another type of cell for example you might be able to harness a microrna to help drive an embryonic stem cell to become a neuron aiding with neurodegenerative disease or spinal cord injury
1991322 we and others are finding that the overall gene circuitry for embryonic stem cells and cancer cells is very similar
1991323 now that we have connected the circuitry to micrornas we can begin to compare micrornas that are regulated in embryonic stem cells to those in cancer cells
1991324 connecting microrna genes to the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of embryonic stem cells
1991325 july 21 28 im going to try your online edition although with dial up internet service its a bit of a drag technology has altered our lives in ways both marvelous and disconcerting
1991326 it started way back when its just grown into its own thing
1991327 east high alums from many different years basically just take the tent over
1991328 whether you are a north south or west sider you know the first friday night of the fair is east side night
1991329 i think the greatest thing about the east siders is that they come to support the fair no matter what the economy is they come rain or shine
1991330 when they tried to scare the bear off it went back into the basement
1991331 they didnt know if there were any people in the home
1991332 its the third time ive seen a bear in the daytime
1991333 we just moved here from toronto in july and it was the first bear we have seen
1991334 its very unusual weve had three bears shot this week
1991335 we want to give the millions of people who will watch the opening as well as the hundreds of athletes taking part the message that there are no human rights in tibet
1991336 1 272 are now in custody and another 100 we just detained are on their way there
1991337 this is the largest number of protesters detained in one day since the protests began in march
1991338 the tibetans continue to try and protest in small groups and as long as they keep coming we will detain them
1991339 tibetans have been dismayed at chinas interference in tibet for a long time this day is an opportunity for us to attract the worlds attention
1991340 ive been coming here nearly every day for the past three months and i will continue
1991341 we sent officers to the scene after receiving a report at 8 21am that a person had hung banners on the tsing yi bridge
1991342 know anything about this company red hat they went public with a 3 billion market cap and near as i can tell their software is free am i missing something how is that a sustainable business or should i short microsoft stock
1991343 researchers have long wanted to find a way to move a patients disease into the test tube to develop cells that could be cultured into the many tissues relevant to diseases of the blood the brain and the heart for example
1991344 now we have a way to do just that to derive pluripotent cells from patients with disease which means the cells can make any tissue and can grow forever this enables us to model thousands of conditions using classical cell culture techniques
1991345 tpa has been demonstrated to reduce disability from ischemic clot caused stroke however the drug is only currently approved for use within three hours of symptom onset
1991346 it is important for people to recognize the symptoms of stroke and promptly call 9 1 1 emergency medical services when they occur
1991347 although patients arriving at the hospital within two hours of symptom onset were significantly more likely to receive a timely ct scan than those who did not 24 percent vs 9 percent most 76 percent did not
1991348 this points to areas where stroke systems of care can be improved in hospitals improvements could increase patients access to time dependent therapies and potentially reduce disability from stroke
1991349 nearly as much money on the value of their property

1991351 its a matter of democracy taking the oath to an unelected person is a nonsense
1991352 i cant see the point of 22 grown men running around a field in shorts chasing an inflated pig skin
1991353 brown carbon spheres in east asian outflow and their optical properties
1991354 because of the large uncertainty we have in the radiative forcing of aerosols there is a corresponding large uncertainty in the degree of radiative forcing overall
1991355 this introduces a large uncertainty in the degree of warming predicted by climate change models
1991356 if we know the optical properties and distribution of all the aerosols over the entire atmosphere then we can produce climate change models that provide more accurate prediction
1991357 the problem with this approach is that it gives the average properties of all aerosol components and at only a few wavelengths of light
1991358 we have used this approach to determine the complete optical properties of individual brown carbon nanoparticles sampled from above the yellow sea during a large international climate change experiment
1991359 this is the first time anyone has determined the complete optical properties of single nanoparticles from the atmosphere
1991360 we show that many of the carbons in our sample have optical properties that are different from those usually assumed in climate models
1991361 when you hear about predictions of future warming or changes in precipitation globally or in specific regions like the southwestern united states the predictions are based on computer model output that is ignoring brown carbon so they are going to tend to be less accurate
1991362 hopefully we can get something resolved ive been saying that for quite a while now i dont want to say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
1991363 i dont know anything other than what happened today on the practice field and i dont want to address any more speculation at this point bretts situation will resolve itself during the coming days i would assume but at this point and time all i can comment on is our football team and what we did today
1991364 were trying to become a great one well do anything we can to get better and if that involves looking at other players by george thats our job thats our responsibility
1991365 just how he was doing where he was with the process things like that
1991366 the players want resolution they want what everybody wants to come out here every day and talk about somebody that is not here and then shows up its gone on too long and understandably so they want to play football
1991367 hopefully we can get something resolved ive been saying that for quite a while now i dont want to say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere

1991376 its all about allocating working memory to the things that are most important
1991377 when something grabs our attention we automatically divert some of our working memory to it in case it turns out to be important in other words it gets the lions share of memory resources
1991378 when we look at a scene we dont remember every detail only the broad gist and one or two specific details
1991379 we allocate very small portions of our memory to the background and far more to the important details if you test people you find that they have very little knowledge of the details of what they just saw because their visual memory is so limited
1991380 limited memory puts clear limitations on what we actually see rather than what we think we see seeing involves looking at objects and storing them briefly in our working memory but that memory is incredibly small so what we actually see is extremely restricted our vision is determined not just by what we look at but by our memory of the scene
1991381 when we decide to look at an object we clearly perceive it as being significant and reallocate our memory to it
1991382 so even though we havent looked at it yet we still remember more about it than the object weve just looked at
1991383 part of the reason these patients may not be aware of objects is because they have very severe limitations in their visual working memory capacity
1991384 without memory devoted to some parts of the visual field patients dont see objects there
1991385 no nose saddles are a useful intervention for bicycling police officers alleviating pressure to the groin and improving penis health different saddle designs may require some re learning of how to ride a bicycle but the health benefits to having unrestricted vascular flow to and from the penis and less penile numbness is self evident
1991386 the a b cs of the journal of sexual medicine awareness bicycle seats and choices
1991387 for the first time we have a prospective study of healthy policemen riding bikes on the job using wider no nose bike saddles for 6 months not only did their sensation improve their erectile function also improved changing saddles changed physiology this is a landmark study for our field that that is important for future riders and modification of lifestyle showing improvement without any active treatment

1991391 if the timing is off the brain wont set up its circuits properly
1991392 the eyes are ready and seeing properly you can rewire now
1991393 the eye is telling the brain when to become plastic rather than the brain developing on its own clock
1991394 the idea that this class of molecular messenger is passed from cell to cell is considered unorthodox in cell biology
1991395 early excitatory input is important to make first contacts between neurons
1991396 the nervous system is recycling an embryonic factor to induce brain plasticity
1991397 the place you put the egg into is actually egg shaped so the thing is completely useless for anything else
1991398 after taking soundings from various people throughout the sport and from within our organisation the rfl believes it is the appropriate moment to introduce this very important award
1991399 rugby leagues values and qualities make the sport unique and we feel this new award will highlight these special attributes and honour those whose contribution to the game has been truly outstanding and upheld these important principles
1991400 throughout his career as a player and coach his courage dedication and professionalism combined with his openness warmth and commitment to his community made him a special individual
1991401 we believe it is a fitting tribute to name the award after mike and in future years the mike gregory spirit of rugby league award will serve to highlight many outstanding individuals within our sport
1991402 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
1991403 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
1991404 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
1991405 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research on key traits
1991406 the numbers on the surface dont look that bad but when you look at what they are showing the situation is extremely tough for toyota
1991407 that the appointing authority be advised that the conduct of mr kimunya is not compatible with that of a cabinet minister
1991408 this is a very brave statement there is somebody attempting to subvert the work of the finance committee and if they will not allow it to be tabled i will call a press conference next tuesday and read the report publicly
1991409 i cannot bend the rules of the house even for the president prime minister vice president or the chairman of a house committee
1991410 the chair speaker marende made a ruling that it be tabled today and we are seeking your indulgence to table it
1991411 the mistake you are referring to is not by mr okemo but by the clerk and we fear that this urgent matter will not be tabled because we are going on recess
1991412 the deputy speaker did something unusual and i can assure you that farah maalim did not complain of not seeing the report the deputy speaker cooked up some ruling to protect somebody
1991413 it is unusual for the deputy speaker to raise such issues which are normally raised by mps
1991414 while this may appear to be a small theft from the standpoint of a criminal
1991415 these individuals are missing the bigger picture of the hazard they leave behind while they may think all they are doing is impacting businesses what they are really doing is putting people at great risk
1991416 we need businesses to get involved for their own best protection
1991417 dont fall under a false sense of security instead reinforce it by making a quick inspection a part of your weekly routine

1991428 so weve been hanging out a while and i really enjoy it i wonder how you feel about it and where you see things heading
1991429 man the weathers getting cold i hope im not alone this winter
1991430 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment these results challenge current practice as endorsed by a national guideline in the uk
1991431 as a direct result of the lack of evidence many couples with unexplained infertility endure and even request expensive potentially hazardous and often unnecessary treatments
1991432 if you do it youve got to let go and just feel it its okay to sort of learn the steps and know what youre going to do with your movement but once you get there you just have to let it all go dont fake it
1991433 the funny thing is that we are really planning to take it slow and havent actually made any plans to do anything yet wedding wise so i think thats the key enjoying it and each other and taking it slow but everyone else seems to think its all moving really fast
1991434 a falling stock market runs counter to the governments efforts to expand domestic demand and galvanize the economy
1991435 i doubt the government can risk losing a substantial share of tax revenues at a time when it needs money to finance various plans for public works
1991436 probably staffed with scholars out of touch with the pulse of common investors
1991437 although the number of hiv diagnoses among men in this group decreased the last two decades recent data shows these rates are on the rise again making it critical that we continue to understand this group in order to guide prevention and education efforts
1991438 when one drinks or uses other substances inhibitions are lowered making people more likely to engage in risky behavior like unprotected sex this is particularly true for young people who often take risks without thinking about the consequences some patients who are newly diagnosed might be in denial which could lead to poor decisions when it comes to sex
1991439 unfortunately such behaviors put the partners of these men at great risk for contracting hiv and unknowingly transmitting it to others
1991440 for the first time weve used rnai to dramatically suppress hiv infection in an organism
1991441 apparently the sirnas kept hiv from entering most t cells and kept it from replicating when it managed to slip inside
1991442 im not saying weve developed tomorrows therapy but this is a major step forward
1991443 weve used a small animal model for hiv and proven that rnai works in that model
1991444 the number one problem with the current antiretroviral drug regimens is toxicity
1991445 overall i see this work as an exciting proof of principle
1991446 this is a strategy that can be developed for clinical applications in humans
1991447 there are millions of individuals living in the u s with diabetes that take injections
1991448 when developing the survey we had two goals in mind the first was to encourage patients to take a more proactive role in communicating with their healthcare team about their concerns regarding insulin injections the second was to dispel the myth that healthcare providers were unaware of or were unwilling to address the quality of life issues surrounding insulin injections it is our hope that the results from this survey accomplish both these goals and that patients and providers will begin talking regularly about these important issues if we can improve the quality of life for 33 percent of people with diabetes who are insulin dependent then we can be one step closer to lessening the impact of the disease on our patients lives
1991449 diabetes is unique in that it requires significant commitment and adherence by the patient to keep it in control if patients are not comfortable communicating issues related to their quality of life over time they may adhere less and less to their regimen putting them increasingly at risk for complications
1991450 as this survey shows a percentage of individuals living with diabetes and taking insulin are altering what they eat during the day to avoid injections or even skipping the injection entirely even if that only happens rarely omission of insulin depending on the circumstance may have an impact on a patients overall health and potentially leave them at risk for serious diabetes related complications
1991451 i am not surprised that many people with diabetes are not talking with the doctors or diabetes educators about their injections
1991452 for years i skipped meals or injections to avoid the hassle and discomfort of taking them but when it came to talking with my doctor about it i did not speak up as much as i could have when i did finally talk to my diabetes educator about my injections i learned there were other less painful ways to manage my diabetes effectively i am so happy i finally said something
1991453 we can only hope that we can do a little better than we did four years ago
1991454 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is the opposite we believe it is a form of harm addition
1991455 i think its pretty embarrassing that he would attend an event that promotes the very things that he criticizes
1991456 he should not have showed up for the endorsement of the who document
1991457 safe injecting sites are not a new intervention but simply a repackaging of existing who recommended interventions such as needle exchanges etc
1991458 they enable known who recommended harm reduction interventions to be delivered and used in a safe environment with the aim of reaching the most marginalized and vulnerable of injecting drug users
1991459 i know women who live in the downtown eastside and who are alive now because of insite
1991460 financially its more cost effective to provide prevention than treatment afterwards
1991461 no vendor can go it alone in uc so im glad cisco is realizing that
1991462 uc is basically a melting pot of communications products right now
1991463 any vendor that has any kind of communications or collaboration tool claims to be a uc vendor
1991464 we are honored that with all the opportunities available to him dave has decided to join the xfa team full time we look forward to his involvement in furthering our creative initiatives and to his successfully expanding our tv developmental and broadcast reach
1991465 i am thrilled to be joining reis sports entertainment and the xtreme fighting association as evp of programming and media development the potential reach of the xfa is endless and being a part of this growth process is very exciting the xfa has some of the best fighters in the world great leadership rabid fans and fantastic branding developing quality tv programming will be a blast with the long upside that exists for the xfa

1991477 the court has confirmed the fact that robert dudley has committed a violation and has been fined
1991478 the floods have completely devastated villages and towns along the kabul river in the suburbs of peshawar
1991479 due to the scale of the disaster the total damage to life and property is still not confirmed we have been working with the government to assess the damages and provide initial emergency relief to the affected populations
1991480 the force responded with small arms fire killing the militants and inadvertently killing four women and a child located with them
1991481 our biggest concern is the lack of safe water and the impact this has on the displaced most of the internally displaced have settled along the shabelle river from where they get untreated water we are already seeing an increase in diarrhea cases in our clinics
1991482 we will focus on sanitation by distributing chlorine tablets and education for the displaced on how to improve hygiene
1991483 so far people have no intentions to return to their homes many report that they are afraid that the violent clashes will resume

1991491 kwame malik kilpatrick born june 6 1970 is the mayor of detroit michigan elected at the age of 31 he is the youngest mayor in the history of detroit as well as one of youngest current mayor of any major u s city along with luke ravenstahl of pittsburgh and adrian fenty of washington d c citation needed he is also the only mayor in the history of detroit and the only current mayor of any major u s city to be charged with a felony while in office kilpatrick briefly addressed the 2004 democratic national convention he is currently vice president of the national conference of democratic mayors and its representative to the democratic national committee
1991492 if he were any stupider or more corrupt hed be mcsames ideal running mate
1991493 he has been on the frontlines doing an outstanding job of gathering together the leadership at every level in detroit to bring about the kind of renaissance that all of us anticipate for this great city and he is a leader not just here in detroit not just in michigan but all across the country people look to him we know that he is going to be doing astounding things for many years to come
1991494 i never heard brian cowen mention a review at talks but accepted there was not the basis of an agreement
1991495 the most disappointing thing of all was that there was no real attempt by the government to try and deal with the union agenda
1991496 it is very much in the hands of employers it will not wash that people on lower pay should carry the burden we will not engage in a phoney war to bring about some result in september
1991497 he could have set down a marker set out his personal commitments to the process rather than letting officials and mary coughlan who has no track record in this area and no credibility to take the pitch

1991500 the central bank will not try to unwind the nt dollars near term depreciation trend as it is finding it difficult to fight a market that favors the us dollar across the board
1991501 the central bank will do whatever it can to stop the nt dollar from dropping too fast but honestly the central bank will not try to unwind the nt dollars near term depreciation trend as it is finding it difficult to fight a market that favors the us dollar across the board
1991502 it will take longer time to gauge the effectiveness and impact of the liberalization
1991503 the nt dollar depreciation will make imported raw materials more expensive and raw material costs are higher than last year and still on the rise
1991504 this gene has been associated with a combination of kidney and eye disease in human patients
1991505 here we found a mutation that affects only the eyes suggesting that this gene might be a candidate for human patients with eye disease only
1991506 a deletion in nephronophthisis 4 nphp4 is associated with recessive cone rod dystrophy in standard wire haired dachshund
1991507 we wanted to produce a large number of disease models for ourselves our collaborators and the stem cell research community to accelerate research
1991508 the original embryonic stem cell lines are generic and allow you to ask only basic questions but these new lines are valuable tools for attacking the root causes of disease our work is just the beginning for studying thousands of diseases in a petri dish
1991509 the core will also function as a technical laboratory to produce these disease specific lines for use by scientists around the world
1991510 the suite of ips cell lines reported by the daley group marks an important achievement and a very significant advance for patients suffering from degenerative diseases these disease specific ips cells are invaluable tools that will allow researchers to watch the development diseases in petri dishes outside of the patients and we have good reason to believe that this will make it possible to find new treatments and eventually drugs to slow or even stop the course of a number of diseases in years ahead
1991511 this report will be seen as opening the door to a new approach to develop therapies
1991512 one of our goals in creating the nih directors pioneer award programs was to enable exceptionally creative scientists to move quickly in promising new directions thereby speeding the intellectual and technical breakthroughs needed to address major challenges in biomedical or behavioral research
1991513 this is certainly the case for drs daley and hochedlinger who deployed their directors award resources to advance our ability to use induced pluripotent stem cells for disease specific studies and drug development
1991514 the cell lines available from the ips core will allow stem cell researchers around the world to explore possible gene therapies for some conditions and will aid in the development of drugs for others

1991528 we are challenging everyone who is rightly horrified by this crime to look into their hearts and consider leaving violence off their dinner plates
1991529 we told them a year ago when it was built that this would possibly happen a council spokesman said we think that exceptional rain means that the sewerage system wasnt able to cope and thats what caused the flooding there

1991533 this is not about removing anything from the classroom although that would probably be the ideal for me but this is about us having equality of access to other views as to how the world came into existence and that i think is a very very important issue for many parents in northern ireland
1991534 she tells us shes all for equality surely if that is the case you cant have one set of interpretations being taught at the expense of others
1991535 ensure that scientific explanations other than darwinian evolution are taught in schools as scientific explanations
1991536 the evidence based approach to scientific theories and knowledge in science lessons and exploring other beliefs about how the world came into existence
1991537 the problem to date has been that we only have a narrow interpretation from an evolutionary point of view as to how these particular stones were formed
1991538 it is the duty of government to uphold gods law
1991539 the aim is to get the timings right between the two machines and in order to do that we will take some beam into sector 2 3

1991550 if we can understand how different sexual systems in plants have evolved we can then begin to understand how sex in general evolves
1991551 humans and other mammals generally have only two sexes males and females

1991566 some ministries have projects in unsecured areas or disputed areas or not yet ready areas
1991567 i think its absurd that were paying for the reconstruction in a country when right at the beginning of the war the bush administration assured the american people that iraqs reconstruction would be paid for by iraq and through its oil revenues
1991568 inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves

1991574 dan kaminsky presented at the black hat conference in las vegas on wednesday and said that the dns vulnerability he discovered is
1991575 mr silva at verisign said even though patches have been put in place this doesnt mean users can sit back and relax
1991576 the biggest gap in security rests between the keyboard and the back of the chair
1991577 the look and feel of a website is not what a consumer should trust they should trust the security behind that website and do simple things like use more secure passwords and change their password regularly
1991578 we have anticipated these flaws in dns for many years and we have basically engineered around them
1991579 its been overplayed in a sense i think it has served to confuse the consumer into believing there is somehow now a way to misdirect them to a wrong site

1991592 i am not asking people to learn to spell these words differently all i am suggesting is that we might well put 20 or so of the most commonly misspelt words in the english language on the same footing as those other words that have a widely accepted variant spelling
1991593 there are enormous advantages in having a coherent system of spelling it makes it easier to communicate maybe during a learning phase there is some scope for error but i would hope that by the time people get to university they have learnt to spell

1991596 in both cases the range between the upper and lower confidence limits includes 1 000 so both schools are achieving average outcomes their performance is about as expected
1991597 no meaning can be attached to an absolute cva value and any ranking of schools by their cva values is meaningless
1991598 the top 100 schools using the contextual value added measure
1991599 scores above 1 000 represent schools where students on average made more progress than similar students nationally while scores below 1 000 represent schools where students made less progress
1991600 a measure of 1 006 means that on average each of the schools students achieved the equivalent of one gcse grade higher in one subject than the average attained by similar students
1991601 conversely a score of 994 means that the schools students achieved one grade lower in one subject on average while a score of 952 means that students achieved on average one grade lower in each of their best eight subjects
1991602 we do occasionally release lists of the most improved maintained schools in the country
1991603 the dcsfs table recognised the impact of the cohort size as it was constrained to schools where 30 or more pupils were included in the calculation
1991604 it also includes a column alongside the cva value giving the number of pupils at the end of key stage 4 the cva value in the final column should be interpreted taking this into account
1991605 the data are only as good as the process that produce them and only reflect attainment as measured by specific exercises undertaken on a specific day
1991606 objections will always be possible it may be argued that assessment is flawed or the exercises test only certain kinds of attainment in certain ways
1991607 imperfect as they inevitably are these assessments have been developed and honed over time and their reliability is high
1991608 and people often only test what they feel they can measure
1991609 banking on camera phones appearing on the market by next year that shoot high quality five megapixel digital photos those photos would be due to a new line of inexpensive image sensors kodak is starting to market
1991610 in a standard cmos pixel signal is measured by detecting electrons that are generated when light interacts with the surface of the sensor as more light strikes the sensor more electrons are generated resulting in a higher signal at each pixel
1991611 in the kodak truesense cmos pixel however the underlying polarity of the silicon is reversed so that the absence of electrons is used to detect a signal
1991612 light sensitivity in the new sensor is enhanced through the use of the recently announced kodak truesense color filter pattern which adds panchromatic or clear pixels to the red green and blue pixels already on the sensor
1991613 this provides a 2x to 4x increase in sensitivity to light from one to two photographic stops compared to current sensor designs improving performance in low light and reducing motion blur in action shots

1991641 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects
1991642 it has been 25 years since the birds disappeared it seems to me the consequences are going to keep reverberating throughout the community if birds are fundamental components of the forest
1991643 these findings could have global implications since forests in areas that have had a decline in bird populations instead of outright extinction might show effects similar to those in the forests of guam
1991644 it seems logical that if there are no birds then seeds are not able to get away from their parent trees and that is exactly what our research shows
1991645 the magnitude of difference between seed dispersal on guam and saipan is alarming because of its implications for guams forests and for forests worldwide experiencing a decline or complete loss of birds
1991646 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other

1991649 with all of the talk about chinas poor human rights and limited freedoms for their people the topic of how horrid their animal rights are has been lost in the mix
1991650 a secret video made by a worker at a meatpacking plant in pasco wash showed that this steer which supposedly had been stunned had blinking reflexes indicating it was still conscious
1991651 start with your problems at home before condemning other countries
1991652 and there are apparently quite a few damaged people who think
1991653 do i care if i burn an ant with a magnifying glass
1991654 the topic of how horrid their animal rights are has been lost in the mix
1991655 anything that has a back facing the sky can be eaten
1991656 i think everybodys aware that there has been a bit of testiness in the canada china relationship in the last couple of years theres been some differences of view on human rights issues our government has been quite open about expressing those views
1991657 engaging in ways that will enable us to continue to express our differences of view but assure that the relationship continue to get stronger
1991658 i think canada has been clear for as long as i have been in government that we would like to see democracy and human rights continue to strengthen in china
1991659 were no shrinking violet on that issue but we dont see the olympics as the venue to make that point
1991660 if you go to the olympic games then you have a duty to speak up with respect to those violations and you have a duty to call upon china to abide by the undertakings that china took and which was the condition for the awarding of the olympic games
1991661 regrettably on the eve of the opening ceremonies of the 2008 olympic games we have neither seen progress toward press freedom nor acceptance of international human rights standards in china indeed if anything we have seen an escalation of abuses in the run up to the olympics
1991662 unless the chinese government moves quickly in a host of areas the beijing games and for good reason will be compared mostly with those of the 1936 games in berlin

1991676 you have to be in some sort of delusional state to think its not a problem

1991681 unless you are willing to recant that and swear allegiance to the party nominee john mccain we are compelled to request your resignation from the republican committee
1991682 i think people do expect committee people in particular to be loyal to the party
1991683 mr ting has been a very loyal republican and has carried water for the party on a number of occasions

1991690 weve seen some research that says 60 per cent of people who bought a wii fit play it once and dont play it again
1991691 so we have to get the balance right because what we are doing is bringing new consumers into the market for the first time in their lives sometimes and we have to treat them with respect
1991692 we have to ensure that the peripheral strategy that anyone employs makes sense and delivers a truly game changing experience because if its just okay it will end up in the cupboard under the stairs
1991693 if you look at what people dont like about existing karaoke games its that youve got wired microphones which look like theyve come out of a toy shop and a fairly restricted song base
1991694 when we designed lips we looked at those two major barriers we created the wireless mics which look and feel like real microphones have motion sensors so you have more opportunity to get fun out of it because you can use it as a percussion instrument and even light up then we added in the opportunity to sing along to your own music library and have pdlc on top of that

1991702 we wanted to produce a large number of disease models for ourselves our collaborators and the stem cell research community to accelerate research
1991703 the original embryonic stem cell lines are generic and allow you to ask only basic questions but these new lines are valuable tools for attacking the root causes of disease our work is just the beginning for studying thousands of diseases in a petri dish
1991704 the core will also function as a technical laboratory to produce these disease specific lines for use by scientists around the world
1991705 the suite of ips cell lines reported by the daley group marks an important achievement and a very significant advance for patients suffering from degenerative diseases these disease specific ips cells are invaluable tools that will allow researchers to watch the development diseases in petri dishes outside of the patients and we have good reason to believe that this will make it possible to find new treatments and eventually drugs to slow or even stop the course of a number of diseases in years ahead
1991706 this report will be seen as opening the door to a new approach to develop therapies
1991707 one of our goals in creating the nih directors pioneer award programs was to enable exceptionally creative scientists to move quickly in promising new directions thereby speeding the intellectual and technical breakthroughs needed to address major challenges in biomedical or behavioral research
1991708 this is certainly the case for drs daley and hochedlinger who deployed their directors award resources to advance our ability to use induced pluripotent stem cells for disease specific studies and drug development
1991709 the cell lines available from the ips core will allow stem cell researchers around the world to explore possible gene therapies for some conditions and will aid in the development of drugs for others

1991723 the two sestrin genes appear to be the missing piece of the puzzle that explains how p53 can inhibit the mtor pathway and thereby negatively regulate cell growth
1991724 we have now shown that in addition to controlling ros accumulation sestrins and p53 also inhibit cell growth by inhibiting the activity of mtor this explains how p53 functions as a potent regulator of so many aspects of cell physiology and provides protection against dna damage and stress

1991738 in these complex genetic diseases were so ignorant at the moment we dont even know when a patient gets diabetes if they all get it the same way
1991739 there could be 50 different ways to get type 1 diabetes
1991740 the weak point where you could try to prevent or treat it
1991741 we have good reason to believe that this will make it possible to find new treatments and eventually drugs to slow or even stop the course of a number of diseases
1991742 were many years from that but that in itself is exciting
1991743 you can culture them forever its an immortalization of that patients disease as embodied in the cells in the petri dish
1991744 they represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and no good animal models for the most part
1991745 one of the major goals of stem cell research has been to create these cell based models of human disease and this is really the paper that says here they are heres a first set of a large number of different disease conditions making it possible that these repositories will grow and be very substantial representations of human illness for biomedical research
1991746 the beauty would be that youre taking the persons own cell so if you correct it a genetic level by putting it back in those cells wont be rejected
1991747 it gives you a live cell model of the disease so that you can actually test them youre not just watching them as an observer youre actually interacting with them

1991750 the majority of hospitals do not bill us for never events but given the complexity of billing billing systems and billing agencies some never events may slip through
1991751 with this new policy in place we can work to close the gaps and also focus on improving quality
1991752 we are committed that patients and payers not pay for care related to a never event that was within the hospitals control and preventable
1991753 idea that forcing hospitals to absorb those costs will create an incentive to improve quality of care in a business where money typically rolls in regardless of patient outcomes
1991754 cannot bill the beneficiary for any charges associated with the hospital acquired complication
1991755 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region that is very industrially active
1991756 capmex is going to be the very first uav campaign in east asia for air pollution and cloud interaction studies
1991757 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
1991758 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming
1991759 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
1991760 ramanathans earlier research on atmospheric brown clouds demonstrated their importance in how solar energy is distributed throughout the polluted regions of our atmosphere
1991761 capmex takes his work an important step forward with new innovative micro and nano sensor technologies that will provide additional quantitative estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region
1991762 the publication of the 2007 scottish household survey shows a slight decline in the number of people smoking in scotland down from 25 per cent in 2006 to 24 7 per cent last year
1991763 however the relationship between smoking and deprivation is again highlighted with 43 per cent of people in the most deprived areas lighting up compared to just 12 per cent in the more affluent
1991764 the figures clearly demonstrate smoking prevalence declines as deprivation reduces although it is good news smoking rates are continuing to fall overall across scotland more needs to be done to narrow the gap between the haves and have nots in our society
1991765 i think we could have avoided at least some of this if we had agreed to do the town hall meetings
1991766 our polling tells us that americans are still not tuned into what the candidates might do to fix the economy
1991767 is that both the conventions and the debates will offer formats for senator mccain and myself to make our best case to the american people at a time when the american people will be paying attention
1991768 and ultimately the best corrective to overly negative campaigns are the american people who are not interested in a lot of bickering but are interested in whos got the best answers for the country
1991769 i know you guys want more characters for the beta but unfortunately its technically not possible for the patch
1991770 rather than pure text based information we want shiny animated things images and short videos where the information itself no longer plays the key role
1991771 i am really pleased to be involved with the silicon comrades and such a worthwhile cause what we experience is actually normal life for the unfortunates that byte night aims to help i hope what we do and the people we browbeat to support us makes a difference however small
1991772 i had known about byte night for a few years but had never got around to getting involved having taken the time now to find out more this is a fantastic opportunity for the whole it sector to support those most vulnerable teenagers nch can help people the same age as my kids who have fallen through other support networks and stop them getting into the downward cycle from sleeping rough
1991773 beavers are best known for their natural trait of building dams
1991774 with the tag lines la vie est bell in quebec and today just got better in the rest of the country canadas largest phone company hopes to reposition itself against formidable competitors in the wireless tv internet and land line communications market
1991775 its a straightforward and customer focused brand that directly supports the bell teams goal
1991776 to be recognized by customers as canadas leading communications company
1991777 bell not so sympatico has issued a script it expects reps to follow when theyre trying to talk angry customers out of
1991778 mrs mr customer you can certainly speak with a supervisor if you need to however i assure you that we stand behind our network management policy bell has the right to manage its network to deliver a consistent and reliable experience to all its customers and doing so is not a material change to the service
1991779 i worked at a third party call center taking bell tech and billing calls for qc and on customers
1991780 how did they ask you to handle questions about p2p throttling
1991781 in an effort to provide consistent service to our customers we ensure that network resources are shared fairly
1991782 i dont care that it doesnt work just keep on doing it anyways
1991783 we dont know how to fix the company so well play marketing games to try to hide our problems from the customers
1991784 the team has been working feverishly reviewing the film every step of the way to ensure as authentic experience as we can provide
1991785 the environment is absolutely massive the north field alone is huge and will provide some exciting battle moments the base itself is labyrinth of tunnels and rooms
1991786 i was going to announce vehicle combat at fan faire but it seems that that secret was too good to keep under wraps
1991787 yes we are including vehicle combat in the battle of echo base to find out what vehicles on hoth are available for battle youll need to attend the galactic assembly presentation at fan faire
1991788 the good news is that we are seeing stability across it positions as a whole with no further significant drops since the beginning of the year in fact an increase in networking positions is a positive sign that infrastructure projects are still going ahead
1991789 having some sense of job stability was often at the forefront of an employees job hunting criteria so these results perhaps indicate a change of values
1991790 get better advice before buying and not to buy for buyings sake
1991791 what youre seeing is much larger entities obtaining money for data retention note that this is in the run up to the time when the mobile companies and telcos had to move to retaining data for a year whereas one might suspect that 2004 was all about tiny little isps

1991798 i cant put my finger on what exactly but something about that girl makes me think of the 16th century ducal courts of dusseldorf home of anne of cleves
1991799 no excuses after the first two events id just spent all my biscuits
1991800 and word coming out of the us camp is that dladedah tubbs who all comered when semi finalling in the 400 metres has positived until wada have b sampled we cant start scandaling but im hearing some of the media in america have already furore ed and im sure we can expect some real controversying in the next 24 hours
1991801 anyone who watched the late florence griffith joyner benchmarking for olympic fingernail length in los angeles will be excited by this one

1991807 the composition and dynamics of north atlantic communities will change
1991808 but whether that will help or harm local fisheries is an open question humans may have to adapt as well
1991809 the interesting thing to me is that the fossil record has something to say about the consequences of global warming
1991810 i am at one with myself in control of my destiny and fully qualified to tell others how to live their lives
1991811 it will be the canvas on to which tableaux will be created
1991812 it looks like something you might have pulled out of your wardrobe in the eighties
1991813 this opening ceremony may be even more spectacular than the lion king maybe
1991814 we can go into space and we can host the olympics
1991815 the disgraced athlete marion jones had dual belize us citizenship she may well be watching from a prison cell in texas

1991819 unlike in london the torch arrives without a phalanx of blue tracksuited goons
1991820 it was hitler in 1936 who initiated the torch relay
1991821 i think thats supposed to be a printing press something else the chinese claim to have invented before anyone else i think caxton might have something to say about that

1991833 the competition was so close japan were battling ussr for the gold and i didnt want the team to lose concentration worrying about me
1991834 i knew that if my posture was not good on landing i would not receive a good score i knew i must try to forget the pain
1991835 my will to live completely overcame my desire to win
1991836 in the hungarian olympic trials for the 1960 rome olympics the fencing committee told gerevich that he was too old to compete he silenced them by challenging the entire sabre team to individual matches and winning every match he missed the finals of the 1960 olympic individual sabre event and a possible individual gold medal by a single touch
1991837 he has another family in another state and has been living two lives
1991838 these were conservative investors thats why they bought these securities
1991839 were aiming for italy to have a profit making national carrier
1991840 we have a plan we have the shareholders we have the necessary funds were talking to a large foreign company to form an alliance that would make a difference internationally
1991841 harmison also aimed a barb at two ex england captains in the sky commentary box for suggesting that the groove he located was purely a result of getting overs under his belt at domestic level
1991842 nasser hussain and athers mike atherton can sit there and say playing county cricket got me to where i am now but its not the be all and end all i always believed id get back to the england side now ive put the ball back in the selectors court
1991843 mpvyorks has some inside knowledge of working with harmy and mpvyorks would say that hes lethal on his day mpvyorks is also keen on giving players nicknames that end in a y but cant decide if that means mpvyorks should be mpvyorkys or mpvyorksy
1991844 lets see how good he is when the world and his wife has watched super slo mo of the action over and over again
1991845 omg barack u r 100 lush and awesome me and my m8s luv ur plans to simplify filing of income tax returns by pre filling wage and bank information already collected by the irs ur wife is well lucky
1991846 from the runway to the catwalk everything is possible for tyra banks
1991847 ms banks would bring some fierce grace to the white house but she would be ever of the people
1991848 shes not a ha ha ha type i like that shes tall
1991849 i had a woman come up to me when i was seeing rent once she told me she was going to commit suicide until she saw banks show i held her hand and cried with her in the aisle
1991850 from the runway to the catwalk everything is possible for tyra banks
1991851 for the first time weve used rnai to dramatically suppress hiv infection in an organism
1991852 apparently the sirnas kept hiv from entering most t cells and kept it from replicating when it managed to slip inside
1991853 im not saying weve developed tomorrows therapy but this is a major step forward
1991854 weve used a small animal model for hiv and proven that rnai works in that model
1991855 the number one problem with the current antiretroviral drug regimens is toxicity
1991856 overall i see this work as an exciting proof of principle
1991857 this is a strategy that can be developed for clinical applications in humans
1991858 the cartoons were not simply stuck in the middle of the magazine with no purpose or related story
1991859 we wanted to produce a large number of disease models for ourselves our collaborators and the stem cell research community to accelerate research
1991860 the original embryonic stem cell lines are generic and allow you to ask only basic questions but these new lines are valuable tools for attacking the root causes of disease our work is just the beginning for studying thousands of diseases in a petri dish
1991861 the core will also function as a technical laboratory to produce these disease specific lines for use by scientists around the world
1991862 the suite of ips cell lines reported by the daley group marks an important achievement and a very significant advance for patients suffering from degenerative diseases these disease specific ips cells are invaluable tools that will allow researchers to watch the development diseases in petri dishes outside of the patients and we have good reason to believe that this will make it possible to find new treatments and eventually drugs to slow or even stop the course of a number of diseases in years ahead
1991863 this report will be seen as opening the door to a new approach to develop therapies
1991864 one of our goals in creating the nih directors pioneer award programs was to enable exceptionally creative scientists to move quickly in promising new directions thereby speeding the intellectual and technical breakthroughs needed to address major challenges in biomedical or behavioral research
1991865 this is certainly the case for drs daley and hochedlinger who deployed their directors award resources to advance our ability to use induced pluripotent stem cells for disease specific studies and drug development
1991866 the cell lines available from the ips core will allow stem cell researchers around the world to explore possible gene therapies for some conditions and will aid in the development of drugs for others
1991867 the idea of a knowledge of staff notation being completely absent from the most important exams of your childhood is disgraceful
1991868 i used to write for small orchestras when i was 15 i sold my soul to the devil and became a pop star and forgot about it but in the past few years i have got back into orchestration after an almost 20 year hiatus im so slow now and if id just kept it going i think anyone interested in music should be forced to learn that discipline
1991869 if you dont learn to read music then theres a whole tradition that becomes very exclusive and shouldnt be
1991870 there was a point where most people could read music you had to be able to read music to hear new music in essence thats obviously not the case now but it shouldnt be something made to feel old fashioned it should be vibrant and positive of the future not the past
1991871 noel gallagher took the piss out of it and was quoted in the 33 1 3 on ok computer
1991872 its worth mentioning i suppose that learning to read music is not necessarily a path to musicality or musical proficiency to release the musicality in children or to cultivate their musical creativity need not be done through reading music at a young age there is the age old argument that classically trained musicians have been retarded in their ability to improvise and access their own musical flow often made by the musicians themselves
1991873 a useful helpful technical skill as part of a musical education
1991874 researchers have long wanted to find a way to move a patients disease into the test tube to develop cells that could be cultured into the many tissues relevant to diseases of the blood the brain and the heart for example
1991875 now we have a way to do just that to derive pluripotent cells from patients with disease which means the cells can make any tissue and can grow forever this enables us to model thousands of conditions using classical cell culture techniques
1991876 they dont grow like weeds theyre more like orchids you really have to tend to them
1991877 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment these results challenge current practice as endorsed by a national guideline in the uk
1991878 as a direct result of the lack of evidence many couples with unexplained infertility endure and even request expensive potentially hazardous and often unnecessary treatments
1991879 we want to give the millions of people who will watch the opening as well as the hundreds of athletes taking part the message that there are no human rights in tibet
1991880 1 272 are now in custody and another 100 we just detained are on their way there
1991881 this is the largest number of protesters detained in one day since the protests began in march
1991882 the tibetans continue to try and protest in small groups and as long as they keep coming we will detain them
1991883 tibetans have been dismayed at chinas interference in tibet for a long time this day is an opportunity for us to attract the worlds attention
1991884 ive been coming here nearly every day for the past three months and i will continue
1991885 we sent officers to the scene after receiving a report at 8 21am that a person had hung banners on the tsing yi bridge
1991886 at house of speed we feel as though were winning if an individual becomes a better athlete but true victory can only be achieved through making that individual a better person
1991887 to be able to bring a house of speed franchise to the northern virginia area is an absolute joy and blessing
1991888 our partnership with the sports network and fitness and hoop magic is just another chance to influence young people in a positive way
1991889 bringing this program to northern virginia is a tremendous opportunity this program offers not only expertise in speed training and overall physical skill development but its what we do in building character with young athletes that sets us apart
1991890 our reputation has reached the highest levels of sports and we continue to strive for new heights with our state of the art training programs we look forward to being in green bay to enhance performance and abilities in all sports by developing character and sportsmanship we are giving the keys to athletic success in achieving this we can help place athletes one step ahead of the majority of competitors they face the speed and athletic performance we teach will only widen the gap

1991895 it was annoying and difficult to be trying to fight a tough golf course and have eye aggravating me at the same time
1991896 theres only one guy whos going to like this place by the end of the week
1991897 the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
1991898 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
1991899 i sound as if im moaning which i am but its a great shame
1991900 its a fantastic golf course they are great greens and they are playable but there is no need to play it as it is
1991901 try to remember that i actually can play golf even though it didnt look like that on the first hole
1991902 my caddie said remember we played with tiger in the u s open and i think he took six down the first hole pretty much every day so you can shoot a good round from here as well
1991903 this is one of the clubs that prides itself on how hard it is i dont think anyone expected it to be easy it wouldnt be a monster if it was
1991904 if you had rees jones redo scrabble hed leave out the vowels
1991905 to stop the ball on that green when theres a lot of breeze from behind that was good
1991906 and you do need to hit a lot of drivers on this golf course
1991907 does this mean that it is the chinese embassy that decides who has the right to demonstrate in paris
1991908 tina brown and i had an excellent chat before hillary showed the senators biographer has been busy showing her mock up of a new journalism website to entrepreneur barry diller it will be called the daily beast in homage to evelyn waughs classic novel scoop and barry i suppose will play the role of the beasts lord copper
1991909 the salesman got the sale because he made me feel important

1991912 this is the third officially working dog shelter in the capital
1991913 was never told overtly or covertly girls couldnt do everything
1991914 we have four projects right now that are what we call construction ready we could install them and get them up and running by spring 2009
1991915 but none of our financial institutions will finance these projects with just the hope that the tax credit will be renewed
1991916 with solar we can put things in place a little more quickly so you are seeing a tremendous jump in solar installations right now
1991917 it is driving up the cost of solar panels and installations
1991918 1 this is example of a reason you need democrats liberals running your country
1991919 we always remember you tim thank you so much for all your dedicated work in this world r i p
1991920 was just thinking today how much i miss you even though i didnt know you personally
1991921 i was disgusted by mr schrotts previous disregard for his audience and his contractual obligations but to then turn down an offer to settle by making a payment to charity is a new low even for him therefore proceedings have now been issued in the high court and we await his return to the uk so that they can be served
1991922 hes a fool he refused to explain why he was cancelling now hes hiding from me but im going to hunt him down
1991923 the office of prophet of doom of the 21st century
1991924 sometimes it gives you a glimpse of whats in store for the coming year and many times it reveals a tidbit that has never before been released and isnt in the news
1991925 it may fill you in on developments that have happened since december 31 for example the company may reveal that its been working on a new contract or product we think its a neat thing to read
1991926 now people can even ride their bicycles here from wanhua
1991927 people drank about a third more back in the 50s and 60s than they did in the 70s up to 2004
1991928 by understanding how master transcription factors turn micrornas on and off we now see how these two groups of gene regulators work together to control the state of the cell
1991929 micrornas are a special class of molecules because they not only contribute to cellular control but they play important roles in disease states such as cancer
1991930 knowing where genes start is essential to understanding their control
1991931 based on our knowledge of microrna gene start sites we were able to discover how these genes are controlled by the master transcription factors
1991932 we now have a list of what micrornas are important in embryonic stem cells
1991933 this gives us clues of which micrornas you might want to target to direct an embryonic stem cell into another type of cell for example you might be able to harness a microrna to help drive an embryonic stem cell to become a neuron aiding with neurodegenerative disease or spinal cord injury
1991934 we and others are finding that the overall gene circuitry for embryonic stem cells and cancer cells is very similar
1991935 now that we have connected the circuitry to micrornas we can begin to compare micrornas that are regulated in embryonic stem cells to those in cancer cells
1991936 connecting microrna genes to the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of embryonic stem cells
1991937 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody should have told him im a fucking rockstar
1991938 i could no longer give the coach a guarantee that i would still be playing football after my one year contract with stuttgart expires
1991939 while rational drug design remains a perfectly valid way to develop cancer therapies we also need approaches that are less costly and more productive of new effective treatments
1991940 you could say this is more of a guerrilla approach instead of screening millions of untested compounds for an agent that inhibits or stimulates a particular molecular target we chose to screen a large library of already approved drugs for novel activity against melanoma cells and then advance the most promising candidate rapidly to clinical practice
1991941 our ability to identify novel treatments for melanoma and advance them rapidly into the clinic very much depends on nyus multidisciplinary approach to melanoma care and research
1991942 to be effective translational medicine cannot be unidirectional discovery moves continuously back and forth between the clinic and the bench we are now focused on determining the range of doses to be tested in the clinic whether specific types of melanomas will respond better than others and whether combining mebendazole with other agents will be of further benefit
1991943 lawmakers missed the july 30 deadline the 20th day since the president asked them to examine the candidates nor had they finished confirmation hearings by a new aug 5 deadline set by the president so the president appointed the three ministers to fill the vacuum in government
1991944 those who decide to use medical services paid by the national health insurance fund must reinstate their health insurance rights by making installments for six months or paying one time the amount equal to 12 installments calculated on the basis of the minimum monthly sum paid by self insured individuals
1991945 its going to be a good time let me tell you
1991946 according to pasi the us army also plans built a residential complex close to the city of sliven where its rangers stationed in bulgaria would reside
1991947 the information is available that various albanian groups in the states of the region are coordinating efforts to march off together to further reshape balkans borders
1991948 it is evident that as a result of the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo the province is splitting the kosovo serbs that didnt embrace independence have established their own institutions of power at places of residence
1991949 because these people are armed and the civilians might panic if there is a sudden repositioning
1991950 i do want the judge to accept my guilty plea
1991951 the current political advantage of the republican party stems from the ability of its candidates to develop signature ideas this strategy is rewarded even when the electorate has ideological reservations
1991952 a rational electorate is reluctant to support someone who does not exhibit commitment to some ideology
1991953 voters rightly perceive that someone without ideological commitment cannot have developed a valuable political program
1991954 to attract a majority of votes parties cannot simply try to appear median quite the contrary
1991955 winning an election is generally about crafting a convincing philosophy that the electorate will view as superior to that of the opponents
1991956 we do not know whether this mechanism is active or what exactly it does
1991957 it might vaporise applications it might simply prevent them from using the gps it might do nothing except upset the privacy advocates who dont like their iphone calling home
1991958 for all we know it could trigger world war three or it could cause some computer somewhere to spit out recipes for buttermilk pancakes
1991959 we dont expect that a provider is going to know everything about every nationality
1991960 the critical thing here is developing sensitivity and the understanding that not every culture responds to medical providers in the same way sees medicine in the same way
1991961 the tractor trailer was northbound on the highway and the tour bus was southbound and they collided the bus entered the west ditch of the roadway eleven people from the coach and the driver of the tractor trailer were transported to lindsays ross memorial hospital and one was taken to hospital with serious but non life threatening injuries
1991962 damage to the bus was to the drivers side the drivers corner area and windshield and damage to the other side where it entered the ditch damage to the tractor trailer was also on the drivers side
1991963 he appears to be cognizant of his surrounding and acknowledged his partner spencer

1991965 the success of suicide bombers considerably depends upon surprise and accessibility to targets
1991966 both of these requirements have been met by using women
1991967 yet key policymakers ignored the signs in some cases even nudging the bubbles along by endorsing the practices that inflated them

1991974 it would be this unlikely to see the value that i observed given that the data were actually generated by the null data generating process so we should think that some other process generated the data
1991975 every organism of this species has the same string of base pairs here
1991976 theres generally either no red balls one red ball two red balls etc but not generally a whole fucking bunch of red balls
1991977 i think there really are more red balls in this bucket than in that other bucket and not just from random fluctuation
1991978 i get a p value of 08 for tissue type a and 04 for tissue type b is this a significant difference
1991979 i was addicted to doing it i didnt care who it was i just had a mission

1992013 would you like to use a gift or merchandise card or apply a coupon
1992014 the bunkers are completely flooded we cleared the water away from some greens and some are perfect with thunderstorms expected in the afternoon it would be unfair to commence the second round
1992015 our brand promise centers on the idea that its not banking as usual at flagstar we are essentially communicating the reality of what our customers are experiencing every day at flagstar
1992016 our new campaign theme line the new wave in banking reflects our genuine understanding that people are different and want different things from their bank
1992017 this new branding not only positions flagstar as innovative but the advertising itself is innovative
1992018 the look feel and tone are so original and arresting there soon wont be anyone who doesnt know of flagstar and understand what flagstar stands for

1992020 we will be coming out with an ad campaign and a road show to promote indias tourism it will highlight the culture and heritage of the country which are the usps of our country
1992021 we should show our hospitality india is famous for it even if there are some incidents we should take steps to sensitise people

1992027 7 scariest women of weightlifting at the 2008 olympics games
1992028 you got a look on your face like i just finger banged your cat
1992029 some men myself excluded love to be beaten and spat upon by the women their type is called a
1992030 she said when i do it with everyone im exhausted and it hurts but when i do it myself its easy
1992031 youre focusing on the music rather than your breathing or what youre doing
1992032 if youre just making sure you get 45 or 60 minutes of aerobic exercise in to burn calories you want to distract yourself youre not even thinking about exercise and all of a sudden youre done
1992033 two buffaloes had gotten loose from somewhere i dont know where they belong it doesnt look like deputies found the owners
1992034 sql server 2008 is the only major database that includes comprehensive tightly integrated functionality for data management as well as advanced business intelligence out of the box
1992035 by offering a complete solution we save customers time and money and allow them to focus on deriving the most value from their data assets
1992036 you dont really see these scenes with me in germany but thats normal in china
1992037 and i am quite popular because i am one of the main rivals to the chinese i hope there wont be too much going on over the next days so that i can concentrate on my events
1992038 and that would make me more confident for the singles i have trained well now i must only keep my nerves under control
1992039 i am really looking forward to the opening ceremony because i wasnt part of it the last two times
1992040 i am a dirk nowitzki fan the decision is great
1992041 we spent most of last night working on a fix for a worm which was targeting people on facebook and placing messages on walls urging users to view a video that pretends to be hosted on a google or youtube website weve identified and blocked the ability to link to the malicious websites from anywhere on facebook
1992042 you must see it lol my friend caught you on hidden cam
1992043 the security team is always happy when we see spammers complain that it is too hard to make a profit from facebook were also happy when we hear from our users that they consider us a safer place to be online
1992044 finally just as in your off line community be aware of your surroundings in your online community if a user doesnt seem right or says or posts something that you feel is threatening or inappropriate report it to us
1992045 its exciting because weve found a compound in nature that may one day surpass a currently marketed drug or could become the structural template for rationally designed drugs with improved selectivity
1992046 the ocean is a genetically distinct environment and the single most diverse source of new molecules to be discovered
1992047 families lived with hope but are now living with despair
1992048 there is a 50 per cent chance of getting treatment it is a roll of the dice
1992049 the stats show ibi treatment is most effective when started before the age of five branden is going to be five in december
1992050 he actually looked at me and said i love you
1992051 that has never happened before so it is very important and i am worried with the cutbacks they already have theyre going to take it away
1992052 2010 is 18 months from now what weve seen is that in a number of countries theyve already reached their universal access targets others not
1992053 when we look at global targets none of us believes that it will be 100 everywhere
1992054 but if you look at individual countries and if you look at the percent that have achieved universal coverage or will be close to universal coverage there may be much more than you think of
1992055 this is another brick in the wall in the sense that there is mountingevidence primarily from observational studies that there is at least somebenefit for prevention of dementia
1992056 why would the epidemiological studies show one thing while the clinical trials show another
1992057 you cant show benefit in a year if you already have it alzheimers disease
1992058 unfortunately i dont think the data are strong enough to reach a conclusion
1992059 the trigger threshold for taking a statin should be low because they are generally helpful medications
1992060 a restraint of trade to benefit the artificial sweetener industry
1992061 i did not kill my husband but he drank at least 10 diet sodas per day in which metabloizes into ethynol
1992062 the safest setting for labor delivery and the immediate post partum period is in the hospital
1992063 tpa has been demonstrated to reduce disability from ischemic clot caused stroke however the drug is only currently approved for use within three hours of symptom onset
1992064 it is important for people to recognize the symptoms of stroke and promptly call 9 1 1 emergency medical services when they occur
1992065 although patients arriving at the hospital within two hours of symptom onset were significantly more likely to receive a timely ct scan than those who did not 24 percent vs 9 percent most 76 percent did not
1992066 this points to areas where stroke systems of care can be improved in hospitals improvements could increase patients access to time dependent therapies and potentially reduce disability from stroke
1992067 the individual failed to turn up for work on a number of occasions and there was no option but to let him go
1992068 this should not be a case of taking revenge but to reform and to make her understand such racial sentiments were not acceptable
1992069 if she repeats it then more severe action will be taken against her we will watch her closely and may even place another teacher to sit in the class with her
1992070 moving her elsewhere is even worse as she can start the verbal abuse all over again in a different environment she needs to undergo counselling to control her emotions if she is unable to control her emotions how can she teach
1992071 this is the first step in the development of an electric field refrigeration unit
1992072 for the future we can envision a flat panel refrigerator no more coils no more compressors just solid polymer with appropriate heat exchangers
1992073 these polymers are flexible and can be used for heating and cooling so there may be many different possible applications
1992074 it seems to be a deliberate improper use of the emblem
1992075 its the difference between wearing jammies to bed and wearing your work clothes to bed
1992076 unbifurcated garments are far more comfortable and suitable to male anatomy than trousers or shorts because they dont confine the legs or cramp the male genitals the way that trousers or shorts do
1992077 please open your hearts and inseams for an option in mail carrier comfort
1992078 i got so pumped up after being at such a low that im taking this to the next convention in 2010 in anaheim calif
1992079 people who have fought the civil rights battle economically politically legally as we have since the 50s would often talk about look what would happen if we have an african american president or chairmens or chairpersons of major congressional committees it doesnt look like its going to be what we all thought it was going to be
1992080 there would be a real crackdown on economic exploitation in the ghettos and poor rural areas the poor pay more they die more earlier healthcare et cetera and african americans with seniority or in positions of power we thought would really pay attention to that
1992081 as obama began speaking at baldwin wallace college an unidentified photographer on the press riser heckled him and then began reciting the pledge of allegiance before many in the audience of 2 700 shouted him down
1992082 if you want to recite the pledge of allegiance go ahead
1992083 they could just look at the business checking account and see the growth trends
1992084 thats going to make it a little more difficult for entrepreneurs to get the capital they need
1992085 its a tool to be able to give your customer access to capital under extended terms that fit their business model
1992086 you would think in a time of economic downturn that a loan program like the sbas which is specifically designed for borrowers whose loans cant be underwritten in the conventional sense would be expanding
1992087 quite the contrary is actually happening in the market now
1992088 were hearing lenders say thats the straw thats breaking the camels done
1992089 lower demand for capital and a tightening of credit standards by some lenders
1992090 yes there is tightness in the overall credit market and a slowdown of the macroeconomy
1992091 but if you have a good business plan and youve already been working with your community bank theres money to be had
1992092 for the first time weve used rnai to dramatically suppress hiv infection in an organism
1992093 both prophylactic and therapeutic regimens proved successful apparently the sirnas kept hiv from entering most t cells and kept it from replicating when it managed to slip inside
1992094 im not saying weve developed tomorrows therapy but this is a major step forward weve used a small animal model for hiv and proven that rnai works in that model
1992095 led to huge changes in british society and changes which i think we are still living with now
1992096 you know theyve reintroduced the death penalty for insurance company directors
1992097 well in fairness what else is scarlett johnassen for but to be ogled
1992098 wouldnt you want to her too if you were me
1992099 gas disks to gas giants simulating the birth of planetary systems
1992100 but we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
1992101 the shapes of the exoplanets orbits are elongated not nice and circular planets are not where we expect them to be many giant planets similar to jupiter known as hot jupiters are so close to the star they have orbits of mere days clearly we needed to start fresh in explaining planetary formation and this greater variety of planets we now see
1992102 such a turbulent history would seem to leave little room for the sedate solar system and our simulations show exactly that
1992103 conditions must be just right for the solar system to emerge
1992104 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
1992105 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
1992106 the solar system had to be born under just the right conditions to become this quiet place we see the vast majority of other planetary systems didnt have these special properties at birth and became something very different
1992107 teaching a large first year course at a british university i am fed up with correcting my students atrocious spelling
1992108 caps we cant go above if you sing this in public and people drop c notes keep them but drop an e note to bjmitchel att net
1992109 the legal profession isnt going through the best of times
1992110 lawyers are one of the only more or less independent groups left in russia though bureaucrats have tried to change that in order to curry favor
1992111 a normal person and people are always weak what would he do he needs to feed his family he needs to live so he gives up
1992112 the only thing that may allow me to reenter would be the reestablishment of the rule of law
1992113 i am sure that the top 1 percent would like to see all complaining stop how else are they going to get away with stealing a decades worth of economic opportunity from the middle class
1992114 this is childs play eat your food because someone in this world is starving i am looking for something more meaningful each time i visit this childlike school of thought i become angry complacency comes to mind we as a culture have let the ball roll in a direction that has been a detriment to ourselves when will we stop listening to simplistic ideas that do nothing but gloss over and allow it to go on
1992115 people certainly can decide to be happy but not by lying to themselves about reality
1992116 i guess you could always tell your family the bright side of no job no food and no transportation jeesh the privileged talking down to the suffering nice
1992117 daily show senior foreign correspondent rob riggle will provide in depth coverage as the world gathers in china earths only remaining superpower
1992118 local authorities are now using foreclosed homes as a prostitution ploy in the central valley
1992119 police say using a foreclosed home to set up a prostitution bust is nothing new but they dont usually talk about it for fear of giving away their strategy cbs13 went to one neighborhood where its happening and some people are not happy about it
1992120 i wouldnt want that around my neighborhood i mean thats not good for my kids
1992121 donnish foreign affairs spokesman and a former lecturer at sandhurst
1992122 so they might better understand the issues that matter to children
1992123 these children werent trying to impress anyone make political capital or headlines
1992124 it shows a time when politics and social change captured the imagination and threw up heroic individuals unlike the bland passionless politics of today
1992125 is a wonderfully written polemic in which james outlines the central role that humans can play in shaping their individual and collective destiny the speed with which politics can overtake the most under developed and politically acquiescent society transforming individual lives in the common pursuit of freedom
1992126 even if obama wins the new conservative government here will probably face similar dilemmas in terms of supporting us international actions that blair faced therefore know your friend who may actually be your worst enemy
1992127 i think they should all read jonathan roses the intellectual history of the british working classes that really explains how social mobility was created in this country by a magnificent idea giving everyone equal access to education great music art and above all great books in public libraries nobody seems to believe in any of that any more tell them i said so
1992128 for whom the bell tolls and it will be unless politicians can come back from their summer hols with at least one true sentence
1992129 nudge the book that has politicos on either side of the atlantic agog with the idea that people can be gently manoeuvred into doing the right thing
1992130 this bus is an assault vehicle in the fight against global warming be a green patriot
1992131 for a lot of guys its the women in their lives who manage their healthcare
1992132 oldham have used their favourable geographic circumstance to sign the versatile kieran lee from manchester united
1992133 its obviously an embarrassment and we would rather not be in this position
1992134 he will be catapulted into a whole different area in life hes going to go among the best of us
1992135 hes going to be a well known celebrity now everyone is going to know who he is and the little leisure things that he could do sometimes he probably cant do the spotlight is much bigger on him
1992136 thats funny because reality for us is we never focus on any individual
1992137 the one sometimes isnt so what we try to do is focus on the race itself and beating seven people as we continue to focus that way we dont single out any one particular person or any particular country or anything like that
1992138 because at the olympic games youre going to hear of people youve never heard of run very fast we dont want to set our sights on one thing and be upset by somebody else
1992139 hes a great talent and hes just coming into his own
1992140 hes upholding the tradition of usa track and field tyson is doing our sport well and if anybody had broken my american record im glad its him
1992141 ill be honest with you its going to be very hard for him for the simple fact that hes not going to have any races before the olympics
1992142 you might be healthy but its a psychological thing with yourself you really dont know if your leg will uphold to the pressure that youre going to put on it when youre going at those top end speeds because theres no way to simulate that in practice you put pressure on it yeah but youve got to get over that psychological barrier
1992143 he can come back strong one good thing is that you dont become the american record holder be in that kind of shape and lose it all in a week and a half
1992144 if he does the right thing he can take full recovery the training base is already laid
1992145 a matter of sharpness and hell have those three rounds to work on that
1992146 its awe inspiring to coach gay i feel lucky i feel blessed i feel privileged
1992147 and a lot of excitement because one this young man trusts me i dont take it for granted i wont abuse it
1992148 its funny the start has definitely made a 180 from the first year when we started working together until the end of that season and it has improved again from last year
1992149 but ultimately the fact that i was able to pinpoint a lot of other mechanical issues that he had which helped improve his overall performance i think thats been the key
1992150 i have a theory that if its not broke you upgrade
1992151 if it aint broke dont fix it the reality is in this computer technological age computers are not broken but you do need to upgrade software i kind of look and view what weve been doing together the same way every year were going to have to upgrade
1992152 theres no perfect race but i do believe that you can perfect each race you run given that we can execute the things that we need to execute at the time we need to do it
1992153 im hoping that given the time we have the rest and recovery technically hell be solid
1992154 keep your confidence man and just do what youve been doing dont try to do anything extra thats when you get into a problem
1992155 as long as you derive inner help and comfort from anything you should keep it if you were to give it up in a mood of self sacrifice or out of a stern sense of duty you would continue to want it back and that unsatisfied want would make trouble for you only give up a thing when you want some other condition so much that the thing no longer has any attraction for you
1992156 it became a chicken or egg problem if cooperation between t and b cells is needed to create an autoimmune disease who falls off the fence first and why shlomchik said
1992157 when i get cross with independent producers i just have to show them my two fingers and i have a perfect v sign
1992158 on july 29 we reached a hotel in new york and soon after checking in a hotel paramjit said he wanted to make a call to his mother and came down however after sometime he called up the teacher to inform that he was going with his uncle to bring something for his mother the teacher asked him to return immediately but his uncle assured that he would return the next morning
1992159 no brain at all some of them only grey fluff thats blown into their heads by mistake
1992160 when you actually have a fire when you actually need the bloody thing it blows your head off
1992161 the aussies will be laughing their socks off if he is still in the team next year
1992162 forming grammatically correct sentences is for the normal individual the prerequisite for any submission to social laws no one is supposed to be ignorant of grammaticality those who are belong in special institutions the unity of language is fundamentally political there is no mother tongue only a power takeover by a dominant language
1992163 lot of little things like the example above and such things as confusing their there and theyre
1992164 grazman believes the degenerating use of the englishh language will have a detrimental effect upon the standard of the written language in the future
1992165 2 the english cricket press and fans are a lot less sensationalist and far more sensible than their football counterparts given some of the jingoistic tripe which is spouted at football world cups its difficult to support england if you are not obliged to by birth
1992166 she said im not sorry because i always do what i did to annoy her
1992167 well id make the necessary sacrifices but big businesses wont
1992168 well wed do whats necessary but then our customers wouldnt buy our more expensive product
1992169 palestinian sources have accused israel of trying to assassinate jihad jaara one of the palestinians sent to exile following the siege on the church of the nativity in 2002 who now resides in ireland according to the sources jaara escaped an assassination attempt and the irish police arrested two suspects a palestinian from gaza who has a european citizenship and a moroccan with a french citizenship
1992170 ill add some genes from a mime so they will shut up all the time
1992171 all this talk about an agreement that has supposed to have been reached which is being reported is utter nonsense
1992172 would decide whether zanu pf and the main opposition movement for democratic change mdc would come up with a final power sharing deal this weekend
1992173 all this talk about an agreement that has supposed to have been reached which is being reported is utter nonsense
1992174 coltrane was almost savage in attempting to play his horn as thoroughly as he could
1992175 so parents and teachers need to revise their thoughts about this
1992176 because if your mom or your teacher thinks you cant do math that can have a big impact on your math self concept
1992177 boys did a teeny bit better in some states and girls did a teeny bit better in others
1992178 but when you average them all you essentially get no difference
1992179 but we need to motivate teachers to do so by including those items on the tests
1992180 so youre dipping farther down into the distribution of female talent which brings down the average score
1992181 that may be the explanation for the results rather than girls arent as good as math
1992182 but as a scientist i have to challenge them with data
1992183 users still had this constant panic that somethings going to be missed
1992184 were not offering free storage and hoping to one day make it up in ad revenue
1992185 she wanted to have a baby i cant believe i got sent to prison for something like that
1992186 all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights
1992187 everyone has the right to life liberty and security of person
1992188 no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
1992189 surely we can all agree people of different faiths and no faith at all that
1992190 god does not accept the good deeds of anyone unless they have faith
1992191 when rights overrule duties you end up in situations where guantanamo becomes a normality
1992192 fanatics are picturesque mankind would rather see gestures than listen to reason
1992193 relieve the burden on families struggling with high gas and grocery bills or preparing for high heating bills
1992194 anyone who doesnt expect fernando torres and robbie keane to strike up a joyously fruitful partnership is a begrudger or a fool
1992195 the full backs wont compensate alvaro arbeloa is a tidy defender but hes no raider in the style of bacary sagna jose bosingwa or even wes brown philippe degen as you might expect from a freebie is not up to their class either though he would offer more going forward than arbeloa does albeit at the cost of slack defending on the left dossena is an improvement on jon arne riise but again inferior to patrice evra ga l clichy and ashley cole
1992196 so why not take the 18m for barry and get a quality right winger it seems so simple
1992197 whats stevie g hate that by the way going to do
1992198 whenever a game isnt going liverpools way there is always the question
1992199 central midfielders barry left mascherano sitting alonso lucas advanced and gerrard on the right he can play alongside gerrard in an advanced roll ahead of mascherano in a 3 man midfield and he can play a defensive roll in a 2 man midfield as hes more disciplined than gerrard he can also play left back and left wing back if need be we were 11 points of top last year having lost fewer games than the eventual champions if we can convert some of those draws to wins and stay in the contest until march ill e happy august 8 2008 9 26 am manchester gbr i had trouble staying awake reading that all i was waiting for was for the phrase with the full backs tucking in to pop up just to confirm my suspicions that the mysteriously unphotographable paul doyle is really david pleat putting on a paddy accent i believe that liverpools most significant recruit during the summer months has been completely overlooked by whoever it was who wrote this this time last season rafa was about to part company under ugly and accrimonious circumstances with his right hand man of eleven years paco ayesteran despite starting stronger than any of the other big four teams last term liverpool immediately started to draw too many games most notablly at home as the effect of the split took its toll on team morale paco was the man manager of the team and rumours from inside melwood that rafa would have resigned by the start of this season due to the nature of the bust up between himself and ayesteran began to circulate the city twelve months later and rafa is still in charge but with the much loved an respected sammy lee now part of the set up as his assistant manager despite being offered a position by the incoming manager sammy lee bade liverpool a very emotional farewell on the day that rafa started work there in 2004 now if hicks and gillett decide to throw the club into turmoil and destroy team morale by some new hitherto inconceivable act of complete stupidity then they will have a much harder task in rocking the boat agree with you for the most part paul i think most liverpool fans are scratching their heads about our incessant pursuit of the barry we have lacked decent width particularly on the right for years now and at the minute we have about 10m that could be invested in a half decent wide player it simply beggars belief that madrid can sign the likes of van der vaart for that amount and yet were apparently haggling with espanyol over the likes of flippin alberto riera and whilst im aware that if one were to take pre season games at face value andrei voronin would be the best striker in the league second only to the prolific darren bent but im really enjoying the style of play weve reverted to with neat short passing and through balls the crouch induced style of long ball head tennis whilst effective was painful for many to watch im hoping that we are afforded the luxury of seeing more of nemeth pacheco and plessis during the campaign young skillful players with good attacking instincts and as for the inevitable pool baiting bitter few up and about this morning cheer up folks its a friday the proper footie starts next week save the bitterness for when you head back to school my prediction for the coming season rather than feed the myth that all lfc fans are misguided buffoons annually bleating this is our year i think ill reserve my judgement only to say itll defintely be progress radiskilly whilst spending considerably less money i dont know the figures but he like jol at spurs seems to buy an awful lot of players most of whom reside merseyside for a year at best even if theyre relatively cheaper then throws a big fee or two on top and it probably comes out if not close to what the big two spend then certainly proportionate given the fourth or fifth or third place they seem to always occupy hes bought a fair few more duds that you mentioned there and has so far spent much more than chelsea the last two seasons he spends enough to get better results is all im labouring to say and if a few of the smaller fees were added together i do think hed have a trimmer tighter more effective squad august 8 2008 9 28 am redbridge gbr i didnt notice many exclusively wide players when spain won euro08 august 8 2008 9 29 am glenrothes gbr i have a horrible feeling that keane is going to be placed out wide he was stuck out on the left in the friendly the other night and he looked lost barry is not needed alonso is a far better player what liverpool need is natural wide players babel looks a better prospect when he plays inside and i think he would be better used as a striker benitez should give up on barry sell pennant and voronin and use the cash to buy two decent wingers the only question is which wingers are suitable august 8 2008 9 30 am cambridge gbr heno
1992200 wes brown is one of the worst right backs in the league
1992201 1st 2nd 3rd places interesting but very over discussed topic any thoughts on 4th 5th 6th
1992202 if i walked on water theyll say its because i cannot swim
1992203 looks like a liverpool blog full of joy passion and love with themselves
1992204 gerrard can be very dangerous out there but lacks the discipline or inclination to actually stay there
1992205 overhaul houlliers squad featuring the likes of biscan traore cheyrou diao diouf cisse baros and smicer whilst spending considerably less money than his main rivals and not losing any ground on them
1992206 can a liverpool fan post what they think stating 11 will be once everyone is available post olympics
1992207 19m for roobie keane still sticks out as far too much for a good but not great player who will be 29 in february and if torres is absent from the team for any amount of time i think they may well struggle a bit look out for spuds and liverpool battling it out for 4th next season
1992208 and where is the land of the rising red exactly is it just liverpool i guess so not very inspiring now is it
1992209 your 4 2 3 1 looks an awful lot like 4 2 2 1 1 which is just 4 2 2 still better ideas than rafa
1992210 they cannot compete until they have more than one leader in the team stevie g is not enough
1992211 i am the only who finds it strange that garreth barry won nothing is worth more than xabi alonso champion of europe for club and country
1992212 although i hate to say it 3rd or 4th again is about right and although its been said before each of the past few seasons if liverpool are not properly challenging for the title this year then rafa should do the honorable thing no excuses
1992213 my other thought is that the whole barry saga is just an attempt to unsettle the team most likely to nick liverpools 4th place spot
1992214 they buy players to ensure they are the 4th best team in the league hence crouch pennant bellamy keane
1992215 dont worry lads rvn henry will get us out of trouble so we dont have to try as hard
1992216 another 4th or even 3rd finish this season and will rafas lack of progress in challenging for the title be brought into serious question
1992217 this is benitezs fifth year of his five year plan so i reckon hell win the league theres no real reasoning behind this its just a feeling if he doesnt win the league or at least mount a decent challenge hell probably leave henos right about gerrard though shouldve left after the champions league win theyd never get enough to justify his sale now as for andy gray his ridiculous reaction to gerrards substitution against everton last season and liverpools vast improvement thereafter still makes me smile hates liverpool loves gerrard
1992218 four plus four in uefa competitions such as the champions league and uefa cup
1992219 what would it take for liverpool fans to finally admit that benitez isnt going to land them the premier league title spend 20m on babel and kuyt or spend 20m on someone like arshavin who would you choose out of the two choices spend 37m on keane kuyt and crouch or spend 30 odd million on david villa lucas leiva benayoun babel pennant bellamy gonzalez for 40m or berbatov and deco for less than that
1992220 in other words with a smaller budget although still better than arsenals or most other sides liverpool have been slowly catching up with two of the strongest and wealthiest club sides in the world whilst maintaining an excellent record in europe and this is considered failure
1992221 care to tell me what you really found so riseable about my post
1992222 maybe i have missed something but how exactly have liverpool been catching up
1992223 raf doesnt seem up to speed about what it needs to win a title
1992224 maybe i have missed something but how exactly have liverpool been catching up
1992225 note how rio destroyed torres in both games last year cutting space not letting through balls get to him leaving little or no room for him to manoeuvre
1992226 the top 4 spend vastly more on players than any of the rest even arsenal despite the medias incorrect perception that wenger always unearths bargains
1992227 albeit because of obscene refereeing when chelsea came to anfield
1992228 gerrard can be very dangerous out there but lacks the discipline or inclination to actually stay there
1992229 liverpool are the most negative destructive and dreary side to watch out of the top 4 closely followed by chelsea and id quite happily not watch a single one of their matches this season
1992230 wouldnt ben tez be better off buying at least one top class wide man particularly for the right
1992231 gareth barry plays for aston villa but theres no telling what he would be capable of if he were playing for a much better side such as liverpool
1992232 pateau interesting facts can you let me know where you got them also is there any info out there on the reported wage bills for the same period cheers
1992233 everybody can see that the team and squad is improving every year and that now we are much better but will that be enough to win the title thats the big question because it depends on the other teams as well
1992234 the key is not to say that we can win the title
1992235 liverpool lost key ground in the middle third of last season when he rested torres
1992236 the trouble for us is breaking down the small teams at anfield and on the road thats all i got going back to bed
1992237 rather than one who runs around a lot week in week out but produces 90 seconds of magic every few months
1992238 although the number of hiv diagnoses among men in this group decreased the last two decades recent data shows these rates are on the rise again making it critical that we continue to understand this group in order to guide prevention and education efforts
1992239 when one drinks or uses other substances inhibitions are lowered making people more likely to engage in risky behavior like unprotected sex this is particularly true for young people who often take risks without thinking about the consequences some patients who are newly diagnosed might be in denial which could lead to poor decisions when it comes to sex
1992240 unfortunately such behaviors put the partners of these men at great risk for contracting hiv and unknowingly transmitting it to others
1992241 which hiv infected men who have sex with men msm in care are most likely to transmit hiv to others
1992242 the three dear ones who have been presented to you are three devout people loyal towards the revolution and have a long record of serving the revolution what resemblance is there between mr behbahani with the ministers of the time of the revolt against god the shahs era the honorable hosseini is the result of the revolution and has therefore been appointed and the honorable kordan has sacrificed thirty years of his life serving the revolution in very important responsibilities
1992243 yesterday my dear brother dr ahmadinejad the honorable president for whom i have great respect made a reference to a sentence allegedly said by the supreme leader of the revolution regarding cabinet ministers this author has exact knowledge of the affair and i know and i do not doubt the least that unfortunately this reference is false and unreal and is contrary to the opinion of the supreme leader of the revolution the difference is close to negation if mr ahmadinejad excuses me it must be said that in his speech yesterday the real opinion of the lord khamenei was forged to leave the impression that the supreme leader of the revolution not only totally agrees with the minister suggested by mr ahmadinejad but has even encouraged members of the parliament to give them a vote of confidence it is no surprise that the honorable members of the parliament who consider themselves students of the supreme leader and obey him regardless of their opinion have given a vote of confidence to the ministers there are two exceptions those who were aware of the true words of the lord and second those parliamentarians who are aware of the general opinion and deeds of the supreme leader of the revolution and naturally but also wisely have deemed the reference false

1992250 there was a slight safety risk for women wearing normal bras with metal parts underneath a bullet proof vest

1992256 barry silbert ceo of rsp has done a phenomenal job since the credit crisis began in the winter i recognized for a period of time what he was doing and the incredible potential he had here
1992257 when the opportunity came up to join the company i jumped at it
1992258 i will be in the auction world i will focus on the dealer community at large the issuer community specifically the student loan issuers the municipalities and the closed end funds

1992260 i want to try to create liquidity in a market where there has traditionally been little or none

1992266 unfortunately the capital market treats the hotel industry very reciprocally and it seems like our run of good fortune has come to a halt and that itll probably be a while before we see a new project funded and moving forward again
1992267 dont despair dont throw in the towel the signs are very good for a nice spread of dry weather from now on im very confident of that
1992268 but when they are heading back up into the hills and out into the open spaces they know the good weather is coming
1992269 stand up straight throw your shoulders back and have lots of sex
1992270 it is air conditioned but its not for those who want peace and relaxation if you consider the food quality and reasonable price as a good tradeoff then this place might just be for you
1992271 i wanted a place apart from the main house to read and listen to music
1992272 was to get three colors of equal values so one hue didnt pop out at you it was a challenge
1992273 i wanted to make a man made object evocative of nature
1992274 the looseness of the house the way it feathers away into the landscape comes from my desire to make it part of the outdoors
1992275 one nation under obama wow this would make stalin mao and all the liberal fascists in this country very proud
1992276 because idiots need to find each other in a crowed
1992277 then they do the hokey pokey and thats what its all about
1992278 now put your tongue in and your tongue out tongue in and blblblblbl you do the hokey pokey turn yourself around thats what its all about
1992279 but the quest has resulted in some very practical developments most recently a drug that helps cure a common degenerative eye disease
1992280 wed be talking about a huge increase in costs to a program that is already strained today
1992281 do you need a real estate agent to sell your home
1992282 the home front would like to congratulate greg healy and jay thompson for passionately and intelligently articulating their positions both men demonstrated themselves to be classy and tough competitors
1992283 healy should expect to receive his housing rumble championship belt in the coming weeks after it has been smelted and insured we trust he will accept our invitation to defend his title
1992284 if youre in a rec center with three kids and theres nothing for those kids to do your heads going to explode those are emotional scars that are going to last for years
1992285 is the chance to get into some kind of market first
1992286 you can make mistakes without being put under that to me as an entrepreneur is the biggest draw
1992287 its been an implicit assumption that people come here to stay not to come and go
1992288 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
1992289 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1992290 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
1992291 the republican party is a dead rotting carcass with a few decrepit old leaders stumbling around like zombies in a horror version of weekend with bernie handcuffed to a corpse
1992292 be afraid hate everything that isnt attack mode and vote your fear
1992293 well i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
1992294 either we go on beating ourselves and our students up over this problem or we simply give everyone a break and accept these variant spellings as such
1992295 i think ur degree should all be graded in three ways
1992296 words such as through would make more sense were they simplified to for example something like thru why not whats so terrible about that how did that gh get in on the act anyway
1992297 i went tu tu shops tu i went to buy a tutu
1992298 loot tho would need to be lut as would the instrument
1992299 i am sure that many of the disparaging comments that obssess about spelling are made by english people largely male largely white possibly largely large rather than scottish welsh or of any other ilk
1992300 those who understand only their own generation remain children forever
1992301 in george orwells 1984 people had a simplified language with simplified words the aim simplified people we should fight against this numbing of our language on all fronts
1992302 i tooke a bodkine gh amp put it betwixt my eye amp the bone as neare to the backside of my eye as i could amp pressing my eye with the end of it soe as to make the curvature a bcdef in my eye there appeared severall white darke amp coloured circles r s t amp c which circles were plainest when i continued to rub my eye with the point of the bodkine but if i held my eye amp the bodkin still though i continued to presse my eye with it yet the circles would grow faint amp often disappeare untill i removed them by moving my eye or the bodkin
1992303 and the ability to convey the above in a coherant manner
1992304 the english language is not static but it does have rules nevertheless
1992305 there is a difference between applying newer standards to language and not bothering to apply standards at all
1992306 before the printing press people from neighbouring counties in this country had difficulty communicating those from distant counties were almost entirely unable to do so after typeset was invented we were forced to agree universal conventions in order to avoid having to print the same thing many different ways this was an incredible step forward for everyone
1992307 obviously what he did not do was pay attention to jimmy carters televised speech of july 15 1979 had he done so and used his popularity to urge enactment of the plan we would be independent of imported oil today just like brazil is
1992308 the experiments by our collaborators at the university of california san diego demonstrated that this mechanism is present and our theory explained why and how it happens
1992309 the gap in understanding of single bond and multiple bond breaking processes is just incredible
1992310 declining real estate market values caused by the sub prime lending crisis means that consumers are not being able to borrow against the equity in their homes and are searching for other sources of funding
1992311 there are two kinds of people who go there to borrow money
1992312 there are those who cannot get loans anywhere else and those who hope for a better interest rate than they could get elsewhere
1992313 people tend to be very rational when it comes to lending their own money
1992314 youre one of those men who only give permission to little bits of life to get through to you
1992315 its all about allocating working memory to the things that are most important
1992316 when something grabs our attention we automatically divert some of our working memory to it in case it turns out to be important in other words it gets the lions share of memory resources
1992317 when we look at a scene we dont remember every detail only the broad gist and one or two specific details
1992318 we allocate very small portions of our memory to the background and far more to the important details if you test people you find that they have very little knowledge of the details of what they just saw because their visual memory is so limited
1992319 limited memory puts clear limitations on what we actually see rather than what we think we see seeing involves looking at objects and storing them briefly in our working memory but that memory is incredibly small so what we actually see is extremely restricted our vision is determined not just by what we look at but by our memory of the scene
1992320 when we decide to look at an object we clearly perceive it as being significant and reallocate our memory to it
1992321 so even though we havent looked at it yet we still remember more about it than the object weve just looked at
1992322 part of the reason these patients may not be aware of objects is because they have very severe limitations in their visual working memory capacity
1992323 without memory devoted to some parts of the visual field patients dont see objects there
1992324 lunch was excellent there was more than i could eat so i will save the leftovers for later the curry was drier than i usually like it but the flavor was very good the orange looked very cozy wrapped up in its little comforter all it needed to be perfect was a piece of fresh baked naan
1992325 if you have under 100 000 even the token ira fees and commissions of 15 30 or 50 add up
1992326 the pro for rolling it over into an ira is diversification
1992327 in an ira you can invest in individual stocks bonds and any mutual fund you want to
1992328 someone has limited the choices to a reasonable number and done a screen for you
1992329 if you are satisfied with the investments that you have then you might want to leave your money there
1992330 you can do unlimited direct rollovers on an annual basis
1992331 if theres employer stock inside the 401 k you may want to not roll that portion into an ira

1992339 colbert continued to ask questions while pretending to pump out some gatorade
1992340 im probably the most ardent unionist in the scottish parliament however my political experience for the last 10 years or more is that scots do want a different distinctive scottish voice to shout for them
1992341 the tenor of the response is thank god someone has said it
1992342 he just allows the magazines to make their cover choices independently
1992343 the quantum of solace i dont know what that means

1992345 i met a lovely lady but found out she was a rotter
1992346 for the first time weve built a sequence from ancient dna that is essentially without error
1992347 we also wanted to know about the history of the neandertals themselves
1992348 most argue there were a few thousand neandertals that roamed over europe 40 000 years ago
1992349 its still an open question for the future whether this small group of neandertals was a general feature or was this caused by some bottleneck in their population size that happened late in the game
1992350 using a delivery method for t cells we now show that sirna treatment can dramatically suppress hiv infection this is nice proof of principle that it could be used as a therapeutic strategy we think it has real promise but there is a lot more to be done
1992351 no one had demonstrated before that hiv infection can be stopped in vivo not just in cell lines but in animal models it implies it might work in humans
1992352 the challenge is delivery to the right cell within a living animal
1992353 how do you get it in especially into t cell where hiv infects its a big challenge
1992354 when treated with the sirna mix the infected mice looked almost like uninfected controls
1992355 they had negligible levels of virus and their cd4 counts were maintained
1992356 the availability of a preclinical animal model for hiv infection as shown in this study should allow rapid testing of these strategies as well as other potential problems such as viral escape and toxicity that have to be resolved before rnai therapy can be translated for clinical use
1992357 other susceptibility genes for cs and cs like phenotypes must exist
1992358 we hypothesized that sdhx might represent susceptibility genes other than pten for cs cs like syndromes
1992359 our data have important implications for both patient care and genetic counseling i would like to see others independently repeat our observations nonetheless clinicians should consider sdh testing for pten mutation negative cs cs like individuals especially if these individuals have a strong personal history and or family history of breast thyroid or kidney cancer in fact patients with sdhx mutation should be more rigorously screened for these cancers compared to those with pten mutations
1992360 if the timing is off the brain wont set up its circuits properly
1992361 the eyes are ready and seeing properly you can rewire now
1992362 the eye is telling the brain when to become plastic rather than the brain developing on its own clock
1992363 the idea that this class of molecular messenger is passed from cell to cell is considered unorthodox in cell biology
1992364 early excitatory input is important to make first contacts between neurons
1992365 the nervous system is recycling an embryonic factor to induce brain plasticity
1992366 vendors not unreasonably want to make the most money they can and think that only in richer neighborhoods can they do that
1992367 he should set up shop in clinton hill where he is needed and where the residents wouldnt mind that he is an immigrant trying to make a dollar like the rest of us
1992368 this court can conceive no other sanction that would avoid substantial unfairness to bright moreover the spoliation inference is particularly appropriate in order to deter similar conduct by plaza and other businesses in the future

1992375 perhaps the most memorable in southern california since 1982 when the scores of more than a dozen students in jaime escalantes ap calculus class at garfield high school were invalidated because of suspected cheating the students retook the exams and passed and the events were later turned into the film stand and deliver
1992376 the educational testing service ets has tried to defend cancelling 690 advanced placement test scores for about 380 trabuco high students by referring to its student parent bulletin
1992377 acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
1992378 nothing of a substantial nature or a dramatic nature that is new
1992379 in this most critical speech of his presidency he delivered his text more effectively than he has ever done before
1992380 signs of a new political acuity and a new personal discipline
1992381 if you miss a loan payment you hurt your credit rating if you miss a payment on a 401 k loan it is considered to be in default
1992382 under many plans a defaulted loan is considered a taxable distribution and it will immediately trigger an income tax on the total amount of the loan
1992383 while this might mean that some employees would not contribute quite as much to their 401 k plans it would also mean that what they did contribute would be there for retirement
1992384 sorry we have nearly no budget for the record can you work for half quarter of your usual rate or can you do it for nothing
1992385 killerjoe like i said smileys or no you dont get to decide who likes what

1992389 la argentina es el pa s del mundo que m s trofeos gan en el nivel internacional
1992390 argentina is the country that has won the most trophies on the international level
1992391 behind it all of course is the old question of money the olympics rely heavily on the football tournament to make it for them even more than the drug ridden athletics even at the los angeles games when pro soccer had such a shaky foothold in the usa attendances at matches were vast
1992392 riquelme finds messi who finds the goal football can be pretty simple eh
1992393 la argentina es el pa s del mundo que m s trofeos gan en gt el nivel internacional
1992394 argentina have nothing to fear from brazil as the mighty olywhites yes that is the incredibly stupid name given to the nz soccer team at the olympics why oh why do we insist on giving our national teams stupid names all blacks is fine but can we please stop there will be taking them down in their next game

1992460 obamas plan pays for all proposals and cuts the deficit from its 2008 level and relative to what would happen if current policies were continued he would like to balance the budget but with the tremendous economic and global uncertainty cannot make a specific promise about when that will happen

1992475 we need additional revenues and weve got to get creative without raising taxes
1992476 i dont believe the governor would put public servants in the crossfire of this budget battle
1992477 but this action would speak to the need for all us including the governor to negotiate a balanced responsible budget that protects our schools and the safety net before we run out of cash
1992478 republicans understand the urgency of getting the budget done as soon as possible which is our main focus right now

1992517 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
1992518 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
1992519 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
1992520 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
1992521 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly

1992528 this is a testament to the fact that firms have produced strong productivity gains estimated to have risen at a 2 5 pace in 1h08
1992529 this is related to the decline in the dollar and the composition of us exports which is concentrated in agricultural products industrial supplies and capital equipment items that remain in demand by rapidly growing emerging market economies
1992530 it should be noted that only twice in the last three decades at the end of 2001 and 1982 did firms destock at the pace seen in 1h08

1992532 if they tie education to the economy and diplomacy something not too hard to do it could make education a big deal
1992533 i believe that every child deserves an education which helps them reach their full potential
1992534 americas current public education system is failing to give our students the skills they need to succeed in todays global economy as a mother i know nothing is more important then ensuring our children have a solid foundation for their success later in life this foundation includes strong schools and a world class education to help them succeed i urge our nations leaders to make education reform a priority
1992535 our new ad campaign coupled with our presence in states including iowa missouri and ohio gives americans the opportunity to talk about education and urge the leaders of this country to work with parents teachers activists and community leaders to create real change in the way we educate our kids
1992536 while it may be possible to fully perform within the scientific networks that float in the inaccessible atmosphere of scientific objectivity one possible zone for intervention and re reading by artists and activists is the space between system based biology and the networks that clone capitalism is now interlocking into the old e capitalism database sharing tools in order to create new speculation bubbles

1992582 i recall with nostalgia the days of harry truman and dwight eisenhower and john kennedy when a bipartisan foreign policy served so well in the cold war
1992583 republicans backed the truman doctrine the marshall plan nato and the korean war
1992584 felt the job he was about to undertake was so important that he was ready to renounce the possibility of his becoming president in order to make nato a success
1992585 to return to the states to enter the republican primaries to keep bob taft from becoming president and ruining nato

1992596 my concern is that the county system with its lack of time between matches for players to reflect on their mistakes and prepare for the next game does not encourage players to think for themselves
1992597 the worst thing for michael vaughan to have done would have been to hang on to the end of this series because that would have made the first test in india later this year a tricky captaincy debut for pietersen
1992598 our engineers didnt like that it was the simple flashlight that was so popular

1992607 oh thats right exclude exports its not like the ability to sell your wares to the rest of the planet is important
1992608 if american goods are cheaper now since our dollar is worth less and falling when compared to the euro and other world currencies doesnt this mean we are selling more exports at a loss isnt selling at a profit important

1992677 people who leave the federal service are welcome to leave their retirement funds with us and we actually encourage them to do so because the tsp has one very big advantage over virtually all private sector plans and that is a tremendously attractive fee structure

1992679 fidelitys rollover ira offers investors extensive investment flexibility with no additional account fee the extra convenience of aggregating retirement assets and financial guidance services

1992681 i applaud decision to pull the ads and am disappointed that fidelity has not chosen to follow suit
1992682 the tsp has the lowest administrative costs of any retirement program in the country and i think these misleading ads are a disservice to hard working public servants
1992683 the cost of credit and the availability of credit are the key to housing prices

1992707 we say it is reasonable to add an ecg but it is not mandatory
1992708 if youre a pediatric cardiologist and youre seeing patients with adhd it would seem very reasonable to include an electrocardiogram to look for unsuspected abnormalities

1992725 if the proposals espoused by candidate obama ever became law the american economy would suffer a serious setback
1992726 this would almost surely mark the onset of a recession
1992727 in an effort to resuscitate demand the fed immediately cuts the federal funds rate bringing it 2 percentage points below the status quo level over the next year and one half despite this output growth remains well below trend over that period putting downward pressure on inflation as slack in the economy increases
1992728 tax increases appear to have a very large sustained and highly significant negative impact on output and that tax cuts have very large and persistent positive output effects
1992729 creating jobs is at the center of almost every one of barack obamas economic policies his energy plan would help to create up to 5 million green jobs through investments designed to help make sure that the next set of green industries that we know are coming happen right here in the united states

1992758 this is a good day for the tigers the zoo and the people of iraq
1992759 our heart goes out to the two tigers who had to endure the long trip to iraq and a dangerous future at the baghdad zoo
1992760 these tigers will be caged helpless and completely dependent on humans to survive in an area where many people live in fear and are still without access to basic necessities
1992761 we have the utmost concern for the well being of the tigers
1992762 we have full confidence that the baghdad zoo has the staff and facilities to care for them long into the future
1992763 last year it was a very bad situation in baghdad but now it is good
1992764 still there are bombings but we must adapt to this

1992766 i have said on a number of occasions that we are looking at all the options and stamp duty is one of them but ive also always said that stamp duty and removing it in itself may not kick start the market in the way that people think it might
1992767 we know for example that deposits have gone up because the old mortgages have gone and now lenders are asking for bigger deposits
1992768 stamp duty for the people who pay it and many people who dont represents a small amount of the upfront costs so we have to look at all these issues to make sure we get it right
1992769 its a really tough time what we have done is put 10m behind more debt advice for people weve now got a situation where 90 per cent of our county courts now have free legal advice and we know that if people get the right advice something like 85 per cent of repossessions can be avoided
1992770 but we are also looking at more ways in which we can help people facing difficulties thats why im looking at a mortgage rescue scheme which i announced a few weeks ago but also we are looking at a range of options across government working with treasury to see what we can do
1992771 with the positive recommendations to both cme group and nymex shareholders by iss and egan jones we have obtained further independent endorsement for this transaction

1992779 i must be one heck of a writer to have produced a pornographic book without any sex scenes my book is as realistic a portrayal as i could muster of the prophet mohammeds harem and his domestic life of course it has sexuality but there is no sex in my book
1992780 it was my hope that my book would be a bridge builder develop empathy for this other culture that we know so little about in this country
1992781 it has always rankled me the way history focuses on men and wars and mens politics and leaves women out i wanted to honour the women in mohammeds life by giving them a voice
1992782 married at nine to the much older muhammad aisha uses her wits her courage and her sword to defend her first wife status even as muhammad marries again and again taking twelve wives and concubines in all
1992783 i do have a problem with the deliberate misinterpretation of history you cant play with a sacred history and turn it into soft core pornography
1992784 denise says it is a declaration of war explosive stuff a national security issue
1992785 think it will be far more controversial than the satanic verses and the danish cartoons
1992786 it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
1992787 we felt an obligation to take these concerns very seriously

1992791 its about india what can we do as a country what can we achieve
1992792 what do i care for pakistan we should all leave each other alone
1992793 we know the promise is weak but there is relatively little india can do short of military action and we do not have the stomach for that

1992800 it is not clear why olmert is making this gesture these kinds of steps should be taken with careful consideration and it is questionable how careful a premier who has decided to leave is likely to be
1992801 releasing prisoners satisfies american pressures to make abbas look good
1992802 the objective according to the israeli news is a gesture to abbas however this gesture could actually harm abbas if it is a token gesture
1992803 if it is only three or four criminal prisoners then maybe it is not worth it but if it concerns political prisoners that are important to fatah then it might be meaningful
1992804 there may be some palestinian quid pro quo but it is very hard to imagine what that might be
1992805 if the group to be released includes some hamas members why would abbas want that
1992806 the palestinians who captured shalit are different from the group who submitted these names to olmert

1992809 i work with young children and they respond very well to dialogue
1992810 stephen law writes for youngsters on philosophy in dialogue form
1992811 ive had trouble with students who simply turn their essays into dialogues with one character per paragraph
1992812 i require my students to refer to the text they can have the characters be students talking about a text
1992813 i have my student write in faq format and then have them turn the faq into an essay
1992814 i hear students own voice better in dialogues than essays
1992815 do they pick characters from the reading and have those be characters
1992816 this is a great way to teach sympathy for different viewpoints
1992817 i used to have them write dialogues as preparation to writing essays but now i drop the last step of turning it into essay form
1992818 dialectic vs heuristic dialogue colabrative vs combative in the ancient tradition
1992819 ich konnte dem bundestrainer keine garantie mehr geben dass ich ber das eine jahr hinaus f r das ich beim vfb stuttgart einen vertrag habe noch fu ball spielen werde
1992820 insofern habe ich ihm und andreas k pke vorgeschlagen dass sie f r die deutsche nationalmannschaft nicht mehr mit mir planen
1992821 wir haben in der beurteilung der situation absolut auf einer wellenl nge gelegen ich habe mich bei jens f r gro artige leistungen in der nationalmannschaft bedankt

1992824 it is clear that our health care system isnt giving americans the health care they need and deserve
1992825 the disorganization and inefficiency are affecting americans in their everyday lives and its obvious that people are looking for reform with the upcoming election there is great opportunity for our leaders to hear what the american people are saying they want from a health care system and to respond with meaningful proposals
1992826 there is no one policy or practice that will make our health care system run like an efficient well oiled machine
1992827 this is going to take strong national leadership and a commitment from all of the players in our health care system but with that and the strategies outlined in this report real progress could be made
1992828 im trying to help instill a sense of ownership and attention to detail which will help these soldiers in iraq
1992829 morale is a big thing if you can make a soldier proud here when we go to iraq theyll continue to take pride in their area and in their unit
1992830 its really nice and shows a lot of talent it also shows us that he cares about the unit and the soldiers which is important to us
1992831 if soldiers have a nice area to wind down it helps them to do their job better
1992832 to get a good product you have to pay attention to detail
1992833 whether its soldiers or pieces of wood you can work with them mold them and put them together
1992834 a lot of pride goes into his work both with woodworking and soldiering he does great work because he cares for what he does and he cares for his soldiers
1992835 i went to buy a frame and saw the cost and decided i could make one i bought a router and a saw and made my first frame

1992837 if i see something that needs improvement and i have the means ill fix it its in me i always have to improve things
1992838 for over two centuries of growth and struggle peace and war the constitution has secured our freedom through the guarantee that in the united states no one will be deprived of liberty without due process of law
1992839 without acknowledgement of the protection afforded by the constitution solely because the executive believes that his indefinite military detention or even the indefinite military detention of a similarly situated american citizen is proper
1992840 any person is punishable as a principal under this chapter who commits an offense punishable by this chapter or aids abets counsels commands or procures its commission
1992841 any person subject to this chapter who in breach of an allegiance or duty to the united states knowingly and intentionally aids an enemy of the united states shall be punished as a military commission may direct
1992842 unlike senator obama who voted against the mca and favors giving al qaeda terrorists direct access to u s civilian courts to contest their detention i recognize that we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals
1992843 it is not only the sales of one way fares that have increased but tickets for people making exploratory visits to australia
1992844 this is a very complex issue and im not sure that i have heard any answer that is satisfactory thus far
1992845 i can well understand that where we are at the present time is far from satisfactory for people from england perhaps less from a northern ireland point of view and more from scotland point of view
1992846 the answer is not in english only votes and i think that a lot more thought has to go into it or else we will damage the union and i dont think that is either what the conservative party or the democratic unionists want to see
1992847 at least it is clear that david cameron is thinking about the issue and i think some others need to start thinking about it the debate is on and hes made an opening contribution to it and it is out there to be discussed i dont think we have arrived at a conclusion to that debate but the issue does need to be addressed lets work on it until we find a resolution
1992848 we will do what anybody would expect a mature political party to do we will look at what is in the interests of the united kingdom as a whole we will look at what is in the interests of northern ireland and we will make a decision based on that and that alone
1992849 we have a good relationship with the conservative party and that might lean us in that direction but as you saw with the 42 day vote issues are important to us
1992850 he and his wife bought 15 acres of secluded vacant land in lafayette and proposed a 60 foot tall artificial oak tree with three treehouses a suspension bridge would link them to a new house on the adjacent hill an elevator would connect the house to a garage 25 feet below burrowed 80 feet into the hillside
1992851 in close contact with senior russian and georgian officials were urging moscow to press south ossetias de facto leaders to stop firing
1992852 we call for an immediate end to the violence and for direct talks between the parties
1992853 its important that both sides stop firing that they sit down and they discuss this in a peaceful manner
1992854 an immediate end of the armed clashes and direct talks between the parties
1992855 to refrain from any action that could further escalate the situation and threaten the stability of the region
1992856 the most important thing is to keep people that are lending to fannie and freddie comfortable lending
1992857 they really needed to do that in this market with the private mortgage market basically against the wall they needed to step in and do this this is exactly the sort of circumstances that fannie and freddie were created to deal with in the first place
1992858 oh absolutely not the unique part is this these guys are highly leveraged ive heard numbers of 100 to 1
1992859 well lets say people start getting nervous lets say that they think that there is a possibility that maybe there is such trouble that even if the government promises to help stabilize the situation it wont pan out people could think they just wont have the cash to do it i mean youve got 5 trillion of debt there and obviously not all of that is bad probably a minute portion of that but nonetheless a minute portion of bad debt in that size portfolio with that kind of leverage ratio can be real bad so then it becomes a question of gee should i become a little cautious lending to them and that simply means that people that lend to fannie and freddie bond investors expect a higher premium over the treasury bill and if they demand that higher premium that means that mortgage rates go up thats the big issue
1992860 its all totally hypothetical we just havent been here before this is the first time fannie and freddie have been in significant trouble since they spun off

1992877 you cannot define america without a discussion of slavery in the invention of america
1992878 this gathering is of vital importance because this is a stain on the church thats been around for a long time
1992879 on the pervasive sin that continues to plague our common life in the church and in our culture we acknowledge our participation in this sin and we lament its corrosive effects on our lives we repent of this sin and ask gods grace and forgiveness
1992880 by publicly apologizing it will show that this is not an episcopal problem this is not a christian problem this is a human problem that we have marginalized and oppressed others that we have not regarded every one as gods equal creation but were not going to be that way anymore
1992881 to say that we are in the midst of change is to understate the case
1992882 when we factor in the obama phenomenon in this country and around the world and couple it with the congress of the united states as it prepares to give apology for the nations part in the heinous human crime of slavery the presiding bishops call for this
1992883 a significant part not only of american history but in the formation of american culture
1992884 although the institution of owning human beings in large numbers has been abolished the cultural aspect of slavery has not been
1992885 we need to talk about slavery into the future as it is alive today we still need to have an abolitionists movement because we have abolished slavery as an economy of chattel but we have not abolished slavery in our culture
1992886 occurring at a very significant time in the life of our church and country
1992887 after many years and much effort on the part of so many committed americans various entities are now recognizing acknowledging and apologizing for the roles their groups played in slavery as well as in the post slavery mistreatment of african americans
1992888 that allowed one group of people to own another group to exploit and abuse them for profit
1992889 i think this is what our church must do as it examines its historic role and the long term benefits it derived from the enslavement of millions of human beings in the u s north south east and west it must also consider its complicity in the mistreatment of african americans even after slavery as an institution was abolished
1992890 you cannot define america without a discussion of slavery in the invention of america
1992891 acknowledges our history and then pledges us to a new course
1992892 the fact that we repent of our sin of slavery and the racism that has continued on at the first african american episcopal church the church of absalom jones is significant and very much in keeping with the spirit of the day
1992893 people said why do we want to dig up this history and cause a lot of pain and my answer to that is that theres an inconvenient truth to history in that it is always there whether you dig it up or try to ignore it
1992894 as far as the pain is concerned its obvious that the pain is there the best way i think to deal with such things it to go back into the past and confront it and acknowledge it not to make people feel guilty but just to show them the depth and the background of the problem of racism in the church and in the larger society
1992895 it is the beginning of finding ways for the episcopal church to address the issue of slavery both from its theological aspects in that it is a sin and was a sin and from its political and economic aspects as part of the formation of what we know as the united states of america because you can not define america without a discussion of slavery in the invention of america
1992896 nonetheless i hope people get hope what i want for people is to come out of there saying that this institution that has integrity is not afraid to say we were at fault and we pledge to follow a new course of action and invite others to travel this new road with us

1992899 while rational drug design remains a perfectly valid way to develop cancer therapies we also need approaches that are less costly and more productive of new effective treatments
1992900 you could say this is more of a guerrilla approach instead of screening millions of untested compounds for an agent that inhibits or stimulates a particular molecular target we chose to screen a large library of already approved drugs for novel activity against melanoma cells and then advance the most promising candidate rapidly to clinical practice
1992901 our ability to identify novel treatments for melanoma and advance them rapidly into the clinic very much depends on nyus multidisciplinary approach to melanoma care and research
1992902 to be effective translational medicine cannot be unidirectional discovery moves continuously back and forth between the clinic and the bench we are now focused on determining the range of doses to be tested in the clinic whether specific types of melanomas will respond better than others and whether combining mebendazole with other agents will be of further benefit

1992929 the classic example of a fingerprint is an ink imprint showing the unique swirls and loops used for identification but fingerprints also leave behind a unique distribution of molecular compounds
1992930 some of the residues left behind are from naturally occurring compounds in the skin and some are from other surfaces or materials a person has touched
1992931 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
1992932 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint the image could then be used with fingerprint recognition software to identify an individual

1992940 we hypothesized that sdhx might represent susceptibility genes other than pten for cs cs like syndromes
1992941 our data have important implications for both patient care and genetic counseling i would like to see others independently repeat our observations nonetheless clinicians should consider sdh testing for pten mutation negative cs cs like individuals especially if these individuals have a strong personal history and or family history of breast thyroid or kidney cancer in fact patients with sdhx mutation should be more rigorously screened for these cancers compared to those with pten mutations

1992975 the danish head of their equivalent of our national grid has said quite clearly that from a planning perspective for example wind there achieves a capacity credit of zero for planning purposes
1992976 we have published some scenarios in our consultation document and one of the scenarios that we have illustrated in here which is a scenario with 32 of electricity coming from renewable energy the sort of additional plant you need on the system is about 30 gigawatts of additional renewable capacity coming on by 2020 relative to 2008 and about 17 of additional conventional plant that is just one of the scenarios that we have illustrated in the consultation document
1992977 while it is unlikely to impact energy bills before 2010 in 2020 both gas and electricity bills will be higher due to the cost of renewable energy and it is important to recognise that
1992978 i should say to this committee that i worry greatly about climate change and global warming although i think with one or two exceptions we are winning the argument on that one with one or two important exceptions i think we are winning the argument on that one but i worry more about energy security and national security

1992989 we work 24 hours a day in the wind tunnel
1992990 but we have hit a wall we have only managed to find three percent more downforce this year we just cannot find any more
1992991 we have to see in the car what is the actual performance gain because there is this extra power from the kers systems but there s also more weight or less ballast on the car so it will always be a trade off
1992992 the safety issue is one that s being stressed but it s just an engineering problem and an engineering challenge at the end of the day we carry 70 kilos of fuel around at 200 mph and go round corners it s just a similar engineering safety issue to address
1992993 but to me the crucial thing about kers is that it s inconceivable that in 50 years time when you put the brakes on in your car the energy will just burn off in heat that wont happen but the first thing we need is a system thats capable of absorbing all the energy when you put the brakes on the next generation of formula 1 cars will be like that f1 will make that very small and very light and the things that will fit in next year in 10 years time will look very primitive if we advance it by several years then thats extremely useful and that alone can justify formula 1 because it will make such a huge contribution to the motor industry

1993144 well what if there are six senses and we are just incapable of perceiving the sixth one and therefore every machine theory datum etc we come up with is incomplete
1993145 i wasnt talking about religion i was talking about how mankind is finite and not omniscient which would severely hinder our understanding about the universe
1993146 everything in existence can be divided by two infinitely thus nothing can ever travel from one point to another as it must first travel to the point half the distance it must also travel half the distance to the point half way between the initial points and so forth and so on infinitely each distance having to first be traversed to its halfway point before it can completely span the entire distance

1993196 its squarely in the license holders courts its a shame its kind of locked in this no mans land theres nothing on live arcade theres nothing on wii
1993197 to be fair i kind of wished that the differences got sorted out but obviously theres the licensing issue for bond even if its something thats already come out its incredibly hard to solve because theres so many licence holders involved youve got the guys that own the license to the gaming rights now the guys that have the licence to bond as an ip and there are umpteen licensees
1993198 me just personally i thought god thats a difficult problem to solve the guys wanted to go and make it i guess it probably got to them maybe i dont know but for me i just kind of thought that wed never manage it never quite make it but the feelings not too bad really its what its like as a games developer you have to treat something thats not seen the light of day as a prototype ive had what four or five things that never happened its funny that we dont even talk about them a lot of the time because you think well we might revisit it
1993199 it amazes me i sort of sit on the periphery but i know a few guys in the legal team why cant this happen i want to play it and i want everyone else to play it
1993200 its just what happens legally sometimes not necessarily with games but you see it with music and films things get locked in this legal limbo even most of the parties involved probably all the parties involved want to solve it its such a complex issue it amazes me i sort of sit on the periphery but i know a few guys in the legal team why cant this happen i want to play it and i want everyone else to play it and theyre like well theres this and this and this and that and you have to have approval from them and then theres artist approval all the way up to probably pierce brosnan has to say its all right for this theres not enough hours in the day
1993201 i cant say again infer what you will from that laughs lets just say the last thing about
1993202 gaming changed and started to fracture a lot one studio will find it very difficult to fulfil everybodys tastes unless you get that one golden moment where you get that true breakout game
1993203 no not at all i wouldnt say indifference its nice to see people still talk about it but i also think and a lot of us think this that you look back at it and its still good fun to play but if i played it now with my gaming tastes as refined as they are now would i still have the same reaction or have i really got rose tinted spectacles on its almost impossible to separate one from the other i still look at it and think no its got great level design for instance but then you think im saying that because maybe the control feels really good but its not perfect but its not perfect because the frame rate wasnt high enough its very difficult to separate your memory
1993204 i think sometimes it gets to you a bit when you a get a forum poster say

1993244 quest to expose the suppression by sciences anti theist elite and unveil new scientific facts that may suggest evidence of intelligent design in the universe
1993245 getting a startup running nicely is a constant challenge flippy fork its very important to understand the problem correctly and make the right design decisions this is something we are very happy with now we feel like we only in the last few months really understand the problem we are trying to solve technically solving duplicates and merging correctly is tricky and getting syncs with gmail and highrise to be fast enough has been like blowing fat goo through a thin straw weve greatly optimized our speed in similarity check and merging contacts we are using ec2 so we can scale that and our syncs with gmail based on demand making these sorts of design decisions has been tricky but once its made you know its the right thing to do pink pillow getting the right people on our team has also been very important and were very excited about the guys that are involved with soocial our employees are rock well be expanding our team to about 10 people over the next few months and relocating to amsterdam so it looks like weve found our groove and looking forward to tackling any challenges that come our way over the next months bananas
1993246 although we havent been to the valley as a startup we do get a lot of our inspiration from there

1993249 what about the pseudoscientifc one that says were all one big game of sims for some aliens or something that one is pretty scary when you think it through
1993250 benignrobot im afraid you dont understand whats an infinitesimal whenever you divide by two a distance you divide by two the time necessary to go through it if you do it infinitely you still can add all the pieces to find that the total time is finite it doesnt matter that the adding is infinite since all the things youre adding are small enough to produce a finite well defined result that ancient greek paradox was solved long time ago at least since leibniz
1993251 well what if there are six senses and we are just incapable of perceiving the sixth one and therefore every machine theory datum etc we come up with is incomplete
1993252 i wasnt talking about religion i was talking about how mankind is finite and not omniscient which would severely hinder our understanding about the universe
1993253 everything in existence can be divided by two infinitely thus nothing can ever travel from one point to another as it must first travel to the point half the distance it must also travel half the distance to the point half way between the initial points and so forth and so on infinitely each distance having to first be traversed to its halfway point before it can completely span the entire distance
1993254 what is the source of the pictures to the right of every article heading
1993255 this is why i think that abrahmic religions are implausible
1993256 you are also correct that for reproduction to be sexual it must be between two genders lala hasnt a clue
1993257 matter we havent seen yet that must be there to prevent the known universe from exploding
1993258 energy that we havent seen yet that must be there to drive the universe to be constantly exploding
1993259 surely youre joking i cant believe he did that with a government supercomputer in los alamos
1993260 i could never get into the many worlds thing i just dont buy that theres a universe out there exactly like the one im in only the diet sunkist on my desk just stood up and started singing a negro spiritual and then another where it started singing a negro spiritual but was flat on the fourth note

1993265 when we come to weigh the rights of the several sorts of property which can be held by man and in this judgment take into consideration only the absolute question of justice leaving out the limitations of expediency and prejudice it will be clearly seen that intellectual property is after all the only absolute possession in the world the man who brings out of the nothingness the child of his thoughts has rights therein which cannot belong to any other sort of property land or chattels are pre existing in some form and the rights therein are limited in many ways and are held in the great service of the world but the inventor of a book or other contrivance of thought holds his property as a god holds it by right of creation with his silence or inaction the sustenance and advance of millions yet to be may vanish into the great darkness again his brain has brought the seed out of the infinite planted it in good soil tended it with the care that only the sower can feel surely the world should not deny him a share of the increase he has brought about and if he giving the reversion of his property for all time to his race is granted the product of his creation for half a score of years he should surely be secured against being plundered by the law as well as by the lawless

1993313 generally so the field will be forced to hold an empty string which can be used in string comparisons if you enter nothing rather than null which cant be compared with anything in a select
1993314 after it so that the rdbms knows what to do with any exist null values
1993315 after it so that the rdbms knows what to do with any exist null values
1993316 we dont care what the value is or at least we dont know it so it has no value
1993317 as a default value as the not null constraint stops you entering an empty string anyway maybe its something to do with early versions of mysql being really crap at implementing the relational model
1993318 because its easier to query data when theres no possibility of nulls it also takes slightly less storage and can query slightly faster
1993319 labour force survey reflects stability in the face of economic challenges
1993320 colin is right though that the higher petrol prices may help with reducing carbon emissions
1993321 its hard to swallow the ministers recommendation that nothing needs to be done about regulating an industry making 11 billion profits a quarter
1993322 the nz govt has no power to regulate the global oil companies which i presume that 11 billion refers to it is a red herring figure
1993323 why it takes so long for price decreases in crude oil to come through to the new zealand petrol pump and why it is so quick to get the price increases through
1993324 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
1993325 um insider did you think that this is probably a result of additional govt taxes and the steady increase of the cost of the commodity driven by international events ie war
1993326 if the market was so competitive there would be a far greater competitive fringe growing since the
1993327 you obviously missed gulls entry to the market and the sale of hundreds of retail sites to independents
1993328 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
1993329 though we dont think this type of advertising is appropriate for college sports we have tried this once before in this country and it didnt work very well
1993330 beer promotion during college sports telecasts undermines the best interests of higher education and compromises the efforts of colleges and others to combat sometimes epidemic levels of alcohol problems on many campuses today
1993331 we find it puzzling that ncaa advertising rules prohibit ads for cigarettes other tobacco products organizations promoting gambling and alcoholic beverages yet continue to allow ads for beverages with alcohol content of 6 percent or less beer the top alcoholic drink of college students
1993332 given the devastating problems caused by underage and excessive drinking much of it in the form of beer this policy makes little sense and flouts the core values of sports and learning
1993333 i think weve taken a very sensible very rationale very conservative approach and weve asked that any company that advertises alcohol during our games continue to include the message drink responsibly on its ads
1993334 i think weve taken about as a conservative an approach as any sport in the country while not everyone agrees 100 percent i think we represent what is a good balance in that opinion
1993335 our bylaws lump together names images and likenesses and the names are being used now so well have to go back and look at this

1993340 it might vaporize applications it might simply prevent them from using the gps it might do nothing except upset the privacy advocates who dont like their iphone calling home
1993341 for all we know it could trigger world war three or it could cause some computer somewhere to spit out recipes for buttermilk pancakes
1993342 we are pleased with the direction of our football program

1993350 throughout the 2007 growing season we continued to see signs in support of that a severe drought in the southeast and the early mid september freeze in the upper midwest in early january the global meteorological society agreed that we had made a transition from el ni o to la ni a
1993351 the drought in australia that impacted wheat production last fall and the unusually high amounts of precipitation in southern california and arizona in december 300 percent to 600 percent of normal were very uncharacteristic of la ni as
1993352 there was not a great deal happening in terms of plant development and growth
1993353 by the beginning of june we were still seeing a crop far behind where it should have been for that time of year
1993354 typically we have some area of the state that has crop problems
1993355 but this year its not confined to just one area the flooding and the wet field conditions occurred all across the midwest but iowa is probably the hardest hit the western illinois and nebraska areas have the best crop outlooks at this time the poorest crop outlook is in central iowa north central iowa and eastern and southeastern iowa
1993356 due to all the rainfall we probably had the worst erosion weve had in years
1993357 its been estimated that 30 percent of the corn crop will not be mature by the normal frost dates and the ramifications of that will include a potential cut in crop yields and an extended timeframe for harvest higher than normal moisture content higher drying costs and the potential for lower grain quality
1993358 i dont think weve lost 10 percent in the river bottoms like weve heard and were just tickled to death to have what we have right now which is corn from 6 inches tall to 6 feet tall
1993359 it was starting to go to pot last year the farm to market roads turned to junk we have four semis that haul to the mississippi river and they have to use a lot of extra fuel to go many miles around its going to take months and months to get these roads back into the shape we need
1993360 it reminds me of the sharks that are still out there trying to get a bigger piece of the farmers pie
1993361 if we do that again this year our corn production costs could get to 5 per bushel since wall street doesnt seem to have much of a conscience and companies always have to beat the previous year in terms of profits were going to see fertilizer and seed go even higher than it has
1993362 farmers are just waiting for the next shark to show up and take another piece out of the pie were frustrated out there were thankful that no one in our area was killed in the flood
1993363 will help carry us through this situation well know more as the crops grow at this point we do expect to meet all our needs and still have a modest carryover at the end of the marketing year
1993364 farmers use of key crop inputs is reaching record highs while prices are also at record highs which is putting the pinch on pocketbooks
1993365 with demand for fertilizers expected to grow and no significant increase in short term supplies farmers are likely to continue paying high fertilizer prices
1993366 how the picture plays out for individual farmers will vary depending on purchase times and location
1993367 additionally while 2008 price increases are painful there would have to be an extreme change in the current marketplace for the price tag on fertilizers to lower in 2009
1993368 while at first glance it may seem that this equipment shortage is due to what many are calling the ag boom that is only part of the story
1993369 there has been a structural shift to fewer farms with larger acreages which need different types of machinery
1993370 she wore a traditional wedding gown while ty wore his favorite blue jeans white shirt and cowboy hat the couple is very happy and look forward to enjoying their honeymoon
1993371 its never been more important to think of ways in which best to bring the artist and consumer closer together the exciting thing about this service is that its artist micro sites do exactly that and being mobile it enables the connection to happen immediately
1993372 really low prices and they should be of very good quality thats the only thing we look at we would never look at anything else we would discard anything else that doesnt fall into those boundaries whether its home furnishings or its greentech products
1993373 we will be very active on the boards of these companies i think we can contribute somewhat in terms of commercializing the product they are developing and then obviously distributing the product as well
1993374 within one or two years i think well be between eight and 10
1993375 its quite natural that for instance solar panels are more interesting to spaniards and californians and so forth than they would be to swedes
1993376 initially we will be looking more in europe than anywhere else but we do not have any geographical restrictions for our investments once a company is up and running in five or seven years or something like that and if we exit from that company the money that weve earned in that investment will stay within the ikea greentech fund

1993396 the historical human context in which we work suffer and hope
1993397 if the poet is primarily concerned with earth with displaying particular being and concrete reality
1993398 he will tend to conceive of poetry as a passive art concerned with perception and preservation the ideal of such poetry is naming
1993399 more concerned with world with the historical mythic and spiritual context that the poem creates or invokes he will tend to see poetry as an active art and in some sense even a domineering one

1993411 to introduce new products that initially cost more because they deliver an entirely new level of value to the customer we have some of these types of investments in front of us that i cant discuss
1993412 normally when they introduce a new category it takes some upfront development costs

1993436 this article shows that apparently there is no such thing as a one time plagiarist investigations into cases like these should be done as thoroughly as possible
1993437 its been consciously taught in the classrooms that plagiarism is and will not be tolerated how about in the newsrooms when everyday editors and reporters alike are faced with deadlines do newrooms teach this
1993438 i know full well how hard it is to defend traditional journalism today the right and the left join in a critique that says there is no such thing as an unbiased nonpartisan journalist and that only the despicable msm mainstream media refuse to admit it the failures of established news organizations justifiably lead to public skepticism

1993461 if you want to take advantage of this new 10g feature it is crucial that the statistics are gathered on the actual table because otherwise the column usage monitoring wont work as expected it needs the workload of the actual table not the one of the exchange table

1993484 i have put my pen at the service of some of the most persecuted and misunderstood people in the world

1993487 has been as great it is beautifully written and constructed with delightful prose it is the standard bearer the lesbian the grapes of wrath
1993488 love that smoulders in the shadows of the twilight world
1993489 these women are writing some of the best contemporary fiction
1993490 and the fact that they are not ghettoised speaks to a general loosening up of british society

1993499 we were surprised by the variety of clay minerals in this region
1993500 but whats interesting is that we find the same ordering of the clay materials everywhere in mawrth vallis its like a layer cake of clays one on top of another all these layers are topped with a frosting of lava and dust we can see the clay layers where an impact crater has carved a hole through the surface or where erosion has exposed them
1993501 but it does suggest the long term and common presence of liquid water and concomitant active chemistry on the red planet in the distant past

1993532 if we want to tackle the problem of youth crime we need to take action early to stop kids from embarking on a life of crime before its too late
1993533 the old parties are falling over each other trying to be tough on crime but nothing is being done to stop young people getting sucked in to a cycle of crime
1993534 ministers know that programmes to divert kids away from crime work and are even happy to promote such projects
1993535 however they have failed to fund them properly in favour of punitive policies that grab headlines but achieve little
1993536 there are no radicalized peasants among my main collaborators and those who have been encouraging or carrying out farm invasions in the last few days are not justified

1993540 collectivized farmers were directed to produce regardless of costs and required to transfer their harvests to the state regardless of price
1993541 if farmers and their families were to survive and prosper when food was scarce and incomes from collective labor uncertain they had to allocate their resources as efficiently as possible to maximize profits and minimize losses farmers therefore chose to concentrate on private production for household consumption instead of attempting to expand demand and production under conditions of shortage

1993550 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups

1993552 my measure of when we can call this case closed is when the people of central new jersey feel that they have closure i would say so far its probably not good enough to put all their fears to rest

1993559 this d line can be better than any d line i remember in lsu history
1993560 youve got speed guys strong guys run stoppers pass rushers we have so many guys plus the freshman class thats come in everybodys got their own thing if we fine tune it and put it together i believe we can be one of the best d lines in the country or in lsu history
1993561 even when youre tired youve got to keep going because that guy across from you is going to wait for you to be tired youve got to keep your motor going no matter what if dorsey was hurt or anything was bothering him hed always keep his motor going
1993562 just let that guy roam inside in the middle of a defense and hell be making plays just on athletic ability alone
1993563 i dont know that the piece of glenn dorsey will be replaced
1993564 i think he was exceptional that way but i think our front is awfully talented and i think that as a group they may well play as well statistically as that defensive front did a year ago
1993565 going against these guys in practice is harder than going in a game
1993566 after going back and looking at all the games i played i didnt have the stats that i wanted but i think i did a lot of special things for our team that put us in position to be successful at the end of the season
1993567 if i can repeat that one ohio state game for 14 games thats one of my biggest goals

1993582 rns see the damage done to patients every day by insurance companies
1993583 insurance companies should not be allowed to cancel the health care of innocent patients and the legislature should not allow the governor to water down existing law to benefit his largest contributors
1993584 too many californians discover that the insurance they counted on isnt there at the very time they need it we need strong legislation to make insurers honor the policies they issue and to protect patients unless they willfully misled their insurance company
1993585 health insurance companies are failing to live up to their promises broken promises equals broken people
1993586 it is outrageous that innocent patients have to live in fear of losing their health care coverage i look forward to working with my partners in the legislature to ensure this egregious practice is stopped
1993587 patients gain a victory insurance reinstated for some thousands more get reviews
1993588 as ive said before patients should not live in fear of unfairly losing their healthcare coverage when they need it most and i look forward to working with the legislature to ensure this egregious practice is put to an end
1993589 state fines 2 health plans over canceled coverage anthem blue cross and blue shield agree to offer new policies
1993590 until we achieve comprehensive healthcare reform stopping unfair healthcare rescissions is an urgently needed consumer protection this terrible practice further illustrates the erosion of our healthcare system and the need for comprehensive healthcare reform today we are standing up for consumers by putting an end to a deplorable practice and i will continue working with my partners in the legislature to stop unfair healthcare rescissions once and for all
1993591 insurance companies have an unsavory track record of canceling peoples health coverage for illegitimate reasons just when its needed
1993592 obviously we all have a personal responsibility to be truthful about the state of our health
1993593 en censurant partiellement le projet de loi sur la d mocratie sociale et le temps de travail le conseil constitutionnel vient damputer ce texte de deux dispositions importantes
1993594 ces censures constituent un s rieux camouflet pour le gouvernement qui avait fait de la remise en cause des repos compensateurs et des garanties des conventions collectives concernant les heures suppl mentaires le point dorgue de sa revanche sociale

1993601 le gouvernement proposait aux entreprises de r cup rer largent du beurre apr s avoir eu le beurre
1993602 le conseil constitutionnel a donc en quelque sorte rappel la pr minence de la norme contractuelle ant rieure quand celle ci nest pas contradictoire avec la port e g n rale de la loi

1993672 answered can be just that without being either helpful or solved
1993673 your suggestion then is which please confirm that the answered button which produces a green star in the threads listing indicating that the problem is solved be changed to solved as merely being described as answered does not of itself indicate that a solution was found did i get that right
1993674 this would obviously mean that the solved button that the original poster op can click on in somebodys post the other being helpful would have to be changed or general confusion would arise we need a suggestion for a synonym for solved
1993675 it could be that the original poster marked the thread as answered came to an answer on his her own rather than solved which awards points to the

1993698 this will preserve purchasing power in the medium term and support sustainable growth and employment on the basis of our assessment the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
1993699 have you read about the do over strategy i just recently started reading some about it
1993700 the set of things we can comprehend researching is thus limited to what weve already

1993705 ok i not the only one who feels like this
1993706 one of the most reliable sources of scathing rebuttal to the left wing media has become known for its humorous but biting style his regular verbal assault on labour ministers has quite a reputation
1993707 we like mr eugenides we highly recommend adding him to your blogroll go and read it is absolutely the most glorious stuff
1993708 oh boy i think reading you and devils kitchen is going to damage my psyche what a joy
1993709 the most amusing non stop critique of the labour government available
1993710 my favorite anglo rage boy the best apoplectic brit blogger
1993711 a widely acknowledged political genius of the first order still he finds time to visit greece sink a pint or two and take on the idiots who purport to govern our fair land
1993712 there really is no purpose to be served by following humbly in the wake of the genius of mr eugenides why seek to improve on perfection when one knows in advance that one will fail
1993713 i am impressed with the dexterity of mr e linguistic and otherwise
1993714 i rather enjoyed the retort of the blogger known as mr eugenides
1993715 it really serves no purpose to continue talking about it
1993716 i explained to her that we found out that homosexuals come from large families
1993717 but dad did you check if this factor that makes sons homosexual is not the same factor that makes the mother produce more children and have big families
1993718 there was something in the genes that in the male changed his sexual orientation and in the female increased her probability of having children
1993719 the more we study the more we find there will be other mechanisms
1993720 my theory is not meant to explain homosexuality in all males obviously not in firstborn males
1993721 and it does not explain homosexuality in women at all
1993722 there is no all inclusive explanation for the variation in sexual orientation at least none supported by actual evidence
1993723 but that is compatible with the idea that there are multiple biological pathways affecting sexual orientation
1993724 avec nicolas sarkozy le cynisme politique est au del du sport et devient un art

1993731 not only is moveon orgs anti drilling position out of step with 70 percent of americans but a member like mike conaway who represents the texas oil patch will probably see his approval rating surge upward as a result of these ads
1993732 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
1993733 i dont know if my girlfriend is shes been giving me the lo
1993734 the fuss was justified from the perspective that this is an impactful finding that has the potential to bring down the internet

1993739 i cant let my kids out in my own front yard ive got five acres and i cant let my kids out in front yard because im afraid of what might happen
1993740 to what purpose are powers limited and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained
1993741 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1993742 simplifying the tax system would probably save corporate america more money without expanding the deficit
1993743 and ill rebait your hook you dont even have to reel in just let that lure sit there
1993744 dad we need to hurry and get him back in the water
1993745 ive said all along im trying to represent all of memphis
1993746 while hes in our churches clapping his hands and tapping his feet hes the only senator who thought our kids shouldnt be allowed to pray in school congressman sometimes apologies just arent enough
1993747 hes never voted against prayer in school its an out and out lie this is desperation upon desperation
1993748 we were shocked to see the recent ads run by the nikki tinker for congress campaign we believe the ads are offensive and divisive
1993749 emilys list does not condone or support these types of attacks
1993750 it says memphis has come a long long way and that people who were counting on racial voting to prevail are thinking of a memphis that doesnt exist anymore
1993751 the people of memphis are more sophisticated voters that deal with issues and someones record and not simply race
1993752 this concerns us even though we received claims of premature deterioration on just a small portion of this product
1993753 the deterioration that you would be looking for may be visible cracking on the surface of the products or it could be flaking on the surface of the product that looks out of the ordinary
1993754 remedy the problem up to the replacement of the entire deck if needed
1993755 but how do you account for all the people who say they saw ufos bigfoot
1993756 if there is no bigfoot then what is it that people are seeing and or experiencing
1993757 if there is no bigfoot then what is it that people are seeing and or experiencing

1993761 we are proud to be able to bring large scale solar energy to pueblo
1993762 the csu pueblo campus is the perfect place to demonstrate the clean efficient power that solar can provide to communities throughout colorado and other parts of the u s
1993763 we view this as an extension of the commitment the university and the csu system have made to renewable and sustainable energy
1993764 because this solar array will be visible from new facilities being constructed to support our new athletic programs and the planned development on our eastern campus border it will serve as a strong statement about the universitys commitment to supporting sustainable energy resources
1993765 we are proud to be able to bring large scale solar energy to pueblo
1993766 the csu pueblo campus is the perfect place to demonstrate the clean efficient power that solar can provide to communities throughout colorado and other parts of the u s
1993767 black hills energy is excited to be a part of this project and about the solar energy contribution this system will provide csu pueblo
1993768 combined with the black hills energy solar rebate program biomass and wind resources already in use the csu pueblo solar system builds on black hills energys commitment to renewable energy for the communities we serve in colorado
1993769 in short this project will help control the universitys utility costs as prices and usage increase promote the use of sustainable resources help satisfy black hills energys state mandates and allow bp solar to bring a major solar project to southern colorado
1993770 assembling the combined talents of a team of this caliber ensured results which exceeded expectations our goal was to highlight the effectiveness of public private partnerships to deliver concrete sustainable solutions and we are elated with the result
1993771 for anyone who has ever felt like a 25 year old stuck in a middle aged body
1993772 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
1993773 bills writing is sublime buckets full of good sense so well written you help us to keep on top of issues we would be unaware of otherwise
1993774 i particularly like bill bonners style and values it makes a refreshing change to read something so in tune with my own thinking i look forward to seeing your e letter in my mail box every day
1993775 there seems to have been more or less a straight fight between the states and us as to who actually plunges into a recession first
1993776 a momentous economic slowdown in spain is now under way though just in the beginning stages with the bulk of the pain to be suffered in 2009
1993777 the probability of a crisis scenario similar to the early 1990s is increasing
1993778 the economic situation is worse than we all predicted we thought it would happen slowly but it has hit fast
1993779 the euros 25 to 30 overvaluation against the us dollar
1993780 since 1911 there existed in england a system of unemployment insurance that gave an indemnity to jobless workers known as the
1993781 no religion spread as fast as the belief in full employment
1993782 and in this roundabout way allowed governments that had exhausted their tax and borrowing resources to ressort to the phony delights of monetary inflation
1993783 for months special interest groups seeking to defend the energy status quo have attempted to lay all of the blame for rising food costs at the feet of the ethanol industry
1993784 but the fact of the matter is that virtually every independent study has shown that ethanols impact on food prices is minimal while its impact on lowering gas prices is substantial we applaud the epa for their objective conclusion a strong renewable energy policy will continue to bolster the u s economy and enhance our national security
1993785 the rfs gives confidence to companies like ours who are making a sizable investment in cellulosic ethanol with stability in the marketplace our industry can do even more to improve the environment and lessen our countrys dependence on foreign oil
1993786 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at homeland security they are in charge
1993787 every american should be offended and outraged by comparisons between our dedicated public servants risking their lives every day to enforce our immigration laws and the nazi secret police no matter who is making the comparison that such a vile statement was made by a member of congress is truly reprehensible and irresponsible
1993788 ice actions have been entirely legitimate and carried out in a professional manner in an effort to deal with a national illegal immigration crisis
1993789 such a reckless comparison to the gestapo borders in making such comparisons congressman gutierrez is providing license for people to resist by any means necessary
1993790 fair joins with dhs assistant secretary julie myers in demanding that the house leadership take action against representative gutierrez his statement deserves the strongest possible condemnation from his colleagues
1993791 we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety
1993792 both reactionary religion and militant secularism are on the rise with both displaying a rigid certainty and a desire for power that will do nothing to benefit society in this context it is vital that people with open minded faith speak up and demonstrate alternatives altmuslim com has set many good examples in this regard
1993793 you see more hostility towards muslims now than you did the year after 9 11
1993794 i want my children to grow up in a country where they as muslims feel valued
1993795 success in the sciences unquestionably takes a lot of hard work sustained over many years
1993796 would you be happier if she continued to underacieve and never reach her dream but have an easier time along the way
1993797 i think much of it is cultural weve seem to have lost the realization that there is a lot of joy to be had in learning to do something that is difficult

1993799 i am in faver of tracking but why 7th grade algebra what colleges or universities require multivariate calculus for the freshman science and engineering majors besides cal tech and mit
1993800 the obvious thing for labour to do is get over 51 of the electorate feasting on the public tit and have the other 49 of suckers pay for it
1993801 the alleged gap between public and private sectors flies in the face of the extensive market surveys carried out by employers in the public sector
1993802 in 2001 market surveys conducted by agresearch showed its science staff were paid an average of 20 4 below scientists with the same qualifications knowledge and experience who work in non science industries
1993803 the alleged gap between public and private sectors flies in the face of the extensive market surveys carried out by employers in the public sector
1993804 in 2001 market surveys conducted by agresearch showed its science staff were paid an average of 20 4 below scientists with the same qualifications knowledge and experience who work in non science industries
1993805 actually with mmp that is just about how it works already and labour only needs around 40 of the voters in its pocket
1993806 or are we saying just because they work for the government they should be paid less
1993807 arent we also meant to be attracting the best to do this sort of work
1993808 your fixation on the market is misguided yeah its useful but its not the deity that you and other neo liberals make it out to be its a method of moving goods and services around society no more no less it works more often than not in its own narrow sense but its subject to abuse as any corporate monopoly will show left unregulated all that happens is powerful men fight their way to the top then kill the market by imposing monopolistic controls on it as well as mining their workers and the environment for profits you say we need to increase productivity how can we when its cheaper to hire underpaid staff rather than newer more effective equipment to increase productivity workers need better tools systems and management if this isnt being done then its the fault of individual employers as for more economic growth give up on that one those days are over my friend google peak oil to find out why
1993809 as a nation develops wages tend to increase and that in order to sustain this higher income labor productivity must improve in order for the nation to be competitive in addition what creates productivity in sweden is necessarily different from what drives it in ghana thus the gci separates countries into three specific stages factor driven efficiency driven and innovation driven each implying a growing degree of complexity in the operation of the economy in the factor driven stage countries compete based on their factor endowments primarily unskilled labor and natural resources companies compete on the basis of prices and sell basic products or commodities with their low productivity reflected in low wages to maintain competitiveness at this stage of development competitiveness hinges mainly on well functioning public and private institutions pillar 1 appropriate infrastructure pillar 2 a stable macroeconomic framework pillar 3 and good health and primary education pillar 4 as wages rise with advancing development countries move into the efficiency driven stage of development when they must begin to develop more efficient production processes and increase product quality at this point competitiveness becomes increasingly driven by higher education and training pillar 5 efficient markets pillar 6 and the ability to harness the benefits of existing technologies pillar 7 finally as countries move into the innovation driven stage they are only able to sustain higher wages and the associated standard of living if their businesses are able to compete with new and unique products at this stage companies must compete by producing new and different goods using the most sophisticated production processes pillar and through innovation pillar 9 thus the impact of each pillar on competitiveness varies across countries in function of their stages of economic development therefore in the calculation of the gci pillars are given different weights depending on the per capita income of the nation the weights used are the values that best explain growth in recent years for example the sophistication and innovation factors contribute 10 to the final score in factor and efficiency driven economies but 30 in innovation driven economies intermediate values are used for economies in transition between stages
1993810 the oil age will come to an end not for lack of oil just as the stone age came to an end not for lack of stones
1993811 the fundamental situation is this nature presents the earth as an immense solidly packed ball of chemical elements it has also provided comparably incredible amounts of energy in connection with this mass of chemical elements if over and against this massive contribution from nature stands motivated human intelligence the kind of motivated human intelligence that a free capitalist society so greatly encourages with its prospect of earning a substantial personal fortune as the result of almost every significant advance there can be little doubt as to the outcome man will succeed in progressively enlarging the fraction of natures contribution that constitutes goods that is he will succeed in progressively enlarging the supply of useable accessible natural resources the likelihood of his success is greatly reinforced by two closely related facts the progressive nature of human knowledge and the progressive nature of capital accumulation in a capitalist society which of course is also a rational as well as a free society in such a society the stock of scientific and technological knowledge grows from generation to generation as each new generation begins with all of the accumulated knowledge acquired by previous generations and then makes its own fresh contribution to knowledge this fresh contribution enlarges the stock of knowledge transmitted to the next generation which in turn then makes its own fresh contribution to knowledge and so on with no fixed limit to the accumulation of knowledge short of the attainment of omniscience similarly in such a society the stock of capital goods grows from generation to generation the larger stock of capital goods accumulated in any generation on the foundation of a sufficiently low degree of time preference and thus correspondingly high degree of saving and provision for the future together with a continuing high productivity of capital goods based on the foundation of advancing scientific and technological knowledge serves to produce not only a larger and better supply of consumers goods but also a comparably enlarged and better supply of capital goods that larger and better supply of capital goods continuing on the same foundation of low time preference and advancing scientific and technological knowledge then serves to further enlarge and improve the supply not only of consumers goods but also of capital goods the result is continuing capital accumulation on the basis of which from generation to generation man is able to confront nature in possession of growing powers of physical command over it on the basis of both of progressively growing knowledge of nature and progressively growing physical power over nature man progressively enlarges the fraction of nature that constitutes goods i e the supply of useable accessible natural resources
1993812 notice that in 1968 when ehrlich published his book the population bomb world fertility was already in decline
1993813 utter rubbish single minded blinkered economists view of the world and theres more to life than that sunshine

1993816 the culmination of one of the most spectacular victories of the war on terror
1993817 the destruction of al qaida aqi in iraq is one of the most unlikely and unforeseen events in the long history of american warfare
1993818 we can thank president bushs surge strategy in which he bucked both republican and democrat leaders in washington by increasing our forces there instead of surrendering
1993819 the foremost expert in the world of counter insurgency warfare and we can thank those serving in our military in iraq which engaged local iraqi tribal leaders and convinced them america was their friend and aqi their enemy
1993820 the hearts and minds of ordinary iraqis began in anbar province which had been written off as a basket case and spread out from there
1993821 the cbs evening news the nbc nightly news and cnns anderson cooper 360 were silent about the benchmarks political progress
1993822 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
1993823 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
1993824 denounce it as morally degenerate and unrepresentative of gun owners at large

1993828 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
1993829 i would answer back hard what do you mean hes not one of us its john mccain who wears 500 shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state
1993830 he felt responsible for making a difference in this world
1993831 if they were having a tough day he was the one to step up to the plate
1993832 he died doing what he wanted to do and protecting others
1993833 they lifted off from the helipad they went forward a slight bit then the aircraft rapidly descended and hit the hillside
1993834 the aircraft was in what they call translational lift meaning it had lifted off and was headed out of the helipad and then it went down it was just a matter seconds after it took off i dont know yet exactly how quick the fire started but had to be very very quickly
1993835 we are not a huge company this has had a very severe impact on us we know between the grayback people on the aircraft and our company its been a huge blow to southern oregon and i know its been a huge blow to the firefighting community
1993836 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
1993837 and for kids to have the basic skills and learning environments that are exciting thats the heart of it its just an honor to be in the middle of all of this as state superintendent
1993838 when i see whats best for kids thats what im going to do period i do whats best for kids thats the way i make decisions thats the way im always going to make decisions
1993839 weve gone from the middle of the pack academically to the top of the nation in the last 10 years
1993840 and weve learned to provide options for kids who learn differently and test differently
1993841 what really improves learning is quality teachers and when we focus so narrowly we lose the arts music career and technical education
1993842 i have 50 current legislators supporting my candidacy she has two
1993843 to me thats a tremendous difference and it shows theres no respect for that office and they are looking for new leadership
1993844 we need to take the next jump so i agree we need to move in a new direction but he doesnt have any clue how to do that and i do
1993845 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it

1993849 i cant believe how difficult it is to get everyone together
1993850 colleen said yes then had to switch and kathleen is out of town and it seems like everyone else has changed their available dates at least once ive been on the phone for days trying to get this worked out
1993851 this is one of the important differences between men and woman
1993852 men send out a party invitation and if more than one person wants to change the date we immediately send out an e mail with the subject line damn party cancelled
1993853 to what purpose are powers limited and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained
1993854 and for legal and practical purposes freeman and colley lee have been separated since december of 2007
1993855 these funds must be managed with transparency if the amounts transferred to the regions are known in detail why is the fate of the central government funds being kept secret government accounts should be open to scrutiny at all levels
1993856 one group of companies is lobbying against reporting in detail what each contributes and wants to publish instead only the overall figure for the sector and the government is giving way on this
1993857 this shows the governments lack of commitment and laid back attitude of lets just do what we can regardless of the final result if these companies are going to publish what is already known why should we give them a seal of approval for transparency it doesnt make sense
1993858 there is willingness to act transparently but we must respect the law as the companies are protected by tax secrecy provisions
1993859 only small and medium companies are opposed to publication of their individual tax contributions but they will do so in aggregate
1993860 the reconciliation of tax payments and revenues applying international auditing standards and reporting their opinion on this reconciliation and any discrepancies that are observed
1993861 we have done everything we can to reach a consensus a transparency process is under way begun on an individual basis by the leading companies and now what needs to happen is to make it official and apply it across the industry
1993862 necessary to drive the construction of a process of total transparency because there is a serious crisis of confidence due to corruption and demonstrated by the rise of social conflicts
1993863 you progress not through improving what has been done but reaching toward what has yet to be done
1993864 if the inflation anchor looses its moorings the management of immediate macroeconomic challenges will become even more difficult and the burden on monetary policy will rise likely impeding net exports rebalancing and eventual recovery moreover the cost of subsequently restoring credibility will be high accordingly on fiscal policy the planned medium term fiscal consolidation namely the cumulative structural adjustment of 1 percent of gdp in 2009 and 2010 should be regarded as a minimum it would take an adjustment averaging of a percentage point of gdp per year from 2009 to 2012 to set debt on a path to return under the ceiling by 2012 frontloading to the extent possible would underpin the credibility of that path in any event and in addition any slippage from the cyclically adjusted balance objectives for 2008 announced in the march budget should be made up in 2009 in this context any revision of the fiscal rules should support the credibility of the recommended fiscal stance the 40 percent net debt ceiling should be retained notably through adoption of a clear and short horizon to bring debt back under the ceiling following a breach given the premium on fiscal credibility accountability should be emphasized over flexibility in any redesign of the rules this adds to the case made in the staff report to emphasize nominal expenditure ceilings
1993865 these new projects will result in the infusion of roughly 15 billion in capital investment in the western states and will create 7 000 permanent jobs and more than 25 000 person years of construction and manufacturing employment

1993876 agave can bring in the new era of bio economics giving the world enough clean energy for a peaceful and secure world
1993877 high quality agaves are very good feedstock material for biofuel for the following characteristics high total sugar density and content high weight of the fruit and stems cultivation and harvest cycles of six years high density of plants per hectare genetic diversity and high adaptability low water requirements co2 and capture methane metabolism soil retention plant nutrition products from inulin and low maintenance during cultivation
1993878 agave is the ideal feedstock for an integrated biorefinery where biofuels bioenergy and high profit bioproducts are derived with a zero waste platform
1993879 agave can bring in the new era of bio economics giving the world enough clean energy for a peaceful and secure world
1993880 our enhanced agave tequilana weber variety plants have a sugar content of 27 to 38 brix which is 3 times sugarcanes and weigh around 300 kilos 660 pounds each individual but weve got plants from another agave species that weigh 1 2 metric tons each with sugar content around 25 brix double that of sugar cane this means that annually per acre we could easily get 5 000 gallons of distilled ethanol and fifty metric tons of dry biomass with 33 metric tons of cellulose content
1993881 the technology for producing massive amounts of our enhanced agave variety uniform in sugar content size weight and harvesting time is ready this allows mechanization in the field from establishment to harvesting reducing costs time and labor which in time allows the establishment of very large plantations of agave that is in the millions of hectares
1993882 agave thrives in semi arid wastelands 50 of mexico needs no watering or agrochemicals requires very scarce field labor and grows well in any type of soil even highly degraded and steep terrains because it takes nitrogen from the air one third of the worlds habitable land is arid and semi arid where agave can be cultivated some agave species accept temperature ranges from 14 c to 50 c
1993883 the use of products derived from agaves goes back to pre hispanic cultures
1993884 in the present it is common to find examples of these products in mexico in traditional beverages like tequila mescal and pulque in traditional mexican cuisine arts and crafts and rope and fibers among others agave is a class of plants familiar and part of the national culture a project or program successful in producing biofuel in addition to these would only be a gainful extension of uses already existing
1993885 prospectively we plan with the agro industry to employ agave varieties which requires first of all to continue characterization and selection establishment of an in vitro germ plasm bank for the preservation protection and conservation of original examples of the best of varieties in order to increase the number registered in the national catalog and preserving the rights of ownership and have them available in the genetic and phytosanitary registry for rapid propagation and use by the agro industry this requires the support of government agencies such as ine or others to which this program applies
1993886 i claim that theres no other plant or tree in the world that can produce as much sugar and cellulose cellulose is the organic oil substitute green oil and sugar can be converted into many things agave sugars can be even eaten by diabetics without any risk and have a high probiotic value
1993887 if you make paper or notebooks with that pulp youll get several times more money so the trick is to sell only the lignin biomass and use the cellulose for something else theres a type of cellulose called alpha cellulose with it you can even make food for human consumption its very expensive

1993892 as expected with the big increase in corn acreage this year weve seen a big jump in activity with bollworms
1993893 we scouted several fields in the past two days running 15 to 20 worms per 25 sweeps
1993894 our threshold for bollworms in soybeans is 15 per 25 sweeps or four per row foot on standard row beans these thresholds are solidly based and you should use them to base your decision on whether or not treatment is needed also remember that four per row foot on 38 inch rows is equivalent to two per row foot on 19 inch rows and one per row foot on 9 5 inch rows
1993895 i encourage you to stay close to this threshold if treatment is necessary a pyrethroid will control the bollworms and the stink bugs
1993896 soybean loopers are resistant to pyrethroids but all the beneficial insects that feed on them and keep them in check are not when you remove them from the system it frees the looper to expand its population
1993897 we are seeing them in late planted fields that are blooming and not lapping the middles
1993898 dont just blanket treat treat the fields at treatment levels and leave the other ones alone or youll have the potential to flare other pests
1993899 when sampling with a sweep net remember that bollworms are often far down in the canopy and if youre not sweeping deep into the canopy you will easily underestimate populations be observant and look for the worms down in the plant as you walk through the field

1993938 although we are still waiting for the program rules that will come from washington d c by collecting applications now we can write the conservation plans and be well positioned to provide contracts to producers when rules are promulgated

1993940 nikonian bill ely d50extreme sums up his take on the positioning of the d700 with a simple comparison
1993941 choosing between the d3 and d700 the emergence of the d700 forces shooters considering a d3 to do some additional pre purchase pondering call it the us 2000 question what do you give up if you opt to purchase the significantly less costly d700 the answer is surprisingly not all that much though opinions will vary on the value of this or that feature
1993942 looking at the numbering of the camera it looks like nikon are releasing this model as a go between for the d300 and the d3 which isnt a bad thing after all years ago canon released the eos 50e because photographers wanted eye control focus from the eos 5 but didnt want to pay the same price the nikon d700 appears to be a similar release with features of the d3 but in a somewhat clipped format it shows that nikon are listening to the users and developing gear to suit what people want which is something that nikon are quite rightly very proud of
1993943 google translated we have used an afternoon for the nikon d700 and despite the generous size is manageable as the d300 particularly through the excellent balance of the masses the construction quality is of the highest levels without imperfections even though they still preliminary copies although the d3 remains more robust than that massive
1993944 we think the d700 is going to give the canon a good run for its money and if it doesnt unveil the successor to the eos 5d soon we wont be surprised to see some shutterbugs switching camps to enjoy the power packed features of this nikon shooter but one deterrent could be the price we were told by nikon that while the pricing for the d700 has yet to be confirmed it may lie somewhere in the us 2 999 range
1993945 the nikon d3 has taken the action photography industry by storm motivating many pros to change brands and we expect the d700 to contin5ue that trend
1993946 the d700 excels in the extreme low light and high contrast conditions under which todays cameras are judged and affirms nikons ongoing commitment to meeting tomorrows imaging needs too
1993947 she has never been in any trouble besides this that doesnt mean she didnt do what was alleged

1993966 now still in the films segment is the games business and our games business is ramping up
1993967 over time we expect games to become an increasingly important part of warner brotherss business we have the arrangement with our strategic partner in abu dhabi who is funding up to 250 million to co finance the development of up to 75 games over the next seven years we also have an investment in eidos which is a uk games developer and we distribute all of these
1993968 we are developing at a pace with the size of our distribution presence and we feel that we are in reasonably good shape if you are asking whether we can attract talent that we need we think we can
1993969 we did not expect such numbers we are facing a major phenomenon that can endanger the film industry and other audiovisual industries
1993970 at the core of the record i thought it might be kind of cool to have an element that was kind of unpolished and have the other musicians play around that

1993972 over the years ive built it up to the point where i have a cult following for lack of a better term

1993978 our delegation is trying to provide some sort of feed vouchers in conjunction with the flooding disasters in the midwest
1993979 that flooding of course is also a factor in the rising cost of feed
1993980 were desperately working with colleagues from other catfish producing states particularly mississippi to try to find some relief in the emergency disaster supplemental
1993981 weve been talking to the staff at the appropriations committee trying to bring this home to them to show the severe circumstances our fish farmers and aquaculture are experiencing
1993982 paying more for feed and the number of fingerlings being purchased are drastically down producers cant afford to feed the fingerlings for the price theyll receive at the end of the process
1993983 devastating for an industry weve carefully and tenderly developed its very productive and a good alternative to row crops
1993984 cotton is going to need to have a price rally if were going to hold on to acres in 2009 or weve got to come off these high corn and soybean prices
1993985 yesterday july 23 the december 09 cotton contract was at 85 40 cents corn was at 6 13 soybeans at 13 56
1993986 if that price situation continues and we keep seeing increases in input costs until time for planting decisions to be made next spring we probably could see growers moving a few more acres out of cotton which would put even more pressure on the infrastructure
1993987 with crude oil prices moving between 125 and 145 per barrel energy costs are a major factor for everyone were expecting these costs to remain at about current levels through 2009
1993988 it looks like about another 10 cents per pound in costs of production just for these variable inputs all this translates into a significant squeeze on the bottom line
1993989 got a lot of attention but weve since backed off those and now are generally talking about new york futures trading in the low 70 cent range and the a index of international prices trading in the upper 70s for the last several weeks the market has been trading in a sideways pattern
1993990 in the near term one of the things that continues to weigh on the cotton market is the stocks on hand at the end of the current marketing year july 31 usda is estimating a bit over 10 million bales of carryover and with that level of stocks the market apparently feels short term theres enough cotton on hand to meet demand so weve got some stocks to work through before we can talk about the light at the end of the tunnel for cotton prices
1993991 in early july usda was estimating 14 million bales of u
1993992 if things go well between now and harvest 15 plus million bales is still possible or if things take a turn for the worse over the growing season 12 million bales is possible in the mid south were probably looking at a crop of around 4 million bales with the sharp acreage cutbacks in mississippi were probably talking about only 700 000 bales for that state
1993993 in general the u s crop is not as good as a year ago a lot of whats happening in the market is driven by texas which represents 51 percent of u s acreage this year their yield variability and the amount thats abandoned from year to year can be substantial plus or minus 20 percent on yields is not uncommon and harvested acres can change anywhere from 3 percent to 40 percent all that variability throws quite a bit of uncertainty into what the overall u s crop is likely to be
1993994 mill use and exports should exceed that by a fair amount somewhere around 18 million to 19 million bales that will change the ending stocks situation a lot a year from now probably down to 5 million to 6 million bales that has the potential to make the market look a lot different next july 31
1993995 looking at february april harvest time futures prices for cotton corn and soybeans over the past several years in spring 2006 cotton was 58
1993996 for 2009 the december cotton futures price is 85 40 cents corn 6 18 and soybeans 13 56 if these prices hold and input costs keep rising we could see more acres going out of cotton
1993997 in 2007 u s cotton acreage was down 29 1 percent but in the rest of the world only 1 8 percent in 2008 u s acreage was down another 14 6 percent the rest of the world only 0 8 percent
1993998 well learn over the next three or four months what these other countries have done in response to the u s cutbacks we know u s acreage has shifted because of stronger prices for grain and soybean prices relative to cotton we werent seeing a lot of that in other countries until the last few weeks reports coming out of china india turkey and other big producers are indicating reduced acreage and thats another development that has a chance to get the attention of the market once we learn more about what theyve actually done
1993999 if grain and oilseed prices stay strong and strength continues in the vegetable oils markets wed have to think cottonseed prices will continue strong
1994000 its clear the world crop is not going to be as large as world consumption of cotton
1994001 were going to chew through some stocks hopefully we can continue to keep demand strong the economy is always going to be a concern as are higher energy costs and more competition for the consumers dollar
1994002 we needed to eliminate various manual interventions such as assigning claims to adjustors
1994003 and our ability to implement sophisticated web based interactions with our business partners agents and policyholders was limited or nonexistent because our legacy systems werent scalable
1994004 eventually we evaluated 15 vendors during 2003 but nothing fit
1994005 around this time claimcenter unlike other systems which incorporated claims into lines of business guidewire treated claims management as a core application that spanned all business lines another key feature was robust rules based claims assignment
1994006 the first phase was property claims which required 26 internal interfaces
1994007 guidewire representatives advocated using the agile methodology which further breaks down projects into sprints incremental development cycles in all we completed 16 sprints during the first phase some of which ran concurrently
1994008 using sprints we could demo something live to our claims department about every 30 days
1994009 this permitted each sprint to build on what we learned from the one before
1994010 also our adjustors can stay focused on settling claims instead of answering inquiry calls
1994011 since anyone with access rights can quickly determine the status of a claim our call center has taken over handling inquiry calls which currently average about 7 000 per month

1994013 when we envision the church as an idealized family we are not very capable of welcoming the stranger when family is the only metaphor we use people with whom we cannot achieve intimacy or with whom we do not want to be intimate are squeezed out since intimacy often depends on social and economic similarities church then becomes a place of retreat rather than true hospitality such a church does everything in his power to eliminate the strange and cultivate the familiar such a church can neither welcome the stranger nor allow the stranger in each of us to emerge

1994049 ministers are preparing to open the way for genetically modified crops to be grown in britain on the grounds that they could help combat the global food crisis
1994050 i think the debate about higher prices and being able to meet the demand of people in the world for food is a perfect opportunity to make the case for gmo crops we may have a window of opportunity here and i would encourage you to exploit that

1994056 the palestinian ministry of health has assumed full responsibility for these cases at a cost of 2 000 dollars per person per month the pna also takes care of counselling and related medical follow ups as well as unrelated treatment including dental care and surgery
1994057 our five year project will involve researching high risk groups such as prostitutes and gay men whom we know very little about due to the taboo nature of these issues in our highly religious and conservative society
1994058 we plan to use a snowball effect of establishing where we believe these groups are operating and then studying their dynamics by approaching womens shelters womens jails and perhaps the police
1994059 apart from establishing contact with prostitutes and gay men two of the highest risk groups we are also trying to educate men about the necessity of using condoms
1994060 traditionally sexual reproductive health issues have targeted women as men in our patriarchal society have regarded this as primarily a womens issue
1994061 the palestinian national aids council held a world aids day conference in the west bank and gaza in december of 2006
1994062 a palestinian man who was suffering from aids introduced himself and explained his circumstances not only was the audience sympathetic and interested but afterwards a prominent muslim leader and a prominent christian leader hugged and kissed the young man it was very moving and this helped people to understand that aids sufferers were neither dangerous nor a threat to other people

1994065 to what purpose are powers limited and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained
1994066 the government has called on its people asking for self sacrifice for people willing to devote themselves to the nation and it has picked out its own heroes its just like the great mass movements of the past
1994067 street hairdressers have been given red armbands and are able to report any misdemeanours or bad behaviour to the government anyone who stands out from the crowd anyone who might arouse suspicion people who have come in from the countryside to petition the authorities about local injustices people who are shabbily dressed these people with red armbands have the authority to make citizens arrests or to hand them over to the police
1994068 there are fascistic elements to it this idea of the mass cleansing the purging of the city of the disabled and mentally unstable of all subversives and outsiders
1994069 inflated pride the fusion of years of nationalistic propaganda with the economic powerhouse china has become has created a feeling that its now the centre of the world and that foreigners come to them with begging hands
1994070 the root of this desire to put on a great show stems from the authorities own loss of faith in themselves and they also realise that despite the great rise in nationalism the people dont believe in this empty ideology either
1994071 but slowly especially in this last year theres been a change of mood and many people are beginning to feel as though they are pawns in a huge game that their lives have actually become less free more restricted theres this great feeling of nervousness
1994072 a country that relies on police on the military to retain control will find that in such a situation any underlying discontent will burst out
1994073 the government said this is nothing to do with the olympics but there is a feeling that there is some organised effort to make a stand
1994074 i feel that the general mood in the country is that theyre waiting theres almost an expectation of some sinister event and its not just the people who are feeling nervous its the whole nation including the authorities theres almost this feeling of impending doom you go on to the tube in beijing and youre checked as thoroughly as if youre boarding a plane tiananmen square that vast supposedly public plaza is riddled with plainclothes policemen who check your shoes and bags so one has to ask oneself what has this event given to china it was supposed to bring china into the west but all it has achieved is the demolition of great swathes of traditional chinese life all thats left now is the communist party and possibly 80 national leaders attending the opening ceremony and a few sportsmen fighting over gold medals
1994075 i couldnt ask why was he arrested who arrested him where was he taken how exactly did he die there was no way of finding out but it made me understand why my father lived in such fear all his life and it was only when my father died that i found in his drawer a self criticism hed written and realised that he lived in constant fear of being arrested
1994076 there is an inescapable bond but if i wasnt her father i would be the kind of person she would have nothing to do with
1994077 i feel like ive come through customs but am still collecting luggage
1994078 i was there in the mass of sweaty bodies swaying the square
1994079 not only because i might have ended up among the dead but also for my work as a writer many people who witnessed tiananmen firsthand have been unable to write about it and that distance and the fact that i had to reimagine it and piece bits together means that ive been able to look at it in the cold light of day and really examine its importance

1994093 all we know is that the iphone downloads a list of malicious urls
1994094 for all we know it could trigger world war 3 or it could cause some computer somewhere to spit out recipes for buttermilk pancakes
1994095 truly malicious software is going to find a way to burrow deeper into the iphones operating system so that a simple mechanism like this wouldnt affect it so really the only type of applications this could effectively kill off are applications that are annoying to apple but not malicious that certainly calls for a lot more concern
1994096 the division between the ict haves and have nots now runs through the heart of the continent geographically and generationally

1994108 it isnt helped by a frequently screened scene of director writer producer narcissicist morgan spurlock standing outside a cave in afghanistan whispering osama
1994109 its a little insulting to all the real reporters whove died in the field looking for hard information not weak indie comedy

1994111 i cant say i really got much out of it personally no
1994112 im guess im still a yuppie lefty from the inner city at the end of the day i dont need to learn its lesson but i can totally respect what youre doing and how those who need to learn it will benefit
1994113 i think it needs to be broken down into real simple ideas for me i dont want to make a movie for somebody who smokes a pipe and wears an ascot or is at the protests
1994114 i want to make a film for as wide an audience as possible not for someone whos on one side of an isle and hopefully through comedy and through the way we tell a story and through making it not complex or something real deep that you have to be well educated or read the newspaper every day to understand you can reach a real general audience i want the guy who sees the dark knight to be the same guy who sees where in the world is osama bin laden you know because its fun and its entertaining and its a movie
1994115 we have this whole idea of things having to be highbrow
1994116 and i dont buy into that i think if you really want to reach people you have to make it something that everybody likes
1994117 people like chocolate and vanilla and i like chocolate and vanilla so i think you have to really make it easy and at the same time make it cool
1994118 anything else would be a lie and i think would ultimately produce a shallow piece of work that would truly be smug because id have the audacity to somehow think i communicate what i communicate with complete intellectual objectivity theres your irony
1994119 if youre a knowledgeable lefty then its not telling you anything you dont already know and its doing so in a fairly uninteresting way if youre one of the great bogan unwashed specifically in america then using sub titles means that audience wont watch it
1994120 thats the thing about us evil advertising people the response is part of the actual material
1994121 okay so he doesnt deal with complex models of thought and analysis and he leaves stuff out etc etc and you can oull apart his arguments easily
1994122 as well as this your confusing two categories audiences and writers of course audiences dont need qualifications id suggest that its better if writers do
1994123 do these people actually think that the rest should be able to understand things on their terms
1994124 to what purpose are powers limited and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained

1994149 the tunnel built in the 1930s is a 20 foot wide rectangular concrete conduit that ranges between 11 and 18 feet tall
1994150 the rio grande forms the longest section of the border between the two countries but what happens to that border when the river itself changes course
1994151 to try to prevent the rio grande from changing course and causing more border disputes the mexican and american governments have spent millions on course corrections and flood control programs including the construction of canals dams and levees
1994152 occupies territory that used to be part of texas but for the last 15 years the town and the land have belonged to mexico even though most of the fewer than 1 000 residents who were born here claim american citizenship
1994153 the fence will affect 21 wildlife management areas and refuges in the rio grande valley short and long term negligible to moderate adverse impacts on wildlife and aquatic resources will be expected
1994154 the system is designed to handle the rain that accompanied deadly hurricane beulah in 1967 but that there are portions of the levee that could overtop with storms of a lesser magnitude portions of the levees in hidalgo county are between 3 to 9 feet below the height they should be according to ibwc
1994155 that the red cross wouldnt set up shelters in the rio grande valley until after the hurricane had passed
1994156 have any hydrological studies been conducted to assess the potential impact of proposed border fence on the stability of the flood control levee systems in both southern texas and northeastern mexico and what is the probable impact on the rio grande valley region if the levee systems in either texas or mexico should fail if hydrological studies have indeed been conducted who were the researchers what are their credentials and what was the type and quality of the data used to reach the conclusions reported in the eis if any legitimate hydrological studies relating to this topic actually exist their methodologies data and results should be discussed in open forum so that the people who live here can judge for themselves whether or not conclusions reported in the eis are valid
1994157 that plan significantly cut back the amount of private land that would have to be used for the project in hidalgo county by building a concrete wall into the riverside of the existing levees that way the county would get its needed flood protection and homeland security would meet congress mandate to build a barrier along 670 miles of the u s mexico border san benito texas based ballenger construction co won the 21 4 million contract to build the 1 76 mile granjeno segment pasadena texas based ser construction partners won the 12 million contract for the donna segment which is just under a mile long
1994158 this only makes sense if you work for the department of homeland security the same government agency that failed the people of mississippi and louisiana during hurricane katrina
1994159 they designed a wall that will cost american taxpayers 16 million per mile to build in some sections 50 billion over the years
1994160 the only places where they are paying to rebuild the levees are in areas where border patrol identified a need for a wall
1994161 the government is paying to repair the levees in bits and pieces
1994162 emergency or law enforcement personnel wont be able to rescue people or property when fire flood or crime requires help
1994163 wildlife wont be able to access the life giving resources of the rio grande river people and wildlife in many cases endangered species will die congress and president bush should grant them relief and stop building an absurd border wall that endangers lives
1994164 at another segment about eight miles east of the santa ana national wildlife refuge at least one crane had started peeling away grass from the side of the levee pasadena based ser construction partners ltd won the contract for the 0 9 mile segment
1994165 since the congressional research office estimated 49 billion for 700 miles of border fence then its reasonable to expect that movable fencing will cost taxpayers even more plus the government will need to pay someone to move the fencing when disaster looms sounds like whoever gets the contract will also deserve hazard pay add that to the nations already bloated border security costs cant wait to see which private company gets the fat contract to move the fence before major flooding events
1994166 in chapter 1 loomings ishmael introduces himself with a mixture of chattiness seriousness and humor he speaks of his temperament the call of the sea and contends that every man wants at least once in his life to leave the land behind for the ocean

1994171 the number of iraqi security force units deemed capable of performing operations without coalition assistance has remained at about 10 percent
1994172 the government has not yet established the commission needed to reinstate former baathists in the government in addition the government has not enacted legislation that will provide a legal framework for managing its oil resources distributing oil revenues or disarming militias
1994173 the dangerous and volatile security conditions continue to hinder the movement and reconstruction efforts of international civilian personnel throughout iraq
1994174 al daeda in iraq remains highly lethal and maintains a significant presence in parts of the tigris river valley ninewa province and other areas of iraq according to an mnf i report aqi is now predominately based in northern iraq especially in mosul where frequent high profile attacks continue
1994175 the number of trained iraqi security forces may overstate the number of troops present for duty according to dod the number of trained troops includes personnel who are deceased or absent without leave
1994176 although the law was enacted in february 2008 implementation of the law has stalled delaying the possible reinstatement of an estimated 30 000 former government employees

1994230 vermont is not a norman rockwell place that illusion was never reality it is a poor secular culture with scenery and church steeples

1994237 if someone comes in and says hey you want to peddle this
1994238 but in many ways they need us they need the store if you take that away i think a lot of people know theyll lose something precious

1994251 i commend the navy and their personnel for taking part in this great charity event the navy has participated in the nsw variety bash for the past 6 years and has raised more than 250 000 to assist special needs australian children
1994252 the team has raised more than 50 000 for variety this year its another example of the navys commitment to our community and to helping sick disabled and disadvantaged aussie kids
1994253 during the 4 000km journey the navy team will also visit schools to talk about careers in the navy and the opportunities that exist
1994254 the bash is an opportunity to get out into the bush and help those in need while having a bit of fun along the way

1994275 in the male gonad the major blood vessel in the adjacent tissue comes apart and the individual blood vessel cells move to a new location and reassemble into new vessels inside the testis
1994276 this breakdown process represents a possible way for growing tumors to access a blood supply by commandeering a mechanism similar to the ones organs use to recruit vessels into the tumor
1994277 we were positioned to convert that to a live imaging system when advances in microscopy became available at duke university medical center
1994278 the duke department of cell biology has an imaging facility that is really outstanding and our chair brigid hogan has put a lot of energy into making sure it is state of the art one of the authors on this paper tim oliver who manages this facility helped us to get the imaging set up
1994279 we had to work a lot of kinks out of the system for example we were exposing the organ to a laser to detect the fluorescent vascular cells throughout the duration of the culture but too much laser light damages cells you need to create a bright enough fluorescence in the cells so that you dont have to turn the laser on such a high setting that it kills cells during the culture period
1994280 our goal now is to have different colored fluorescent markers for other types of cells in the organ i hope we can simultaneously image the vessels and other cells as the vessels move into the organ so we can see how they interact together as a functional organ is forming
1994281 auction rate debt has interest rates that reset through periodic auctions typically held every seven 28 or 35 days

1994284 we need to recognise that the very worst course of action in these circumstances would probably be to start up a new far left socialist group as if were just one short of the number of groups we need
1994285 to play their most effective role maybe the socialist of today has to accept the predicament theyre in in which millions reject the ethics of our rulers but few are willing to embrace socialist organisation
1994286 it must be possible to bring together in every area a group of people who are appalled by the priorities of those who rule and agree on a series of values and actions that can dent the agenda of war and profit
1994287 but the first and most important answer to the question what should we do is to take the monumental leap to do something to participate in the continuous rumble against injustice to donate the pound respond to the bullying remark write the letter harangue the woman with the clipboard whos shut down the tea bar draw up the petition against tesco express boycott the fruit or decide to stop a war
1994288 now for the most part analytic studies are continuous and not to be pursued by fits and starts or fragmentary efforts mathematics for instance intellectual philosophy amp c were all become insupportable to me i shrunk from them with a sense of powerless and infantine feebleness that gave me an anguish the greater from remembering the time when i grappled with them to my own hourly delight and for this further reason because i had devoted the labour of my whole life and had dedicated my intellect blossoms and fruits to the slow and elaborate toil of constructing one single work to which i had presumed to give the title of an unfinished work of spinozas viz de emendatione humani intellectus this was now lying locked up as by frost like any spanish bridge or aqueduct begun upon too great a scale for the resources of the architect and instead of surviving me as a monument of wishes at least and aspirations and a life of labour devoted to the exaltation of human nature in that way in which god had best fitted me to promote so great an object it was likely to stand a memorial to my children of hopes defeated of baffled efforts of materials uselessly accumulated of foundations laid that were never to support a superstructure of the grief and the ruin of the architect
1994289 thank fuck lets get out of here i need a piss
1994290 weve been receiving great feedback on live mesh from the beta community
1994291 people are still coming to terms with what live mesh is because it can be a lot of things it can synchronise access to files and folders be used for terminal services or as a development platform
1994292 users like the unified effort around device synchronisation and the ability to have storage on the cloud but access it in offline mode as well
1994293 support for multiple devices and platforms is on our roadmap we want to create a fully integrated heterogeneous environment
1994294 both live mesh and skydrive offer cloud storage but if i make changes to a document and resave it the changes are automatically reflected in the mesh whereas with skydrive you have to upload the changes manually
1994295 because its a collaborative platform it allows people to share folders and documents synchronise any changes to them and to effectively work in groups
1994296 the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1994297 they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards

1994305 throughout history it has always been discontent not satisfaction that motivated progress of the species

1994320 were worried about privacy rights we support the effort to reduce driving but the devils in the details when you see how this bill plays out
1994321 you cant install the tracking technology they want to use into cars made before 1996
1994322 were worried that the new technologies would collect more than just mileage info but also where you drive and when which could then be subpoenaed as is the case with fastrack devices in divorce cases
1994323 since mileage verification can be implemented without tracking devices the bills failure to prohibit them appears to be tacit support for the companies plans to get such devices into cars
1994324 gps technology will not be required at all for pay as you drive insurance so long as i am commissioner
1994325 they only want to capture miles brakes and gas data and i will prohibit the collection of other info such as where motorists are driving
1994326 that real time feedback is important to people so they can see that when they drive less they save once a month once a week once a day thats all up for debate but once a year is not frequent enough for people to alter their driving behavior or to get the idea that when they drive less they save
1994327 they can choose to participate or not and some companies may offer the new policy but choose to use other verification methods for mileage this bill gives more flexibility to companies so they can be more competitive
1994328 roughly 88 percent of a drivers transportation costs remain much the same on a monthly basis regardless of how much he or she drives
1994329 its a bipartisan bill because it has elements that both parties can get behind for democrats its air pollution green incentives encouraging people to drive less for republicans its the fact that it will save consumers money
1994330 it makes good sense to allow insurance companies to choose how to charge people for their services i dont think it will actually get people to drive less
1994331 in a pilot test conducted in texas motorists mileage was reduced dramatically
1994332 and low income drivers drive less so they would have an opportunity to save
1994333 presumably there will be a discount to people who are more honest about how much they drive but there are no guarantees

1994336 when you look at all the technology governed by quantum physics its not unreasonable to assume that if one can apply chaos theory in a meaningful way to quantum systems that will provide new insights new technology new solutions to problems not yet known
1994337 this type of common behavior has been a signature of classically chaotic newtonian systems mostly studied using a computer but it never had been observed in an experimental system that only can be described by quantum mechanics
1994338 when you have a chaotic system that is characterized by extreme randomness it paradoxically can produce ordered behavior after a certain amount of time
1994339 there is strong evidence that is happening here in our experiment
1994340 when things get atom small our notions of being able to put a specific particle in a specific place with a specific speed at a specific time become blurry
1994341 although they are held in place in the crystal structure the spins can interact with each other and change the direction in which theyre pointed in much the same way that magnets interact with each other when brought close together
1994342 somehow despite the fact these spins have very complicated interactions with each other and started out in completely different orientations they end up all moving in the same way after several milliseconds

1994442 i was a bit disappointed to see that the w300 didnt get the nicer 5x optical zoom that is found on the w150 and w170 however i still feel the sony cyber shot dsc w300 is an awesome ultra compact model that features unrivaled resolution capabilities
1994443 it is a truth universally acknowledged that as the pixel density increases on a sensor so the noise goes up ruining images with ugly grain like spots so why doesnt a camera with an absurdly high pixel density produce awful pictures we have taken photos of plain skies and there is no mottling we have taken portraits and there is no noise in the shadows alongside noses and under eyes we have photographed old cars with shiny brightly coloured bodies and there is no fudging of detail at 100 per cent enlargement there is some evidence of noise reduction blurring of fine detail but it is so well done that it is comparable with the best after camera noise reduction software ok lets go out on a limb here this is the best compact that we have tested the sony w series has always been good but this one is amazing

1994462 in a conventional planar camera parts of the images that fall at the edges of the fields of view are typically not imaged well using simple optics the hemisphere layout of the electronic eye eliminates this and other limitations thereby providing improved imaging characteristics
1994463 optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses hemispherical detector arrays are also much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design with many new application possibilities

1994484 hes a man of considerable intellect im rather sorry i didnt write my book in chinese as he reads chinese
1994485 its always an excellent idea for australia to offer prizes i think they are better than subsidies
1994486 australia is a big reading country per capita but it has a small population
1994487 the market is hardly big enough to support an author so prizes really mean something
1994488 an impressive indication of the outstanding breadth and quality of modern australian literature
1994489 a real statement from this government that they want to celebrate australia
1994490 they show we believe we have fiction and non fiction that is as good as anywhere in the world
1994491 we didnt recognise peter carey in australia until he won the booker prize then when he did it was safe for us to say he was a great writer this prize is saying we dont have to look outside our shores for others to say our writing is good
1994492 i think its fantastic to have a prime minister who is interested in reading books
1994493 if this is just an excuse to get him to read 14 good australian books then hell be the better for it and well be the better for it

1994496 we are delighted to be able to open the doors of the convention to the public on this historic night
1994497 there is a growing movement for positive change in colorado the west and across the country and what better way to foster it then to have more americans participate in the fourth night of the convention
1994498 thanks to the hard work of the convention staff the denver 2008 convention host committee the city of denver and the support of the obama campaign and the democratic national committee we will be able to ensure that the people of colorado who have helped make this convention possible will be represented in a significant way when barack obama accepts our partys nomination
1994499 when we said we wanted to open the doors of this convention to the community we meant it
1994500 colorado residents have been dedicated partners in making this convention a reality now we want to make it easy for them to be a part of this historic night
1994501 i am delighted such a large portion of the seats at invesco field at mile high will go directly to coloradans
1994502 through exciting public programs and civic engagement efforts our goal has always been to bring the convention out into the metro denver community
1994503 now we can bring more of metro denver inside the convention itself the thursday night event at invesco field at mile high is a tremendous op portunity for local residents and we encourage everyone who is interested in attending to contact the colorado campaign for change and take part in this historic process whether you have the opportunity to experience the event firsthand or watch it on television the rocky mountains and the denver skyline will provide a stunning backdrop to this important night of democracy in action
1994504 one of the best ways we can introduce colorado voters to our campaign and our vision for this country is getting them involved in the convention
1994505 we are delighted that the dncc is allocating so many community credentials to our state it will allow color ado voters of all parties who want take a look and a listen to our message of hope the chance to do so in person

1994510 contraceptive options well gee we thought wed stick with our previous method i call it not injecting myself with hormones and blood thinners on a daily basis and not borrowing somebody elses ova and not having my beloved husband have some private time in the doctors office with a dixie cup and not having a fertility technician carefully push one of the little swimmers towards our ever so thoughtfully donated ovum and then not growing the zygote in a petri dish until either 3 or 5 days depending on quality and then not transferring it back into my uterus but you probably have some fancy medical term for it
1994511 honey how will we keep from getting pregnant again too soon
1994512 now we cant have that happen again better ask about contraception right away
1994513 i dont suppose we have to discuss contraception do we
1994514 how about taking the head from a newly dead ob resident and using it as a cervical cap

1994517 if one scientist is theoretical and the other is a great lab administrator they can be very productive
1994518 a sense of timing with regard to criticism is so important because partners are emotionally as well as intellectually interdependent
1994519 we each combine a rational pragmatic way of solving the problem at hand with a kind of jumping all over nonrational approach
1994520 a lot of times they both have ideas and they want to get them out there and one feels theyre interrupting the other
1994521 bob can be very dramatic intentionally so they push each other so in the end the design is much stronger than if one person had done it
1994522 being married gives us twice the opportunity for abrasion but it also makes life more graphic vital vivid and intense and if you dont argue good things dont come out
1994523 denise takes bob places that he does not otherwise go
1994524 and then bob will go deep in those areas but so will denise so they are very complementary
1994525 all its done is make everyone write about my womans problem whereas the solution is to write about my work
1994526 i dont really think that much in terms of her versus me
1994527 when im giving a lecture and i cant think of a word in the middle of it ill look down and say the word and shell know it
1994528 one of our clients said when you have robert venturi and denise scott brown together you have double your problems theres no retreat
1994529 i sing it with nonsense stories about a farm like the chickens like to go see the cows that allows me to plant the song so marcy knows what rhythm the lyrics need to follow
1994530 marcys written with other people ive written with other people which can be like birthing an elephant a really painful experience
1994531 theres a bit of fairy dust involved in the whole thing but at the core is our friendship
1994532 i hate doing dishes at my own house but if marcy hasnt done hers its an indicator that shes sad
1994533 i always say aaron is my husband and marcy is my wife
1994534 my husband is really supportive of what we do but hes bewildered by the bond marcy and i have
1994535 when youre doing something that requires you to be so out there emotionally its a relationship thats hard to replicate
1994536 their energy is so infectious some teams stay together out of fear or for financial reasons but marcy and zina have a natural collaboration they see the world through the same prism
1994537 when youre pursuing this craft on this level theres a lot at stake
1994538 there always a lot of pressure to create whats popular what we recognized in each other was our own need to live close to our own souls i knew that working with zina would take my voice the farthest it could go
1994539 over the next five years we were intensive artistic collaborators
1994540 our lives revolved around teaching ourselves how to build robots our day jobs just paid the rent
1994541 it was a big learning experience for both of us
1994542 we went from low tech artistic sculpture to cutting edge robotics we were not stellar in a lot of areas such as math
1994543 theres barely any conflict neither of us is hugely dramatic or verbal jeff is a great designer intuitively and if he says hes going to take on a task he will actually do it and get it done
1994544 we are both good at compromising and respecting each others ideas
1994545 what ive learned from aaron is his ability to concentrate without being distracted hes really pushed me to do the same especially when we were working 10 to 15 hours a day including weekends for eight months to make domo
1994546 people respond to it partly because aaron and jeff prioritized aesthetics something a more rigid engineering type wouldnt have done
1994547 it was a minor alteration but aaron said no because it looked horrible
1994548 if i have a girlfriend shes going to have to be good friends with jeff
1994549 wed like the company to become a creative playground as well as a functional lab
1994550 were still working out who will do what for the businesses
1994551 it would be hard for us to survive without each other
1994552 im anal retentive organized tactical and pragmatic chrissy is creative she can have a million things going on at once and thats when i tighten the reins on her
1994553 i tend to love so many different designs but she will step right in and tell me which ones to focus on and develop shes got a great eye
1994554 i would work hard somewhere else but having personal financial investment in this company definitely motivates me to put everything i have into it
1994555 my sister was used to doing everything and it was hard for her to relinquish control and sit back and create
1994556 i pointed out that they have a classic ceo coo relationship where chrissy generates ideas and nicky figures out how to make them happen
1994557 is that business arguments can bleed into the personal and personal arguments can bleed into the business but overall hope amp glorie is helped by the fact that they have an established relationship they really trust one another
1994558 when we were little mom would always sit us in front of shirley temple movies
1994559 we do bicker especially as the stress of pulling together a collection piles on
1994560 sometimes ill ask her a question about work and then ill realize that i didnt ask how her day was

1994567 the high bills in texas demonstrate what a huge mistake deregulation has been
1994568 the legislature created this monster and only they can change it but they wont unless they hear from citizens
1994569 these prices arent about deregulation and the market its about natural gas prices and limiting of other options of producing power like limits on coal and nuclear
1994570 we will see the benefits in time and you cant go back on deregulation

1994579 most insurers have really not dealt with the huge book of business that they transact with agents on a daily basis
1994580 we are taking this approach because we believe it will differentiate us from our competitors and because we have a technology platform that enables us to do it
1994581 we issue a policy to a customer in 10 days and issue endorsements to agents in the same time frame
1994582 we have a 24 hour turnaround for more than 50 percent of our business
1994583 pools without anti gaming logic can do more damage than good it completely reverses the entire philosophy behind a dark pool because youre going in there to be anonymous and if someone is not in there putting some constraints on their activity and monitoring their activity its a useless cause
1994584 its a big topic we all know there are certain types of traders who are looking to lever off of liquidity and they do it in the open market they do it on the nyse and nasdaq and thats been around a long time
1994585 these new dark liquidity pools and atss alternative trading systems just offer a new venue to do that
1994586 the key is that your general institutional investor may not want its flow exposed to those types of counterparties so our job when we build a pool is to build in anti gaming logic to protect the quality of the venue
1994587 in java you take the remainder with the operator is informally called the modulus operator sometimes called mod or modulo though mathematicians and serious computer scientists would beg to differ it is a remainder operator not a modulus the jls correctly refers to it as a remainder operator
1994588 what exactly constitutes the result of a modulo operation depends on the programming language and or the underlying hardware
1994589 in the 1960s a mafia don was only as strong as his family
1994590 we found the hierarchical culture of organized crime intriguing running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one the dons view is so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new

1994596 support dell com choose your country or region from the drop down list said i am from australia i have a 9300 shipped june 05 that started developing the vertical lines issue since late last year the slowly increasing number of lines got over me in march 07 so i got in contact with technical support they arranged for an support agent to come and replace the lcd no hassles and quite pleased however within a month the lines start to appear again i have now got about 20 lines and have just lodged a request with technical support again i hope that the article above means that dell finally know what the root cause is and would not continue to send out parts with the same issue said i sent an email in to vertical line dell com on may 1st after having recieved a letter from dell stating i could get a refund for the screen i replaced that developed this problem i havent recieved a reply yet i also tried calling the number refered to in the letter about 4 times and gave up in frustration when they people on the other end had no idea what i was talking about even after i had given them the dsn mentioned in the letter said i have a dell inspiron 510 m with 30 vertical lines on the lcd 30 vertical lines so in april dell admitted to dell inspiron 9200 9300 and dell xps gen 2 notebooks now in june they add inspiron 6000 and 8600 latitude d800 and d810 and dell precision mobile workstation m60 and m70 maybe one day when i have no screen left and its all a rainbow the inspiron 510 ms will also be included please address these serious concerns from these troubled customers or at the very least make it known that their concerns have been met it would be a shame to see more customers go because of faulty parts from bad suppliers this obviously isnt the first time dell has had trouble with faulty hardware from suppliers maybe the company should learn more from the experiences of the sony battery recall and take ownership of these problems even though it wasnt dell who caused the faulty hardware in the first place it is a sad day for dell when a customer cant have confidence in what the company sells them no matter the benefits in initial cost for a system both the customer and the company lose but the comapny loses much more it loses said i tried submitting my questions too and still have not heard back from dell said hi folks i have an inspiron 5000 from 02 2000 that first hat the line issue and then completely went black except for flickering pixels in the line i am actually surprised that the problem has been there for such a long time is there any chance that i get a replacement regards said i am located in singapore and my inspirion 510m bought sometime in june july of 2005 developed 2 vertical lines within 2 years of use i believe i am not the only one who has this problem as i have seen other posts on 510m in this blog here previously i am quite disappointed with the quality of dells product and their refusal to acknowledge the problem reflects their service level of their customer support said i have a latitude d420 that has just developed a problem where a single pixel vertical line is showing up about 2 inches from right side of display i see that dell are acknowledging issues with 17
1994597 oh yeah sorry there was a problem with the 510m but you should have let us know sooner
1994598 the lcd in question was not part of the bad batch of parts
1994599 mauricio i think we both know why you dont have your machine
1994600 but sir your model is not on our list of affected systems
1994601 in the time since then we have found that there are other systems that are potentially affected blah blah blah we have confirmed that the component in question was not used on any other dell notebook lcds
1994602 the inspiron 510m is not on our list of affected systems
1994603 the specific lcd on my 9300 is allegedly not a covered part
1994604 well you can either take my advice or speak with customer service
1994605 so you need us to ship you out a replacement
1994606 this is a known issue for certain models and replacement is covered by dell you do have the same model laptop as the one identified in the issue but the problematic part isnt in your specific laptop youll have to pay for a new display
1994607 if you face this verticle line issue your option is to buy another screen not our problem we wont help you
1994608 im sorry sir the decision is that we dell will not be able to replace your lcd because dell has determined that it is not defective of course once again consumer affairs in texas does not have a phone number where one can reach their us headquarters

1994624 for too long artists have been treated unfairly by the tax code and our nations nonprofit arts institutions are suffering because of it
1994625 artists voice protest against art tariff declare in a public meeting they want no protection ridicule the tax idea
1994626 in having a tariff of 20 per cent on works of art russia admits works of art free turkey charges 8 per cent and the fiji island only 12 1 2 per cent
1994627 to the honor of the american artists it may be said
1994628 that they disapprove of this tax they have fought against the protection they do not want and taken money from their pockets for the work but their time is too precious and this is work for us to do a congressman said recently that the tax was just because it was upon a luxury it is classed with liquor tobacco diamons ostrich feathers silks and laces do these things rank in the same class with a sistine madonna
1994629 there is a blush on all our faces at this tax
1994630 and it is our work to make this blush extend to the men of congress and to make it the blush that wont come off until the tax does our artists are not manufacturers the congressmen say they will not lift the tax from a luxury of the rich until they lift it from the necessities of the poor i maintain that art is a necessity for all the museums may be said to be the residuary legatees of most of the great art collectors if the people want art they must have it and free art means more art for all the people

1994642 the focus on innovation in education and not just about the tools was right on target

1994695 is she a human or is she a replicator shes both and thats what is interesting about this episode
1994696 i watched episodes with her and studied the way that she was and the way that she spoke but mostly i focused on the way that she thought and the way that she approaches situations because shes all about diplomacy shes very intelligent shes not a wimp in any way so i really tried to grasp the way that she approached situations and the way that she would talk to people in these high stakes situations
1994697 theyre complex theyre self aware they are trying to ascend
1994698 they are a race so to wipe them out there are definitely ethical questions there but at the same time they are an enemy and a threat so you have to look out for your own as well which is exactly what this episode is about

1994758 mr mccain has beat mr obamas channel for seven straight days and 11 of the past 14 days in a signal he intends to compete for the youtube vote
1994759 that not only in that mccain ad were there two underdressed blondes mixed with the black guy in the ad but there are also images of the leaning tower of pisa the washington monument and the victory column in berlin as bob herbert put it

1994780 stephanopoulos a gentleman named william ayers he was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that can you explain your relationship to him for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
1994781 in may when a mccain adviser proposed a series of pre convention appearances at town hall meetings obama said i think thats a great idea obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
1994782 there is an image right there in that very beginning of the leaning tower of pisa and there is an image of the washington monument

1994787 what we need today is an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones we need to reduce the tax burden on businesses that choose to make their home in the united states of america we need to open new markets to u s products and we need to reduce the cost of healthcare and we need to end the out of control spending in washington that is putting our debt on the backs of our children
1994788 indicates his party is seriously considering another shutdown threat to force a vote on offshore oil drilling in september
1994789 the precise maneuvering of a shutdown threat is complicated but it revolves around the fact that key government spending bills expire when the fiscal year ends september 30 and congress must vote next month to keep the government operating
1994790 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
1994791 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1994792 in the western world journalists can mostly say what they want as long as they agree with the positions of their publishers

1994797 it is unlikely a running mate will be selected before the candidate returns from a weeks holiday in hawaii which starts this friday that leaves about 10 days until the start of the democratic party convention in denver

1994799 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
1994800 one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain mr
1994801 behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 obama bundlers fund raisers who have each collected contributions totaling 50 000 or more many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington nearly three dozen of the bundlers have raised more than 500 000 each including more than a half dozen who have passed the 1 million mark and one or two who have exceeded 2 million according to interviews with fund raisers
1994802 i firmly disagree that a racial reading of chozicks story is ridiculous and i would counter that any failure on chozicks part to recognize such is just a wee bit clueless
1994803 if youve got michelle as first lady and malia and sasha running around on the south lawn that changes how america looks at itself
1994804 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1994805 if barack obama draws bigger crowds lets have more obama coverage
1994806 the current outsized attention obamas getting notably the three tv networks anchoring their news coverage from his recent international tour seems a market savvy response to audience interest
1994807 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions

1994814 my status has not changed although in a technical way it has i am on call to the editor of the post when they deem that they need reporting and editing from me
1994815 obviously were not the first newspaper to be affected by the continuing downturn in advertising
1994816 we are hopeful that by opting for our employees to voluntarily sign up for buyouts we can avoid any type of layoffs going forward
1994817 the position has been a very valuable part of the newspaper but i felt the need to move the resource to another area i didnt think we should weaken the editorial voice of the newspaper

1994823 back in the 1990s your incomes grew by 6 000 and over the last several years theyve actually fallen by nearly 1 000
1994824 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1994825 a well designed mechanism can impose a fee on a small share of these windfall profits without affecting incentives for oil companies and without affecting the price of oil barack obama will require oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to provide direct relief worth 500 for an individual and 1 000 for a married couple
1994826 the truth is that mccains campaign has received 1 33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry not 2 million
1994827 we find the 2 million figure is based on a mistaken calculation
1994828 cheney has not sought a speaking slot at the convention nor has his staff sought a role for him at the convention

1994838 gee i wonder why if you have a black man running for high public office say barack obama or harold ford the opposition feels compelled to run low life political ads featuring tacky sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates
1994839 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign a complete waste of the countrys time and attention and a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1994840 according to data from the google adwords website advertisements targeted to users searching for john mccain on the internet cost nearly twice as much as those targeting users searching for barack obama
1994841 whats more google predicts that the term barack obama will generate 153 to 191 clicks per day on related advertisements but john mccain does much better as advertiser bait google estimates that those ads get 213 to 266 clicks per day

1994855 it seems fair to hypothesize that ap as structured today wont be in the position to pick up the slack as newspaper staffs are thinned

1994866 what we certainly will look into is the equation of car set up tyres and track conditions if you look at roberts qualifying time he should have been able to fight at the front but in reality in certain phases of the race he was the slowest car on the track what happened in the race was completely unexpected

1994888 another case of a blogger breaking a story and establishment media following up on it
1994889 on the subject of spins of omission cjr doesnt have much room to talk given the glaring sin of omission at cjr that blogger david m uncovered last week
1994890 excuse me am i hallucinating or has a blog the
1994891 david m has done a thorough fisking of this definition of fisking
1994892 david m on the other hand is not entirely convinced
1994893 david m provides one more reason to be glad that we wont be swearing in a president kerry tomorrow
1994894 you gotta admire a guy wholl stick it to the media and the universities in one fell swoop
1994895 i admit that i have been under much influence of militant free tibet organisations back home
1994896 the western stereotype about china is that everything happens there or originates from china must be the result of government manipulation
1994897 if this understanding was somewhat accurate 30 years ago its validity has decreased ever since and even becomes utterly misleading if not laughable nowadays
1994898 not a natural ally of the cpc communist party of china government
1994899 in many aspects they are more aggressive assertive and action oriented than the government
1994900 a lot of these characteristics can be attributed to the demographic features of this group of people young energetic ultra confident and most important technology savvy they utilise the internet and online technology as their communication centre organisation platform and execution vehicle to extend their cause most of the times far ahead of the governments response cycle
1994901 the resurging trend of individual cyber attacks or at least based on the accusations from western governments is largely carried out by a new group or new generation of youngsters who view the cpc government as too weak and too soft toward foreign pressure or insults and take justice in their own hands
1994902 there are all sorts of shades of grey for example service providers can provide information to users but not news
1994903 absolutely the greatest filter between china and the rest of the world is language 90 of all communication on the internet is within china because of the language barriers
1994904 i admit that i have been under much influence of militant free tibet organisations back home what china is doing now and what china has done are so different and i am angry with myself for not realising the distinction before now
1994905 this certainly sounds unlike anything lucy would have written i saw the original and i certainly have no memory of anything like that figuring in it it doesnt sound like her phraseology she read classics she writes beautifully and this doesnt sound at all like her style quite apart from her sentiments i would imagine its been done today students for a free tibet have in the past had tampering with their own internal emails
1994906 we could feel the atmosphere of oppression just walking through the streets and monasteries our guide was hushed by a monk when he uttered 14th dalai lama and guiltily giggled as he mentioned the official 11th panchen lama the 2nd most important leader in tibet before china who is a chinese replacement for the real panchen lama who has been in prison since his recognition at the age of 6
1994907 even so monks are not being tortured on the streets as the impression is given and in fact just seem to get on with their business within their monasteries or walk around the streets seemingly unbothered the chinese maintains sic an impressive presence and there is still a large amount of han immigration which is sad but nothing to the extent that is advertised at home
1994908 it is something that we are pretty used to i am just surprised that they didnt take it down instead of trying to misrepresent her views
1994909 there will certainly be people of conscience who will try to speak out in peaceful ways while the world spotlight is on china
1994910 we have done this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool to whitewash their human rights
1994911 as far as we know foreigners gathered illegally and we express our strong opposition to that
1994912 we will resist all attempts to politicise the olympics we have laws regarding assembly and demonstrations and we hope that foreigners will respect the laws of china
1994913 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists we speak out not to antagonise chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential

1994928 mountainridge and pinecastle are going to be kept separate mountainridge music marketing is not being set up as a stepping stone to pinecastle records we are simply providing another tool for bluegrass artists
1994929 at the moment and at this level there is no movement within opec to do anything
1994930 i dont think ministers will change output i think at less than 80 for opec oil maybe they would do something
1994931 of course web version hints at the problem because most editorial workflows are still built around print publishing and so are blind to all of the web value being figuratively left on the cutting room floor or literally tossed in the trash

1994936 nuclear weapons were created by humans and it is our responsibility to eliminate them before they eliminate us
1994937 there is much we still dont know about the candidates positions
1994938 both state in general terms that they favor the goal of a nuclear weapons free world neither of them however has discussed seeking to achieve a nuclear weapons convention a treaty that would set forth a roadmap for the phased verifiable irreversible and transparent elimination of nuclear weapons
1994939 between the two candidates senator mccains positions seem more cautious and sketchy
1994940 obama has come out in favor of removing u s nuclear weapons from hair trigger alert not developing new nuclear weapons ratifying the comprehensive test ban treaty and achieving a verifiable global ban on the production of new nuclear weapons material
1994941 well have major progress on nuclear issues no matter who is elected
1994942 it debunks the common view that obama is the most liberal democratic senator and it debunks the view that mccain is really the third bush term
1994943 adds significantly to the complications of controlling nuclear materials and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons
1994944 obama also focuses much more on securing loose unsafe nuclear materials
1994945 both mccain and obama represent a departure from the status quo
1994946 acknowledges the unacceptable risks nuclear weapons pose merely by their existence
1994947 at the end of the day what really matters is how each one would respond to a crisis situation
1994948 while both candidates appear to take nuclear proliferation seriously the difference in their worldview is of utmost importance
1994949 the only sure way to prevent nuclear terrorism is to rid the world of nuclear weapons
1994950 in the seventh decade of the nuclear age there is a glimmer of hope that new leadership in the united states may pave the way forward toward a world free of nuclear weapons
1994951 if we get the deal put together it will significantly reduce the cost

1994991 despite good fundamentals we have been unable to insulate ourselves from sector developments indeed the second quarter was clearly weaker than the previous year the latter part of the year also seems difficult and the operational result for the second half of the year might dip into the red
1994992 high fuel prices and a trend towards lower ticket prices have been unsettling developments for airlines the overcapacity in the market has not allowed ticket prices to rise in parallel with costs the coming cost cutting programmes in the sector will be so severe that in countries where airlines collapse there may be demands for flight connections to be maintained for business needs using state funds
1994993 the situation in the sector may remain extremely difficult due to expensive fuel and uncertain development of demand in the second half of the year fuel costs are expected to account for around 28 per cent of finnairs turnover whereas last year the jet fuel bill accounted for a fifth of turnover

1995019 i hope you hang yourself with your h amp m scarf while jacking off listening to mozart
1995020 theyre not seriously homophobic but they can be read as implicitly demeaning gay people i am sure katy would get a critical reception if she expressed comparable sentiments in a song called ur so black jewish or disabled should there be different standards for lyrics about gay issues as opposed to race and disability issues i dont think so having said this the homophobia of some reggae rap and ragga music is far worse some of these songs explicitly incite the murder of lesbians and gays they are much more offensive than any lyrics sung by katy perry

1995048 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border

1995406 this data was not lost by the bbc itself but stolen from an independent production company working for cbbc however we took the issue very seriously there is absolutely no evidence this data has been misused and the measures we took were entirely precautionary
1995407 in the weeks since this happened cbbc suspended new commissions and carried out a comprehensive review of practices and we are now satisfied security of data is strong enough for production to resume

1995422 communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly
1995423 communities of practice do not usually require heavy institutional infrastructures but their members do need time and space to collaborate they do not require much management but they can use leadership they self organize but they flourish when their learning fits with their organizational environment the art is to help such communities find resources and connections without overwhelming them with organizational meddling this need for balance reflects the following paradox no community can fully design the learning of another but conversely no community can fully design its own learning
1995424 please give us three communities of practice by june 1st

1995475 the main feature request from users was the ability to not just speak to twitter but also to listen to their friends twitter messages via their phone so im very pleased that twitterfone now enables two and multi way conversations on twitter using any phone while youre on the move
1995476 weve received a huge amount of feedback from our hyper enthused users and we hope to provide them with what they want and well be seeking some outside funding to do this twitterfone has become something much more than the proof of concept we initially launched

1995479 a couple of days ago i came back to sao paulo i tried to forget the race at budapest but thats quite difficult
1995480 although i dont want to forget the hungarian gp because in a certain way it was one of the best races i ever had in formula 1 but it didnt end as the others with a win it was a shame because i really think that me and the team deserved the success we had a perfect race at a very important moment of the championship unfortunately we couldnt bring home the ten points we already had in our hands it was really frustrating but these things sometimes happen in motor sports
1995481 it was like a nightmare and i wanted to wake up but i couldnt because i was already awake it was an incredible disappointment this sport can be really cruel
1995482 looking at the standigs at least i can stay calm because not even lewis won but we cant throw away points like that
1995483 we lost ten but the positive aspect is that weve demonstrated that were strong the team has done some great work over the whole weekend in terms of strategy and eliminating the problems we had in england and germany
1995484 they couldnt keep him so they put an ad in the paper looking for someone to take him in as an exchange student so my mother took him in she had done that before

1995507 its important that defence pursues further opportunities which will enable students to get a taste of military life and the benefits of a career in the adf this also complements other youth orientated schemes such as the defence gap year program cadets and the work experience program which is currently under development

1995522 because mtdna is inherited without recombination and because the neandertal mtdna falls outside the variation of modern human mtdna this single modern human observation represents a reversion to the ancestral state seen in neandertals and chimpanzees thus these four amino acid substitutions occurred in the relatively short period after the divergence of neandertal and extant human mtdnas and before the most recent common ancestor of current human mtdnas the observation of four nonsynonymous substitutions on the modern human lineage and no amino acid changes on the neandertal lineage stands in contrast to the overall trend of more nonsynonymous evolution in neandertal protein coding genes and deserves consideration

1995533 the grant from mozilla is based on the strength of the work that we have done in the past and the tools that we have released to users
1995534 we awarded the grant because mozilla and translates missions are very well aligned as both organizations are motivated by promoting openness and opportunity on the internet
1995535 we hope that our support will help amplify the impact they are having in so many translation communities
1995536 one of our objectives with the grant is to make the tools more accessible to users
1995537 we want to limit the amount of technical knowledge users need to use the tools so that they can be used by more users

1995554 when musician producer and invisible records label owner martin atkins visited beijing in the fall of 2006 he had no idea what to expect

1995557 did hosting the olympics promote the rights of people in china
1995558 not at all said xiao nong cheng executive director of the center for modern china a think tank in princeton n j this olympics is bad and chinas people have lost even the smallest right to talk
1995559 cheng pointed out that in the run up to the olympics china terrified at losing face on the world stage suppressed its citizens even more than usual and that indications to the contrary such as a recent pew survey are merely lies
1995560 the pew ignored a basic fact that surveys in china according to official regulations have to be approved and all the data filtered said cheng
1995561 cheng added that the world media rather than turn a spotlight onto china is instead muzzling itself in order to cover the games

1995568 you wouldnt buy a pair of shoes without trying them on so why would you get married without trying it on
1995569 only two out of ten cohabiting couples are able to build a lasting marriage
1995570 nearly half of cohabiting couples break up before the wedding their premarital divorce frequently is no less painful than divorce itself
1995571 those cohabiting couples who do marry are 50 percent more likely to divorce than those who never lived together
1995572 how do we encourage the kinds of attitudes among the young that are supportive of successful marriage and adverse to cohabitation
1995573 perhaps the only solution is that people who believe in traditional morality should be as outspoken and brazen about their moral views as the other side is brazen about their immoral ones

1995588 in the current situation of high commodity prices and low stocks we have been saying we have the science to help address this incredible demand for agricultural commodities
1995589 im very excited to announce today we will deliver a step change improvement in soybean yields in unprecedented volumes for the 2009 growing season
1995590 with the y series yield advantage this new line has the potential to add about 19 million bushels of soybeans into u s production
1995591 one of the most important traits to a grower when selecting new products for their farm is yield and higher yields have never been more important to the ag economy and to the world than they are today
1995592 the entire y series class has shown a 5 percent yield advantage over key competitors in more than 1 800 on farm comparisons with some of them yielding as much as 10 percent better than these key competitors
1995593 pioneer has been a leader in the use of molecular technology since the mid 1990s
1995594 historically weve developed molecular markers for traits such as resistance to soybean cyst nematode phytophthora root rot and brown stem rot
1995595 but one of the new breakthroughs in recent years is developing molecular markers that actually track genes that can enhance yield performance per se unlike genes for pest resistance that are controlled by one or two genes yield is controlled by many genes working in combination so its difficult to do it by just looking at yield data and determining which gene is causing yield enhancement
1995596 after we ran the analysis comparing the current elite varieties with their ancestors we wound up with a little over 100 genes that we focused on as potential yield enhancers then we started testing those genes one by one to see if they had yield enhancing properties
1995597 we have a goal at pioneer of increasing soybean productivity by nearly 40 percent over the next 10 years to meet the growing demand for soybeans used for food for feed and for fuel
1995598 the decisions nice has to make are some of the hardest in public life
1995599 nhs resources are not limitless and nice has to decide what treatments represent best value to the patient as well as the nhs
1995600 although these treatments are clinically effective regrettably the cost to the nhs is such that they are not a cost effective use of nhs resources
1995601 two of the manufacturers have developed proposals which may have the effect of reducing the cost of the drugs
1995602 we will be happy to consider these proposals once they have been reviewed and considered suitable for the nhs by the department of health
1995603 the way that pharmaceutical companies are charging the nhs for drugs
1995604 whether appropriate allowances are being made by nice to compensate for the lack of large scale trials in these areas
1995605 we are disappointed at nices view that although these drugs are clinically effective their high price means that they are not considered to be value for money for the nhs
1995606 these drugs have shown a small but definite improvement in an illness where there are few alternative treatments

1995614 poncho 500 offers corn growers improved control of wireworm black cutworm and other insects improved insect control contributes to higher yields as compared to poncho 250
1995615 with the higher cost of seed it pays to invest in a seed treatment
1995616 with poncho 500 youll see an excellent return on your investment with top notch protection and higher yields
1995617 with poncho 500 adding more active ingredient only makes the control better
1995618 the need to protect seed corn investments is as important as ever to growers so making the decision to use poncho 500 is an easy one
1995619 with 4 corn growers who use poncho 500 can see an average 10 bushel per acre increase in their yields over the fungicide control and thats money in their pockets
1995620 talk about the sound system all day but you have to feel it
1995621 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008
1995622 we asked the ioc to further investigate this element via their medical commission and we are waiting for their feedback about whether they think there is a risk to health and then wada will be in a position to re open the dossier and to decide whether there are grounds for a ban or not
1995623 both reactionary religion and militant secularism are on the rise with both displaying a rigid certainty and a desire for power that will do nothing to benefit society in this context it is vital that people with open minded faith speak up and demonstrate alternatives altmuslim com has set many good examples in this regard
1995624 you see more hostility towards muslims now than you did the year after 9 11

1995639 understanding and minimizing quality deterioration is critical for manufacturers as it is a key driver of owner satisfaction and word of mouth recommendations
1995640 it is imperative that manufacturers design models that not only achieve high levels of initial quality but also attain high levels of longer term dependability vehicle models that stand the test of time will help automaker profitability through superior owner satisfaction and recommendation rates
1995641 although automakers have achieved tremendous gains in initial quality and dependability in recent years by specifically addressing customer concerns these particular problems still prove challenging for manufacturers
1995642 the fact that these problems have endured throughout the industry for many years suggests that additional focus on these issues prior to vehicle launch would benefit not only consumers but also automakers through increased customer satisfaction
1995643 the gains in dependability for compact and midsize vehicles are good news for consumers who are downsizing their vehicles due to increasing fuel prices
1995644 consumers who purchase these smaller vehicles benefit not only from immediate gains in fuel economy but also from improvements in long term dependability compared with previous years

1995648 for all the governments attempts to paint the commissions as another nuremberg they remain utterly outside the law and will be mired in challenges for years to come
1995649 hamdan was convicted based on laws that were passed long after he was picked up and the commission allowed coerced evidence both illegal under not only international law but u s law as well
1995650 hamdans trial revealed what is common knowledge the military commissions are fatally flawed and do not adhere to major aspects of the rule of law hamdan suffered nearly seven years of unlawful detention only to face a process that falls far short so far the trial continues the bush administrations efforts to escape the rule of law and the requirements of justice
1995651 the trial was a show trial the rules of evidence are so tilted in the governments favour that the tribunal is ill designed for getting at truth
1995652 its hard to credit any verdict though its telling that the executive failed to win the entire case even in its contrived system
1995653 that however in no way proves the system is fair or that it works
1995654 this is an enormously compelling indication of how independent the process has been
1995655 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
1995656 the power to proceed because its structures and procedures violate both the uniform code of military justice and the four geneva conventions signed in 1949
1995657 i would guess that its one of the most sophisticated ai systems out there
1995658 200 or 300 of these experiences laid back to back and you can make a game out of that
1995659 the thing that bears stating is that every one of these steps has their own associated pleasures and rewards
1995660 a lot of the ai is specifically designed to address one or the other of these phases
1995661 theyre the ones that are played with our reptilian brains the idea was for the ai to play them back with you
1995662 part of that recipe demands that at some point you have a safe zone
1995663 in a sense we needed to make the ai territorial once you have this idea you have to think about the problem of encounter progression as the player expands their safe zone that itself is a pretty fun process it gives the player a sense of progress and is extremely plannable
1995664 if ai are given a territory they are supposed to occupy its very possible for a player to walk into a space and know that if he will open fire the whole room of enemies isnt going to come crashing down on him based on the distribution of enemies across it
1995665 we recapitulated this system many times in halo 2 and 3 and formalized it with deeper topologies
1995666 each ai has an internal model of each target and that model can be wrong
1995667 this allows the ai to be surprised by you and this is very fun
1995668 its more fun to kill an enemy thats cunning formidable and tactical
1995669 they have to let the player know that his presence is important to them one way or the other and they have to make the player understand how his actions affect them
1995670 they have to be roughly player equivalent in terms of capabilities which doesnt mean that were making bots but they must be able to use and board all the vehicles and use all the weapons
1995671 i sometimes forget this when i play halo 1 but all of the crates are static
1995672 by the time weve reached halo 2 all of the creates are exploding and moving everywhere and that created a terrible problem for our pathfinding all of this is great with me however because i believe that more is better when it comes to ai the more things that you have to react to the more things you can do and the more ai seems to have common sense
1995673 if im an ai and the player drives up to me which seat do i get in this is actually quite a difficult proposition because if im carrying a rocket launcher i should really get in the passenger seat so i can use it when we tip over what do i do do i just walk off or do i stick around and wait for the player to right it and what does sticking around even mean because i should be doing all my normal behaviors taking cover fighting
1995674 we run up against the problem of a lack of telepathy all the time
1995675 in halo 2 if an ai tips over his vehicle he walks off and forgets completely he was ever in one
1995676 in halo 3 if he tips it he remains in its vicinity fighting until there is a point where he can right it again
1995677 behavior should be a very thin layer on top of a world of concepts
1995678 im out of luck if i want to make a game that involves picking a pencil up
1995679 the problem is not that mistakes are made but there are no ways to correct it
1995680 i have no way of saying no try again what i want is a youre doing it wrong button but i dont want to give them orders i want to have a conversation
1995681 the ultimate tragedy for the ai programmer is that this is not an ai problem but a design problem

1995821 hi dominick deeper investigation on my part into what i suspected was a bug turned out to be by design the scenario you are attempting upgrading a legacy app that depends on the wcf claims model is not supported in zermatt once you opt into zermatts claims model the wcf claims api does not work anymore the reason for this behavior is the new claims model in zermatt is not backwards compatible with the wcf claims api and it is not feasible to support both the old and new models at the same time for wcf applications as you have called out earlier in a separate discussion you have to choose between staying with the wcf api and not use zermatt or move your application to zermatt if you do choose to migrate any code that depends on the wcf claims api will need to be rewritten

1996000 we feel theres a serious intention by the american forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least
1996001 it should not be considered an end to the mehdi army but its a halfway step to dissolving the mehdi army if the u s began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution

1996008 those models being france and germany the two countries most responsible for the greatest human carnage during the 20th century

1996037 nobody can do science by a committee you do science by testing
1996038 to me it is appalling that an international organization of the stature of the u n would ignore the evidence of past climate changing
1996039 it has been a tough year for the high priests of global warming in the us first nasa had to correct its earlier claim that the hottest year on record in the contiguous us had been 1998 which seemed to prove that global warming was on the march it was actually 1934 then it turned out the worlds oceans have been growing steadily cooler not hotter since 2003 meanwhile the winter of 2007 was the coldest in the us in decades after al gore warned us that we were about to see the end of winter as we know it yet believers in man made global warming demand more and more money to combat climate change and still more drastic changes in our economic output and lifestyle the reason is that precisely that they are believers not scientists no amount of empirical evidence will overturn what has become not a scientific theory but a form of religion of superstition and enthusiasm describes how even in civilised societies the mind of man is subject to certain unaccountable terrors and apprehensions when real worries are missing as these enemies are entirely invisible and unknown like todays greenhouse gases people try to propitiate them by ceremonies observations mortifications sacrifices such as earth day and banning plastic bags and petrol driven lawnmowers fear and ignorance hume concludes are the true source of superstition they lead a blind and terrified public to embrace any practice however absurd or frivolous which either folly or knavery recommends
1996040 the scientific consensus is so strong and so universal there are just a handful of doubters on this
1996041 yet those doubters get such high media attention and a lot of support

1996044 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
1996045 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
1996046 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
1996047 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
1996048 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

1996096 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
1996097 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
1996098 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
1996099 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
1996100 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system

1996108 i want madison to know i did everything i could to get her back
1996109 i can understand why some fathers give up trying to get custody or even seeing their children its like nothing ive ever experienced
1996110 every time im shopping i see things shed like and i buy them little snacks books stickers she loves stickers
1996111 you cant talk about personality conflicts in a team meeting like that
1996112 talk about turning stomachs upside down my stomach would be the worst
1996113 alicia consider this in your team meeting if every persons stomach is churning queasy is it possible that at that moment the group is dealing with a real issue
1996114 and do you think its possible that until that real issue gets solved that no other productive work can be accomplished by the team
1996115 i would like to apologise one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
1996116 the effect has been that this jury of six military officers bought the arguments of the defence rather than the arguments of their own government as to how severe a threat he was and the severity of his crimes
1996117 i hope the day comes when you return to your wife and your daughters and your country
1996118 at that time he will still be considered an enemy combatant but he will be eligible for review by an administrative review board
1996119 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
1996120 a consequence so great that others will think again before they ally themselves with osama bin laden or the next osama bin laden
1996121 its not going to happen in may random house abruptly called off publication of the book the series of events that torpedoed this novel are a window into how quickly fear stunts intelligent discourse about the muslim world
1996122 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
1996123 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
1996124 politics gender and the islamic past the legacy of aisha bint abi bakr
1996125 just got a frantic call from a professor who got an advance copy of the forthcoming novel jewel of medina she said she found it incredibly offensive
1996126 upcoming book jewel of medina a new attempt to slander the prophet of islam
1996127 the writer withdraws this book from the stores and apologise all the muslims across the world
1996128 its very hard to predict right now when and if well need more capital
1996129 future losses can change that assumption and were obviously dependent on the condition of the u s housing market
1996130 the houses of the arabs who lived there until 1948 are not mentioned
1996131 they came at night to steal fruit from the orchards and go back to gaza laden with loot
1996132 would there have been one job in his history that hes left that he didnt leave in a complete shambles
1996133 if barack obama wins well get our taxes raised wrong to do with a struggling economy worst thing you can do is take money from the private sector and give it to the government on john mccain mccain is just four more years of the failed policies of george bush failed foreign policies and no investments in the countrys infrastructure as jerry garcia used to say if youre picking the lesser of two evils youre still picking evil im not saying theyre evil men im just saying both men are wrong for the country right now
1996134 the reason we dont have solar power like we should is they havent figured out how to put a meter on it once they figure out how to put a meter on it and give a cut to the government i figure they will push mush harder on it
1996135 first of all he hasnt been a minnesotan for 30 years he hasnt paid taxes in minnesota for 30 years so from my perspective hes a carpetbagger whos coming here to run for his own aspirations why didnt he run in the state where he was living if he loses do you think hell remain living in minnesota
1996136 is america ready for a black president absolutely it has been for some time we probably would have had one by now if the black community had ever supported a conservative the way they are now supporting one of the most liberal more than likely the first black president will be a republican on august 5 the new york young republican club had a fund raiser in manhattan for colonel allen west who is running for congress the irony is that colonel west is running for congress in florida and therefore has a chance the black community in new york only supports democrats i followed the link to his campaign site allenwestforcongress com and read his superb bio colonel west has a b s and m s in political science spent 22 years in the military and won a bronze star three meritorious service medals three army commendation medals one with valor and yes hes black the best recommendation for his candidacy may be that keith olbermann put him on his worst person in the world list here in staten island the democratic party has never had a black as a local candidate republicans had al curtis and terry player run for local new york offices in 2002 but the black community supported the white democrats instead of two very fine candidates so that staten islands record for having only elected white candidates still stands
1996137 new york is not the only state that dooms black conservatives in 2006 michael steele the former lieutenant governor of maryland and a man many republicans would support for president ran for the u s senate and almost won he managed to win the support of prominent blacks such as russell simmons and michael mfume he even had a group called democrats for steele organize large turnouts at events mr steele almost won against benjamin cardin until parkinsons sufferer michael j fox came to town and played the sympathy card falsely alleging that mr steele was against stem cell research to this day many voters still do not understand the difference between embryonic and adult stem cell research had mr steele had the full support of his community this tactic would not have succeeded but as usual many blacks still vote straight down the democratic ticket one would think that a hall of fame football star such as lynn swann would have aced his run for pennsylvania governor but once again he lost because he ran as a republican
1996138 the blacks who have attained the strongest national leadership roles have been republicans the first black secretary of state colin powell and the first black female secretary of state condoleezza rice republicans have been ready for a black president since lincoln

1996145 this is an enormous waste of law enforcement resources that should be focused on violent and serious crime
1996146 with alcohol we acknowledge the distinction between use and abuse and we focus our law enforcement on efforts to stop irresponsible use we do not arrest or jail responsible drinkers that should be our policy for marijuana as well

1996156 much of british colonial africa was transformed during the colonial period in the gold coast there were about 3000 children at school in the early 1900s whereas in the mid 1950s there were over half a million in the early 1890s there were in the gold coast no railways or roads but only a few jungle paths
1996157 foreign private organizations and persons under the comparative security of colonial rule and usually in the face of formidable obstacles
1996158 in british west africa public security and health improved out of all recognition peaceful travel became possible slavery and slave trading and famine were practically eliminated and the incidence of the worst diseases reduced
1996159 for many including some africans the statute of limitation on colonialism as an explanation for underdevelopment lapsed long ago moreover four former colonies two british hong kong and singapore and two japanese south korea and taiwan have vaulted into the first world

1996173 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
1996174 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
1996175 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

1996179 we are happy to share with the world in these joyful moments but i am sad to see the big teams of many countries while our country is left behind with one of the smallest teams in the olympics
1996180 we had hoped that our country will participate with a large team in order to get good results in the games our interest in the olympics would have been greater
1996181 anyhow i will try not to miss the events they are in
1996182 we have waiting eagerly for this world event in iraq we are in desperate need for such issues in order to entertain ourselves and forget the miseries

1996192 if this is the quality of the advice offered any graduate should think twice about taking it and they should question whose interests are being represented
1996193 any employer worth its salt should be open and transparent about the salary of the position on offer of course graduates should do their homework and the salary on offer is a mark of that
1996194 salary for most people including graduates is critical in the decision making process
1996195 given the level of debt the majority of graduates have as they enter the jobs market they need to know how much the job pays i think to attend an interview as a graduate and mnot know or ask about the salary is naive
1996196 starting salaries for it graduates tend to be about 18 000 to 22 000 it is not right to ask about salary when attending an interview because in this competitive market employers are constantly comparing and contrasting what they spend on graduates
1996197 candidates who want to maximise their opportunity to land their ideal position should consider that asking about salary particularly early on could mean that they are not looked upon as favourably as other candidates who do not touch on the subject
1996198 correct that if they were outside the amount they would pay
1996199 there will always be salaries that are slightly higher or slightly lower than the average but we are trying to assist graduates to understand what kind of salary is generally on offer it is very important for graduates to know that companies particularly the larger ones have strong progression plans in place
1996200 in a first interview steer clear of salary questions but graduates applying to less established graduate recruiters need to be aware of their worth
1996201 sometimes in an interview situation if you like the job there can be a tendency to undersell yourself do your research and be realistic as to where you fit
1996202 in many ways i didnt want to portray a crazy person i wanted to get to really understand the reality that she lives in the one that she defends

1996209 the sentence comes after changes to the murder laws in england and wales were announced last week which will mean that husbands who kill nagging wives will no longer be able to claim they were provoked

1996214 we need to apply punishments against these things in order for nissan to keep its interests in the region it must apologize
1996215 as far as i know the drinking of tea from the tea plant is verboten
1996216 only a lawyer could stretch tea leaves from the same plant fermented for different lengths of time not notice processed in different ways to be
1996217 additionally previous usage is a pretty handy guide to what was meant
1996218 introducing new designations for those teas doesnt change that distinction
1996219 well it isnt hot and it isnt a drink so it should be okay
1996220 you cant expect all religious beliefs to make sense or else youd never manage to be a part of any religion

1996233 democratic aides working on plan to keep the peace at the convention
1996234 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
1996235 theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
1996236 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back
1996237 he is an arrogant politician that thinks he is already the president
1996238 the decision of which and how many villages should be included in the moro peoples territorial claims should not solely be at the hands of president gloria macapagal arroyo or be limited at the negotiating table of the grp milf peace talks

1996240 on the other hand the higher relative inflation this implies will make it more difficult to improve net exports in spain
1996241 its an example of a number of computer systems in which the state made a large investment decades ago and has been keeping it going the last few years with duct tape
1996242 pragmatically we just cant get the system to work in a timely manner for us to implement payment of minimum wage
1996243 we have not been provided with the evidence that would show us that this is an impossibility nor does it answer the question of why arent we working on this for next time
1996244 the point is the law needs to be adhered to and the governor is saying we need to follow the law and if the controller is saying its inconvenient i think the controller needs to explain why inconvenience is a reason to ignore the law
1996245 its certainly not a language that is taught oftentimes you have to rely on retired annuitants to come back and help maintain the system until youre able to find a replacement
1996246 there is no excuse for the legislatures failure to reach a compromise and to send me a budget

1996278 there is a new atlas sound album almost completely finished

1996281 i believe the faster you rise the faster you fall
1996282 we wanted to make a solid album great songs with hooks and attitude
1996283 we didn t want a standard pop arrangement we wanted to do something different
1996284 at the time we thought it was one of our best songs so we sent it around to whoever we could think of then one day we re at rehearsal and it s john and he tells us that he loves the song and loves our sound and wants to hear more it was fucking crazy
1996285 i think it s cool that kids are picking up on our music and digging it and maybe thinking who the hell are the clash who are the police and the jam and joe jackson and squeeze and elvis costello
1996286 his music changed my life and made such a huge impact on my songs and songwriting from him i learned that the songs have got to stand out and there has to be attitude and character you ve got to hear the singer and know who it is right away
1996287 at first we thought about leaving that off the album
1996288 and we thought maybe we should keep it uptempo like the classic punk records or like nevermind or dookie but then we just thought fuck it we cannot deny a good song
1996289 it s exciting but it s a little hard to comprehend
1996290 being from the u k every day we re in the states we re like holy shit how did we get here

1996294 i spoke up against the administration and congress and senator obama when they gave us an energy bill with more than giveaways to big oil and really no solution to our energy problems
1996295 i want to take a minute here on this issue cause i think senator obama might be a little bit confused yesterday he accused me of having president bushs policies on energy thats odd because he voted for the presidents energy bill and i voted against it
1996296 it had 2 8 billion in corporate welfare to big oil companies and theyre already making record profits as you know
1996297 senator obama voted for that bill and its big oil giveaways i know he hasnt been in the senate that long but even in the real world voting for something voting for something means your support and voting against something means you oppose it
1996298 he actually thinks that raising taxes on oil is gonna bring down the price at the pump
1996299 hes claiming that putting air in your tires is the equivalent is the equivalent of new offshore drilling thats not an energy plan my friends thats a public service announcement

1996316 t his is not a catastrophe for online poker modern programs are not strong at no limit or multi player games secondly it is not difficult to identify a known program if you use the fritz chess program to play chess on an online server it will be obvious to everyone the same applies for poker since using programs is against the poker sites terms of use if you do it you will have your account closed permanently i started the research into poker ai in 1992 and we have had a very large team of excellent researchers working on the problem for many years we have made a lot of progress over the past 16 years but i can assure you the sky is not falling

1996341 if you had invasive breast cancer would you prefer 9 weeks or a full year treatment
1996342 i wonder how long it would take for the government to fully fund herceptain if one of the labour
1996343 we think that most breast cancer patients are young because it is young women who get the media attention in fact the majority are older women in 2002 the latest year for which figures are available only 16 of newly diagnosed women in new zealand were under 40 and most 60 were over 50 around one in four were between 40 and 50 an ideal breast cancer patient for media stardom is young and balding a clear sign of a heroic battle weary warrior

1996356 there are a lot of dealers like us that are doing our best to cover that area if cdw wants to compete then they should do it at their own expense hp should not be subsidizing them to compete with their other dealers
1996357 if hp is paying for this it seems like the hp direct call center operation in another form which we never liked
1996358 it was competing against us i dont think white space really exists
1996359 the only downside i see is cdw traditionally has tried to lead with price and now for accounts that we might be in together it certainly cant help my margins
1996360 were leading with services now and dragging hp along were not as focused on products as we once were as long as we continue the education of customers on service and support i think well be fine
1996361 cdw works with its major partners on sales and marketing programs that we believe will help serve our mutual customers we do not discuss details of these programs as always cdw is here to meet our customers needs and one way we do that is to offer and sell a wide array of products from many manufacturers in the categories we carry

1996374 where u s vulnerabilities may lie and how the united states should think about maintaining its military advantage in the future
1996375 the roman model suggests that it is possible for the united states to maintain its military advantage for centuries if it remains capable of transforming its forces before an opponent can develop counter capabilities transformation coupled with strong strategic institutions is a powerful combination for an adversary to overcome

1996393 violence against women is both a cause and consequence of hiv and aids
1996394 in order to successfully tackle aids we must address violence against women both pandemics are intertwined in a vicious cycle
1996395 first physically the transmission from male to female is 2 5 times more likely than the transmission from a woman to a man
1996396 so already physically speaking we have a situation that will gradually drive the pandemic toward an increasing proportion of women
1996397 now we are coming down to proportions of five men to a woman four men to a woman three men to a woman
1996398 we are down to 1 to 1 so the tendency is totally clear
1996399 globally the percentage of women among people living with hiv has remained stable at 50 percent for several years however womens share of infections is increasing in several countries

1996411 and when you take the two project leaders out of the room you cripple the team from dealing with the problem the next time it happens they will look to you to rescue them
1996412 is your job to make the team comfortable or is your job to grow the team where they can solve increasingly more difficult problems they cannot do that when you solve their problems for them they can only do that when you help them solve their own problems

1996421 penetrating analysis in a lively style on a wide range of issues
1996422 at this point we dont know how far up his ass his head actually is or if we will be able to remove it successfully
1996423 sticking your head up your ass is a fairly common occurrence for politicians
1996424 but it is only safe in moderation you cant breath in there and you need to remove your head every once in a while to get a breath of fresh air at this point the presidents head has been up his ass so long that at minimum he has suffered severe brain damage he might actually be dead at this point and we wouldnt even know it until we get the camera in there to see at this point our only hope is that his head is so far up his ass that he has actually made it up to the trachea and is able to get some air that way while we have never seen someone with their head so far up their asses as to be able to do this it would explain a lot about his policy decisions
1996425 we have seen an epidemic of people with their heads up there ass over the last 5 years
1996426 neither the president or the american people can survive much longer with the presidents head up his ass
1996427 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
1996428 we dont have huge budgets because the show hasnt proven itself yet storyboard artists are being asked to work tighter deadlines and the directors weve got five will swing right over to new episodes when their previous shows have finished animatics
1996429 classical its typically have a somewhat rigid architecture of first i ask a question then i wait for a response then i talk some more then i wait for another response facial expression recognition i believe will allow the feedback from student to teacher to happen while the robot teacher is talking
1996430 the its which have been developed are already better teachers than people who have no experience
1996431 the traditional model of learning is consistently shown as one of the worst ways to teach people its much better for a student to have one on one interaction
1996432 i see textbooks falling away and students having large numbers of software packages
1996433 in time we will see the end of the monopoly of classroom instruction with age segregation we will see many different types of learning environments we can truly close educational achievement gaps through constructive use of the technology
1996434 children in the future will be able to explore and learn about domains at far younger ages and with far greater results through computational approaches they will be able to work with and learn from people around the world through connectivity they will be able to learn without boundaries
1996435 in life not every moment is a learning experience this gives the students ten times more experience compared to traditional methods
1996436 my goal in this research is not to change how people learn but rather to adapt computer and robot interfaces to how people learn im trying to bring the robot teachers to us not the other way around
1996437 the technology is not the most difficult part helping institutions to change and adapt to enable the new possibilities is the most difficult element what is needed is vision and political will
1996438 todays move means that symptom free people diagnosed with chlamydia and their partner will be able to get convenient effective treatment from their local pharmacy

1996451 a man and his cleaver whacking away at lipoidal thinking everywhere
1996452 smb is like pork sausage bad for you ugly to watch being made but too damned tasty to resist

1996454 one hundred and fifty russian tanks armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles have entered south ossetia
1996455 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
1996456 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
1996457 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
1996458 these people live in caves they have no tongues they make guns with their bare hands you cant beat them
1996459 google is saying that aols value has declined permanently and wont recover
1996460 now i have to tell myself what my state is
1996461 the marines gain ground every day and secure more of the routes through the district the support we have received from our allied partners has contributed to our many successes thus far
1996462 the number of fighters that stood and fought is kind of surprising to me but obviously theyre fighting for something
1996463 theyre flowing in guys are going south and picking up arms we have an opportunity to really clear them out cripple them so i think were exploiting the success were finding
1996464 we have seen that they are starting to have trouble reinforcing and getting arms
1996465 because weve seen fighters coming in from other areas the rest of helmand rather than from just around garmsir that is telling us about the success were having that we are affecting and disrupting them we are defeating the enemy when they oppose us and when they reinforce were defeating them as well
1996466 i think the most telling aspect is that an afghan citizen of garmsir had no qualms about bringing his wounded child to a newly established marine position where marines were heavily armed
1996467 here is a man who has first hand experience of life under the taliban he knows that with them there is no offer of hope no plan and no future he knows we are here to help
1996468 when you protect us we will be able to protect you
1996469 we started in garmsir as far as ending it i will tell you that its not time driven we will leave garmsir at the time and place of our choosing
1996470 they wont let us in but we have a group that will cross in another spot
1996471 theyll have to strip search everyone who crosses that border or they wont know who we are theyll have to see the wbc westboro baptist church tattoo on our butts
1996472 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
1996473 these incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics and will do nothing to help the good people of tennessee its time to turn the page on a politics driven by negativity and division so that we can come together to lift up our communities and our country
1996474 are running some of the most exciting competitive challenger races in the country and gaining critical ground in historically republican districts ranging from doctors businesswomen and public servants these women are leading the way on issues affecting american families every day emilys list members are proud to support these democratic women and help elect them to the united states house in november
1996475 it says memphis has come a long long way and that people who were counting on racial voting to prevail are thinking of a memphis that doesnt exist anymore
1996476 the people of memphis are more sophisticated voters that deal with issues and someones record and not simply race
1996477 nikki tinker is a tenacious advocate and respected lawyer who will bring an exceptional combination of fresh new ideas and tested political savvy to her service as memphiss next congresswoman from her experience as a top business executive for a commercial airline to her defense of workers who face employment discrimination and civil rights abuses to her leadership as the campaign manager for rep harold ford jr tinker is clearly the best candidate to ensure the people of tennessees 9th congressional district continue having a strong independent voice in congress
1996478 emilys list members are also extremely excited about this tremendous opportunity to add a young dynamic leader like nikki tinker to the u s congress and they will dedicate their considerable strength to seeing that nikki tinker is victorious in november
1996479 these are the bad guys just take our word for it
1996480 in my opinion you have no taste and are stupid
1996481 mass deaths and place at risk the continuity of the operations of the united states government
1996482 given the danger to the safety of the united states
1996483 it is not practicable to apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the united states district courts
1996484 actually he does not red the problem as sandy and i see it is that the media and people like cc turn to foul language when they cant argue properly
1996485 were looking at the whole issue of business performance management as being increasingly critical so as far as being easier to use and more powerful integration into the tool set its very important to the work were doing
1996486 more and more customers are asking for fully integrated solutions not just a database so the ability to integrate tightly with the rest of the stack is very important
1996487 most of the features are really to get them on par with oracle and ibm db2
1996488 in the enterprise space where people are in control of their own destiny they can make their own applications compatible
1996489 we have to wait and see what unique things they will do to tailor sql server 2008 to the sbs product
1996490 microsofts strategy has always been to provide 80 to 90 percent of the functionality for a tenth of the price
1996491 the gap has gotten extremely narrow were not running into customers who are running out of performance or capacity with sql except on the extreme high end
1996492 we need to get away from this home run mentality to research science is incremental
1996493 this is only the second failed attempt to develop a vaccine
1996494 we are still hopeful because there are several projects underway and because millions of lives could be saved
1996495 our objective should be to stop this virus and the best way to do so is with a vaccine
1996496 the bottom line is that we need a long term solution to this epidemic we need a vaccine if we are to turn the tide on aids
1996497 it has taken africa four to five years to build the infrastructure and capacity for us to be able to carry out vaccine trials
1996498 we cannot stop now we are ready and are going to be a part of the solution

1996506 both reactionary religion and militant secularism are on the rise with both displaying a rigid certainty and a desire for power that will do nothing to benefit society in this context it is vital that people with open minded faith speak up and demonstrate alternatives altmuslim com has set many good examples in this regard
1996507 you see more hostility towards muslims now than you did the year after 9 11
1996508 i want my children to grow up in a country where they as muslims feel valued
1996509 incompatible with the essential values of the french community and notably the principle of equality of the sexes
1996510 its not an expression of religiosity but the visible expression of a totalitarian position
1996511 lives virtually as a recluse disconnected from french society she has no conception of laicite the french principle of secular state nor the right to vote and she lives in total subservience to the men in her family
1996512 the symbolic terror of the head to toe black shroud and the relegation of women to its recesses has in an unfortunate play of rhetoric become a convenient scapegoat that deflects attention from the many ways in which the french state has failed its immigrants
1996513 but it is important to understand that in addition to how it is being used as a scapegoat it is also a real issue that provokes real legitimate fear not just politicized fear
1996514 women walking around with their face and body completely shrouded in black is often frightening to people not accustomed to such clothing
1996515 they say i am under my husbands command and that i am a recluse
1996516 they say i wear the niqab because my husband told me so
1996517 i want to tell them it is my choice i take care of my children and i leave the house when i please i have my own car i do the shopping on my own yes i am a practicing muslim i am orthodox but is that not my right

1996544 separatists authorities are trying to save the south ossetian president eduard kokoity regime
1996545 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali

1996555 10 more per month for the new iphones data plan is a rip off
1996556 but when you do the math over time it will actually cost you much more you are committing between the extra data plan charges and a 5 per month sms charge to pay a minimum of 360 more for your phone service over the next two years

1996574 outside of a faithful marriage between a man and a woman there is no safe sex
1996575 it is irresponsible to teach people that you can have safe sex or safer sex outside of marriage
1996576 it is undeniable that safe sex works and has saved the lives of millions of people
1996577 contrary to focus on the familys death promoting dogma there is no hiv crisis for gay or straight men who practice the very safe sex techniques that they have irresponsibly dismissed furthermore how is a gay man in a relationship any more at risk than a heterosexual man in a relationship focus on the familys propaganda defies science logic and common sense
1996578 right wingers should learn about condoms too so when they cheat on their spouses they do so safely and not bring stds into the home
1996579 this is particularly true in bible belt states which have the highest divorce rates in the nation it is never helpful to promote ignorance over education and that is precisely the sex education paradigm embraced by focus on the family
1996580 divorce rates among conservative christians were significantly higher than for other faith groups and much higher than atheists and agnostics experience
1996581 while it may be alarming to discover that born again christians are more likely than others to experience a divorce that pattern has been in place for quite some time
1996582 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
1996583 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1996584 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
1996585 i disagree the republican leadership and the mccain campaign wants to win this election they want to win it as democrats
1996586 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore

1996594 bottom line there is a threat of homegrown terror in america
1996595 it is not as great as in european cities but it is growing and we have to take it seriously
1996596 being an american gives you a passport around the world
1996597 these again are instances of homegrowns who take it to the limit these people wanted to go all the way to iraq
1996598 i am continuing to work to try to bring down the terrorist web sites on the internet

1996604 we do believe al qaida is doing some measure of re assessment regarding the continued viability of its fight in iraq and whether iraq should remain the focus of its efforts
1996605 its not known yet whether he would come back or not
1996606 did not escape or turn his back to us or abandon al qaeda in iraq
1996607 we have been informed he left iraq to afghanistan for several things such as reviewing the situation of al qaeda in iraq with osama bin laden
1996608 al qaeda losing the sunni population is like a human being losing the ability to drink water
1996609 because of masris weak personality and leadership al qaeda in iraq was weakened and split and lost the sunni population
1996610 the quest for knowledge used to begin with grand theories now it begins with massive amounts of data
1996611 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
1996612 we want to see it everywhere but more importantly we want this sign to take the world by storm
1996613 that was a tricky one to be fair i kind of wished that the differences got sorted out but obviously theres the licensing issue for bond even if its something thats already come out its incredibly hard to solve because theres so many license holders involved youve got the guys that own the license to the gaming rights now the guys that have the license to bond as an ip and there are umpteen licensees me just personally i thought god thats a difficult problem to solve the guys wanted to go and make it i guess it probably got to them maybe i dont know but for me i just kind of thought that wed never manage it never quite make it but the feelings not too bad really its what its like as a games developer you have to treat something thats not seen the light of day as a prototype

1996627 at least eight in ten americans believe the nation is on the wrong track the republican president is historically unpopular from stunning democratic gains in party registration to the high levels of economic anxiety obama should have a healthy lead by almost every measure yet in poll after poll obama conspicuously fails to cross the 50 percent threshold
1996628 my campaign has uncovered evidence that my opponent jim martin did not want senator barack obama to be president of the united states and that jim martin voted against barack obama in the february 2008 presidential primary election in georgia
1996629 what will happen at the convention in respect to my putting my name into nomination a roll call vote and the usual kind of process that occurs at conventions i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
1996630 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
1996631 obama gaggled with reporters on his plane between minneapolis and chicago when asked about reports of angry hillary supporters obama said were not talking to those people and were talking to directly to the clinton campaign people and it has gone seamlessly
1996632 mr mccain has beat mr obamas channel for seven straight days and 11 of the past 14 days in a signal he intends to compete for the youtube vote
1996633 that not only in that mccain ad were there two underdressed blondes mixed with the black guy in the ad but there are also images of the leaning tower of pisa the washington monument and the victory column in berlin as bob herbert put it
1996634 comparing the democratic presidential hopeful to celebrities britney spears and paris hilton
1996635 to a certain extent the ads are having some effect but you cant be thrown off your game plan by a momentary dip in polls
1996636 after years of battling with president clinton house republicans are shifting their sights to vice president al gore and
1996637 former democratic presidential candidate mike gravel was caught on tape last week telling a crowd in washington d c that they should harass a federal prosecutor who helped bring criminal contempt charges against a palestinian activist find out where he lives find out where his kids go to school find out where his office is picket him all the time gravel said in an audio tape obtained by the investigative project on terrorism and provided to fox news
1996638 im not suggesting a five year war has helped things necessarily although the reconstruction has but most of the damage that was done to the iraqi infrastructure was done well before the u s came
1996639 it looks at first like any other shuttered storefront near the boardwalk some garish lettering and a cartoonish invitation to a delight or a scam in this case theres spongebob squarepants saying it dont gitmo better

1996643 3 4 increase in single copy newsstand sales for the first half of 2008
1996644 the republican also has pulled ahead on the issue of balancing the federal budget
1996645 in contrast if anything pews respondents said they want to hear more not less about the republican candidate just 26 in the poll said they had heard too much about mccain while a larger number 38 reported that they had heard too little about the putative republican candidate
1996646 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified

1996653 we have sensed a lack of enthusiasm from the obama camp
1996654 stephanopoulos a gentleman named william ayers he was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that can you explain your relationship to him for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
1996655 in may when a mccain adviser proposed a series of pre convention appearances at town hall meetings obama said i think thats a great idea obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
1996656 there is an image right there in that very beginning of the leaning tower of pisa and there is an image of the washington monument
1996657 have you seen the paris hilton campaign video responding john mccain
1996658 will not run ads that are damaging to oil companies
1996659 there may be no corporation in america that has attacked the rights of workers and undercut the living standards of americans more than wal mart
1996660 write to every member of congress declaring that any democrat receiving or keeping wal mart money can kiss any labor donations or labor support good bye
1996661 what we need today is an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones we need to reduce the tax burden on businesses that choose to make their home in the united states of america we need to open new markets to u s products and we need to reduce the cost of healthcare and we need to end the out of control spending in washington that is putting our debt on the backs of our children
1996662 indicates his party is seriously considering another shutdown threat to force a vote on offshore oil drilling in september
1996663 the precise maneuvering of a shutdown threat is complicated but it revolves around the fact that key government spending bills expire when the fiscal year ends september 30 and congress must vote next month to keep the government operating
1996664 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
1996665 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1996666 in the western world journalists can mostly say what they want as long as they agree with the positions of their publishers

1996673 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
1996674 one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain mr
1996675 behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 obama bundlers fund raisers who have each collected contributions totaling 50 000 or more many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington nearly three dozen of the bundlers have raised more than 500 000 each including more than a half dozen who have passed the 1 million mark and one or two who have exceeded 2 million according to interviews with fund raisers
1996676 i firmly disagree that a racial reading of chozicks story is ridiculous and i would counter that any failure on chozicks part to recognize such is just a wee bit clueless
1996677 if youve got michelle as first lady and malia and sasha running around on the south lawn that changes how america looks at itself
1996678 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1996679 if barack obama draws bigger crowds lets have more obama coverage
1996680 the current outsized attention obamas getting notably the three tv networks anchoring their news coverage from his recent international tour seems a market savvy response to audience interest
1996681 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1996682 is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol

1996689 obviously were not the first newspaper to be affected by the continuing downturn in advertising
1996690 we are hopeful that by opting for our employees to voluntarily sign up for buyouts we can avoid any type of layoffs going forward
1996691 the position has been a very valuable part of the newspaper but i felt the need to move the resource to another area i didnt think we should weaken the editorial voice of the newspaper
1996692 given the cutbacks planned at the js i was told they could no longer justify having a full time editorial cartoonist although im taking the buyout im not going willingly im being forced out

1996696 np i wanted to convey to women they can do anything if they know the power and keep the faith the power is within them the faith is within them too so its about themselves they should be themselves have confidence in that
1996697 back in the 1990s your incomes grew by 6 000 and over the last several years theyve actually fallen by nearly 1 000
1996698 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1996699 a well designed mechanism can impose a fee on a small share of these windfall profits without affecting incentives for oil companies and without affecting the price of oil barack obama will require oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to provide direct relief worth 500 for an individual and 1 000 for a married couple
1996700 the truth is that mccains campaign has received 1 33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry not 2 million
1996701 we find the 2 million figure is based on a mistaken calculation
1996702 cheney has not sought a speaking slot at the convention nor has his staff sought a role for him at the convention

1996711 hillary had over 100 delegates from florida and 73 from michigan if he got zero from michigan and both states had been able to seat with full strength she could have added over 86 delegates and he would have lost 59 hmm that brings her total to 1725 and obamas to 1707
1996712 gee i wonder why if you have a black man running for high public office say barack obama or harold ford the opposition feels compelled to run low life political ads featuring tacky sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates
1996713 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign a complete waste of the countrys time and attention and a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1996714 according to data from the google adwords website advertisements targeted to users searching for john mccain on the internet cost nearly twice as much as those targeting users searching for barack obama
1996715 whats more google predicts that the term barack obama will generate 153 to 191 clicks per day on related advertisements but john mccain does much better as advertiser bait google estimates that those ads get 213 to 266 clicks per day

1996729 it seems fair to hypothesize that ap as structured today wont be in the position to pick up the slack as newspaper staffs are thinned
1996730 many of the kinds of stories covered by individual newspapers today simply wont see the light of day in the future
1996731 for 13 years ive been a cheerleader and ambassador for the station despite our struggling in the ratings because i believed in the product

1996740 mocked the generals country and proclaimed the superiority of his god
1996741 admittedly not an ecumenical moment but what is clear from this mogadishu confrontation is that jerry boykin believes christianity is the true faith that jesus is god and that god is guiding america in this war against satan
1996742 in worldnetdaily pat buchanan wrote lt gen william g jerry boykin the former delta force commander seems to be exactly the kind of warrior america needs to lead us in battle against the kind of fanatics we face

1996747 well its not helpful if this stuff gets back to the iraqis and of course in the days of the internet and the blogosphere out there its likely that it could and you know our troops have enough problems over there just doing their jobs having to defend what a u s congressman might say because you know when you bring up the idea of proselytizing christianity to a lot of muslims thats very offensive and if we can keep religion out of what were trying to do over there which is very difficult it would be a lot easier for our troops when youve got a congressman saying that the country theyre not going to solve their problems until they follow the ways of the savior it becomes very difficult for the troops to defend those remarks if youre trying to be a unit trainer to say an iraqi battalion and the battalion religious advisor the imam would come in and say look what a congressman said it just takes away from what were trying to do
1996748 several months ago i was unexpectedly contacted out of the blue by two extremely senior national security officials in the bush administration shortly after that national intelligence estimate came out asserting the astonishing news that iraq had effectively abandoned its nuclear weapons program a number of years ago one was a civilian and the other was military their message was clear as could be mrff is completely right in fighting this unbridled christian fundamentalism in the u s military and for referring to it as a national security threat internally to america every bit as formidable as the external threat challenging america from a revitalized taliban and an al qaida that is now at least as strong as it was on 9 11 they told me that they had acquired a ton of irrefutable proof of how our islamic fundamentalist enemies were using to their full advantage the multiplicity of disgraceful instances of wholly unconstitutional proselytizing within the u s armed forces such usage included labeling for comprehensive terrorist recruiting emboldenment and morale purposes all u s actions in iraq and afghanistan as yet another deliberate crusade by u s fundamentalist christian imperialists against islamic countries and interests these two bush administration senior national security officials thanked me profusely for the job mrff was doing and implored me not to stop our efforts as the complicity of our u s military in massively forcing fundamentalist christianity upon its own members as well as the iraqi and afghani populations was directly responsible for the killing and maiming of american military personnel
1996749 maj gen sutton testified that while in turkey in his current duty position his turkish driver approached him with an article in the turkish newspaper sabah that article featured a photograph of maj gen sutton in uniform and described him as a member of a radical fundamentalist sect the article in the online edition of sabah also included still photographs taken from the christian embassy video maj gen suttons duties in ankara included establishing good relations with his counterparts on the turkish general staff maj gen sutton testified that turkey is a predominantly muslim nation with religious matters being kept strictly separate from matters of state he said that when the article was published in sabah it caused his turkish counterparts concern and a number of turkish general officers asked him to explain his participation in the video

1996755 should we resist muslims who want to seek political office in this nation
1996756 absolutely if a muslim who has who is a practicing muslim who believes the word of the koran to be the word of allah who abides by islam who goes to mosque and prays every friday who prays five times a day this practicing muslim who believes in the teachings of the koran cannot be a loyal citizen to the united states of america
1996757 a muslim is allowed to lie under any situation to make islam or for the benefit of islam in the long run a muslm sworn to office can lay his hand on the koran and say i swear that im telling the truth and nothing but the truth fully knowing that he is lying because the same koran that he is swearing on justifies his lying in order to advance the cause of islam what is worrisome about that is when we are faced with war and a muslim political official in office has to make a decision either in the interest of the united states which is considered infidel according to the teachings of islam and our constitution is uncompatible sic with islam not compatible that muslim in office will always have his loyalty to islam

1996798 the time is rapidly approaching for this court to find that broadcast like the internet and other means of mass communication is entitled to the highest protection from government intrusion and that there is no longer a factual basis for qualifying the level of first amendment scrutiny that should be applied to this medium
1996799 with broadcast television being just one of the myriad of ways that people can access lawful content including indecent content it no longer makes sense from a constitutional or policy perspective to give broadcast speech less first amendment protection

1996817 however we were amazed at the actual number of new infections that can be potentially averted by expanding access to treatment
1996818 the fact that treatment is the central part of prevention should re energise our willingness to bring the treatment to the people now
1996819 we are in a desperate race against time to find a protection that works
1996820 if this takes hold it will have a bigger impact than any of the other protection methods
1996821 many of our patients we initiate on art are very sick and some have been close to death
1996822 when they get better they become better ambassadors of prevention they talk about prevention because they dont want other people to be where they were before and that is one of the ways treatment could promote prevention

1996859 dan as if this whole situation wasnt ridiculous enough already what are you asking for
1996860 good question 160 000 my original budget was a billion but i managed to whittle it down to 160k which i think youll agree is fair and while im still willing to go as high as a billion 160k is really all ill need to launch a full scale attack on google whatever to let them know that we wont be bullied
1996861 another good question no clue i havent really figured out the nature of this attack just yet but im pretty sure itll cost around 160 000 im thinking about challenging them to a death race like in that documentary i saw or maybe a debate like in debate clubs or maybe just a caged debate like in bloodsport it all makes perfect sense if you see my charts i have charts at home that explain everything
1996862 so let me get this straight dan youre asking me for 160 000 to launch a mysterious campaign against google

1996899 i would like to convey my appreciation and sense of satisfaction for the handling of my investment property purchase this last march i found greg swann and bloodhound on a google search after contacting two other local agents and not finding what i was after i contacted greg initially via email and from that moment on the level of service and information that i received was truly amazing having dealt with several real estate agents in the past i was prepared to do most of the legwork myself and have someone with a license take care of the legal side what i got was an agent who did literally everything except pay for the property from our first email conversations to hitting the ground in phoenix and having greg give me an instant overview of the phoenix market to narrowing down the better neighborhoods to finding the right house and closing the deal it went much more smoothly than i could have ever hoped within 48 hours of landing in town we had a great house at a fair price greg is a consumate professional and a gentlemen youd love to have on your side not only is greg a nice guy but hes savvy as well as tenacious when necessary he left no stone unturned and no clause unwritten in assuring that i got exactly what i was after and what was fair for both parties i have already referred two friends to greg in their search for investment properties in the phoenix area one of whom has already purchased two properties through bloodhound and would be happy to discuss my experience with any other potential investors who are serious about using bloodhounds services

1996968 i think it is most unlikely the people of new brunswick will ever pay morgentaler to kill our provinces unborn babies on demand our province needs to stand firm in this matter and i am very hopeful they will do so
1996969 regrettably however we can have no confidence in the judicial process underway it is a travesty that no pro life group representing unborn babies or their mothers has been allowed to take part in the trial the exclusion in my view reflects both narrow mindedness and bias on the part of new brunswick courts

1996979 over half of people surveyed had signed up for an introductory deal with a further third switching to another offer when their current deal had ended
1996980 it is important to ensure that the deal you sign up for matches your requirements no matter how tempting the intro deal

1997005 in every town city and parish examined people of color were arrested at a higher rate than their representation in the population
1997006 you could argue that nobody is ever ready to be president
1997007 you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office
1997008 i never said he wasnt qualified the constitution sets qualification for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president i think we have two choices i think he should win and i think he will win
1997009 while the senate is filled with ambitious men who arent in a rush to get home at night senator thompson kept a lean formal schedule did the bare minimum to get by and then hightailed it to the prime rib or the capital grille
1997010 he was viewed as a lazy son of gun who would say at two in the afternoon im done can you name one major piece of legislation he authored i cant
1997011 he was smart but he was lazy he probably could have been a straight a student if hed applied himself

1997026 it changes the whole way you look at the recent moves in this market
1997027 there may have been multiple positions which were reclassified but they all appear to have been held by just one trader and this was a very special trader with an enormous concentration of positions in crude oil amounting to perhaps 460 million barrels and not much interest in anything else
1997028 this reclassification issue highlights the fact that improvements are still needed in the area of data collection and that the agency does not yet have the comprehensive data we need to make any declarative statements about the overall role of speculators in commodity markets
1997029 data revision reveals almost half of nymex crude oil futures and options positions are held by speculators

1997061 is america ready for a black president absolutely it has been for some time we probably would have had one by now if the black community had ever supported a conservative the way they are now supporting one of the most liberal more than likely the first black president will be a republican
1997062 if we double or treble our development team we need a suitable solution and the virtualised servers are easier to manage upgrade and support when compared with standalone machines
1997063 with the servers the development team can get on with delivering new features to the web without risking any interruption to the live e commerce site
1997064 i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families
1997065 in 2010 perhaps 2009 if the economy slips into recession that subsidy to the rest of the government will get smaller with each successive year every year in which the subsidy decreases will be a year with three stark choices cut spending raise taxes or issue more debt
1997066 i believe its a lot easier to change the constitution than it would be to change the word of the living god and thats what we need to do to amend the constitution so its in gods standards rather than try to change gods standards so it lines up with some contemporary view of how we treat each other and how we treat the family
1997067 i love you sweetheart i always have and i always will

1997072 as mccain and obama slug it out to differentiate themselves from each other and the current administration the reality of a growing federal budget deficit weak economic conditions and prospects that the economy could deteriorate further and a widening income gap make certain policy shifts inevitable

1997091 russian armored vehicles have entered the northern suburbs of tskhinvali
1997092 they have been calling it training exercises but they have not been concealing the fact that they are training these troops for use inside georgia
1997093 the way the escalation went was we came first under extensive artillery barrage from the separatists but in the end i was told that russian armored vehicles started to cross the georgian border and that was exactly the moment when i had to take this decision to fire back
1997094 according to our information as a result of the night time shelling of tskhinvali the number of fatalities is more than a thousand

1997105 case in point the couillard affiar weeks and weeks of speculation what bullshit
1997106 the ppp and pml n coalition parties do not have the two thirds majority needed to pass an impeachment resolution so would need opposition support correspondents say some opposition parties do not support impeachment and nor do some members of the ppp itself so there is scepticism that such a majority could be reached the president has previously said he would prefer to resign than face impeachment last year he gave up control of the army the countrys most powerful institution but he retains the power to dissolve parliament
1997107 whilst he deserves to be impeached i wonder if this is a wise move
1997108 if he deserves to be impeached why wonder if its a wise move
1997109 in this case the army may react by overthrowing the civilian parliament and declaring martial law and he is no longer technically head of the army but senior generals owe their positions to his patronage and could be worried that they would be next in the firing line
1997110 because sometimes there is a difference between the right thing to do and the sensible thing to do
1997111 its true that hes a military dictator who is in power undemocratically but its not the sensible thing to hold elections let pakistanis vote for who they want
1997112 i agree with you that the army is drenched in mushs pickings but kayani has moved in the opposite direction of musharraf in a couple of ways
1997113 ah i see youre realpolitiking that by now defunct and failed way of thinking about politics but which has been defiantly held onto by american politicians
1997114 its true that hes a military dictator who is in power undemocratically but its not the sensible thing to hold elections let pakistanis vote for who they want
1997115 realpolitik is defunct eh pretty impressive as it has been the basis for most countries foreign policy throughout history
1997116 presumably you dont support the sudan massacres yet you are not over there with a gun fighting the militias why realpolitik
1997117 rumbold this post is reactionary and status quo im surprised that you also take the time to defend and apologize for your positions as well
1997118 because it will give kayani more credibility witht the pakistani people which will be useful if the army decides to act against the parliament
1997119 my sudan example was to show that few of us do the morally right thing if the potential consequences are deadly
1997120 how are you sure that kayanis credibility with pakistani people would support the army to act against parliament
1997121 i am in favour of elections in pakistan i dont know whether impeaching musharraf is the best idea at this point as it could cause serious problems
1997122 some people might point out that hundreds of lives if not thousands were lost during the election cycle
1997123 its not a favorable climate right now to let democracy reign
1997124 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
1997125 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
1997126 just makes no sense whatsoever they hold no water at all they are just wrong and misguided the people against him the ones that call him a dreamer are the ones who have done no homework and are deeply cynical and if they dont keep their mouths shut we will forever be addicted to foreign oil

1997136 in the past couple of years weve seen sculpture emerge as one of the fastest growing sectors of the international art scene its a fantastically exciting development and one that has been particularly evident at the recent beyond limits exhibitions weve held at chatsworth last years show attracted buyers from around the world while at the same time drawing in droves of visitors from across the uk what to my mind makes the event here so compelling is not only the exciting nature of the pieces were able to bring together but also and very importantly the drama of the setting the gardens here provide the most magnificent backdrop imaginable and that combined with the hugely powerful juxtaposition of history and modernity makes for an all consuming experience
1997137 beyond limits is an absolutely top quality outdoor sculpture show and it generates a fantastically enthusiastic response amongst our visitors people of all ages and backgrounds are inspired by seeing these works its open to everybody and visitors are free to wander around in their own time viewing the exhibits from different angles with the magnificent landscape giving them an ever changing context
1997138 when poland signs the agreement with the american side about hosting elements of the missile defence system then we can discuss some additional aspects of military technical cooperation with belarus
1997139 we could be talking about the possible basing of iskander missiles
1997140 it is remarkable that such a captivating personality in american art history has been studied so little the exhibition and catalogue that accompany the installation provide a wealth of previously unknown information about chambers whose story and achievements are far more complex than anyone previously realized
1997141 you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in decline youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession
1997142 i think that sen gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador to belarus although im not sure the citizens of minsk would welcome that

1997144 the insurance industry has no role in being a part of health care reform in this country
1997145 their primary goal is to make a profit by restricting access and denying care
1997146 why given the political realities of the country we live in are you willing to sacrifice the better for the perfect
1997147 we got plans guys but this is a problem of politics
1997148 the enemy is not the insurance companies but the u s senate

1997153 its incredibly helpful to have someone of pickens stature in the oil and gas industry basically saying weve got to change things and putting his money where his mouth is
1997154 the easiest and cheapest and quickest way to shift over to renewable energy is with the generation of electricity
1997155 his speech didnt include a single cost estimate a fact that i think disqualifies it from any type of serious consideration

1997169 national security is more important than the republican party or the democratic party and to use it to try and get someone elected will ultimately end up in defeat and disaster for that political party
1997170 it is no longer sufficient to hire a hairstylist and makeup artist to be on hand the day of instead bridal parties are indulging in dermal fillers and tooth whitening months before the big day some brides pick up the tab for their attendants replacing the pillbox inscribed with the wedding date with a well earned squirt between the eyes

1997172 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
1997173 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
1997174 we are receiving reports that a police of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
1997175 will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
1997176 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is what is behind the logic of the steps we are undertaking now

1997195 i just decided that the land would become the canvas
1997196 in the beginning in my first garden in richmond virginia i farmed for food on the table but in charlottesville virginia in eldersburg and reisterstown maryland and last here in culpeper the garden has finally reformed my disposition toward it it has entirely transfigured my vision of life for the sake of beauty i gladly leave the ruffled red cabbage to grow long beyond its time for harvest i let the mustard reach high with bright yellow bouquets i cultivate carefully the asparagus row not just for the taste of its buttery spears but also for the verdant fern foliage that shoots up after the spring cutting i let volunteer sunflower cosmos and cleome seedlings grow where they choose and i sneak orange nasturtiums into the hills of sweet potato vines gardening is not only making the world around us beautiful once more but letting beauty transform us gardening grows from our deep longing for salvation so that beauty fills our lives in my garden i take hope from jesus promise to the repentant thief on the cross that he will be with his lord in paradise i know that the sweat of my brow and tears of penance bring paradise near in my backyard for a garden is a profound sign and deep symbol of salvation like none other precisely because a garden was our first habitation and god has deemed it to be our final home beauty is the aim of life god imagined it so god spoke the word and his invisible image of beauty became a visible garden

1997223 in december 2007 post election violence broke out in kenya and we had to flee our homes to take refuge in camps
1997224 for three weeks i didnt have access to my medication i feared going back to my home to fetch the medicine
1997225 it was terrible i thought id die not of aids but of the conflict
1997226 we had just one blanket to share among the six of us her five children and there was a serious food crisis
1997227 but not before at least ten among us had died
1997228 we have found no clear link between conflict and hiv
1997229 data from these countries did not show an increase in prevalence of hiv infection during periods of conflict irrespective of prevalence when the conflict began
1997230 low transmission rates of hiv infection through sexual intercourse lower hiv rates among assailants than previously believed or reduction in social mobility during conflict
1997231 limited funds personnel and interventions towards other groups and programmes in different contexts that may have larger public health effects
1997232 press exaggerates that the effect is large spiegel said the study he added was aimed at policy makers so that interventions are based on evidence and not on what is assumed to take place based on small studies
1997233 take the case of afghanistan which has a low hiv prevalence rate and where you cant really talk about hiv and aids but it has all the ingredients that can topple the situation the problem of injecting drug use is prevalent there is gender inequality gender based violence is pervasive has poor infrastructure and rampant illiteracy
1997234 after a war or conflict has ended as communities try to pull themselves together and you see increased mobility of people including the military when people migrate to urban centres looking for jobs the infrastructure is being built and the country has suddenly opened the chances of vulnerabilities to the virus increases
1997235 the power struggle increases boredom sets in and sex is the one thing men still have control over this often leads to gender violence
1997236 at times after conflict people want to procreate because they have so many dying perry said

1997255 the new pearl harbor disturbing questions about the bush administration and 9 11
1997256 fifty percent of prostate cancers harbor a common recurrent gene fusion and we believe that this confers a more aggressive nature to these tumors
1997257 interfering with this gene fusion or its downstream molecular pathways will be crucial in the search for drugs that fight the disease based on our new data we now believe that inhibiting estrogen may be one way of doing so
1997258 the discovery showed that these malignancies occur after an androgen male hormone dependent gene fuses with an oncogene a type of gene that causes cancer
1997259 so we wanted to learn more what is the genetic and molecular fingerprint of this aggressive subset of prostate tumor
1997260 these samples were placed in fixative and not frozen so we needed new methods of retrieving the genetic information
1997261 that led us to perform the largest gene expression microarray analysis yet conducted in prostate cancer research amassing information on more than 6 000 genes
1997262 this allowed us to obtain a robust 87 gene expression signature that distinguishes fusion positive tmprss2 erg cancers from other prostate malignancies
1997263 now we show for the first time that this natural estrogen can stimulate the production of the cancer linked tmprss2 erg transcript via the estrogen receptor er alpha and er beta these receptors are found on the surface of some prostate cancer cells
1997264 we now believe that agents that dampen estrogen activity er beta antagonists could inhibit fusion positive prostate cancers alternatively any intervention that boosts estrogen activity er alpha might also give a boost to these aggressive malignancies
1997265 the technological achievement of using fixed samples that were up to 30 years old is significant
1997266 in the future we hope to explore banked tissues from clinical trials to help understand why they failed this should lead to insight for designing the next trial
1997267 the letter is an opening shot across the bow from an unusual new outside political group on the left that is poised to engage in hardball tactics to prevent similar groups on the right from getting off the ground this fall
1997268 if somebody commits an aggression against you you are allowed in islam to commit an aggression against him millions of iraqi children were killed as a result of the western embargo and no fly zone and we have to treat those responsible in kind hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed in afghanistan and iraq since 2001 and it is very clear in the quran make your punishment proportionate to what was done against you
1997269 they need to arm themselves to prevent the kaffir non believer from coming into their home terrorising their families frightening their children and invading their privacy they have to be prepared to pay the price and fight back

1997280 employer groups have voiced their opposition to the bill and the administration has indicated that if it were presented to the president his senior advisors would recommend that he veto it
1997281 i know our program manager is ranking captains on landing with less fuel i dont care to be ranked i think this is a safety problem and i believe fuel is your friend
1997282 looking back i would have liked more gas yesterday and i was already carrying tanker fuel if i wouldnt have had this extra there would have been real problems
1997283 far below my comfort zone and probably less than the minimum fuel required by the fars federal aviation regulations
1997284 our fuel situation had not become critical yet but had we had any delay i would have had to declare a fuel emergency
1997285 i am not sure if the flight plan as given to me by my company was a real flight plan or if they were just telling me it was so that i would continue to jfk thus saving them time and expense in the future if such a situation presents itself again i will divert to my initial destination regardless of what my company says i can do the safety of my crew far outweighs any financial burden to the company
1997286 this was probably the new fuel saving initiative by the company management to save money
1997287 north south operation is very unpredictable along the east coast i dont think this is a place where we should skimp on fuel
1997288 relaying my opinion on the reduced fuel load and my suggestion not to compromise fuel loads in and out of florida
1997289 because in an attempt to abide by the new fuel conservation procedures just adopted by the company not enough fuel was put on the aircraft to handle a simple delay in an effort to save money an aircraft had to divert the aircraft arrived at its destination two hours late finally the pilots had to get off their trip early because of fatigue and because they would have flown nine hours and 40 minutes if they had continued on
1997290 ten minutes of hold fuel remained unchanged because management is pressuring dispatch to fly with limited hold fuel to reduce costs
1997291 ten minutes of hold fuel into an airport with marginal conditions because the dispatcher does not want his her name on the fuel list for the week printed and hung by management
1997292 get management out of the dispatch process and stop pressuring dispatchers to cut fuel to below safe and normal levels create a profile for holding based on reality not bonus program of a few in management

1997295 i would hope now they the fbi can see they were in the wrong and weve been right from the beginning
1997296 i hope they will stand there and admit it was their fault and make some kind of settlement

1997331 the government wants to use these games to celebrate itself and its policy of opening up china
1997332 the election law cannot be held hostage to the kirkuk issue so we hope very much that the council of representatives will continue to seek a compromise that will be adopted promptly
1997333 it is difficult to argue that there are not worse problems facing us for example climate change
1997334 an important opportunity to pass an elections law was missed we are still counting on the iraqi leaders to reach an agreement through dialogue to allow elections and as quickly as possible
1997335 while it is bad for the timeline of the elections it maybe good in terms of softening the tense atmosphere that has dominated the last few days if there is a period of down time
1997336 but that is conditional on neither side doing provocative acts or issuing provocative statements

1997338 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan
1997339 carrying what were seen as india influenced intelligence inputs had hardened the resolve of pakistans security establishment to keep supreme pakistans national security interest even if it meant straining ties with the us and nato
1997340 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
1997341 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
1997342 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006
1997343 the united states military has the capacity to direct a missile to a precise location at very short notice as it has done close to 20 times in the last few years to hit al qaeda targets inside pakistan
1997344 have long been intrigued by the presence of highly encrypted communications gear with mehsud this communication gear enables him to collect real time information on pakistani troop movements from an unidentified foreign source without being intercepted by pakistani intelligence

1997393 recently my partner and i were walking around the twin cities gay pride festival enjoying the day we stopped at the log cabin republicans booth just to say hello to folks i have been part of log cabin for years and staffed the booth at pride for several years i ended up talking to this guy who had stopped at the booth to complain about the gop i expressed my support for mccain and he expressed his frustration with mccain and the gop he kept saying that he was undecided but as he expressed his thoughts on various issues it became clear that there was a candidate out there that represented his beliefs and it wasnt mccain after a few minutes of this i finally told him if you have these views then there is a candidate out there that you should support senator obama
1997394 that experience taught me something our words are pretty meaningless its our actions that matter ive been wondering lately about the use of words like centrist or moderate or independent being that i am a part of the centrist blogosphere ive seen those words used a lot ive used those words centrists like to fancy themselves as above the fray not like the hard partisans of the left and right we are more interested in the greater interest of the nation than we do partisan interests i am beginning to doubt that for a long time ive thought that my centrist views were of a higher purpose than my more conservative or liberal friends they had selfish interests they wanted to support policies that favored their interests but the fact is i am just as self interested as conservatives and liberals i have views on issues and i want my candidate to favor them oh sure i dress them up in language that talks about the common good but hell i am just as self directed as anyone else that doesnt make me a hypocrite it makes me human
1997395 centrists are pretty much individualists we dont want to get involved in politics seeing it as dirty we place hope in leaders that present themselves as centrist and then become more partisan as time goes on we create things like unity 08 that fail to stir anything our more partisan friends do better because they are organized into groups that pressure candidates to their bidding unions make sure democrats are less favorable to free trade anti tax groups make sure republicans never pass a tax increase and keep cutting taxes those of us in the middle think simply sit on our duffs and hope that candidates will do the right thing but we dont press them to do what we think is right and we dont organize groups to make them do what we want them to do we just expect that magically they will do our bidding this all explains a lot for me for many years ive worked in various centrist gop groups and it has been horrible to get people interested to get involved to change things in the gop many gay conservatives dont want to join log cabin republicans until the gop changes its stand on gay rights as if that will happen magically but as long as the religious right which does understand the nature of politics is there making sure candidates toe the line and punishing them when they dont and as long as their is no strong opposition pushing back well candidates will be against things like gay marriage many moderate republi c ans bemoan what the party has become but they dont seem interested in joining together and fighting back again the y expect that this will all happen magically in the end our actions matter nice sounding words wont change a thing as long as centrists are willing to sit back and let the partisans do the heavy lifting then we will always be frustrated

1997446 what will happen at the convention in respect to my putting my name into nomination a roll call vote and the usual kind of process that occurs at conventions i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified

1997471 stephanopoulos a gentleman named william ayers he was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that can you explain your relationship to him for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
1997472 in may when a mccain adviser proposed a series of pre convention appearances at town hall meetings obama said i think thats a great idea obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
1997473 there is an image right there in that very beginning of the leaning tower of pisa and there is an image of the washington monument
1997474 have you seen the paris hilton campaign video responding john mccain

1997478 what we need today is an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones we need to reduce the tax burden on businesses that choose to make their home in the united states of america we need to open new markets to u s products and we need to reduce the cost of healthcare and we need to end the out of control spending in washington that is putting our debt on the backs of our children
1997479 indicates his party is seriously considering another shutdown threat to force a vote on offshore oil drilling in september
1997480 the precise maneuvering of a shutdown threat is complicated but it revolves around the fact that key government spending bills expire when the fiscal year ends september 30 and congress must vote next month to keep the government operating
1997481 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
1997482 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1997483 in the western world journalists can mostly say what they want as long as they agree with the positions of their publishers
1997484 will defend their corporate right to speak but not mine nor that of any other independent journalist
1997485 there are many advantages of being printed by the sun
1997486 its big modern presses allow us to print six sections instead of four to print many more pages to have more color to print more quickly to do more zoning and to have better inserting
1997487 if the roll call of the states is conducted she might might still win
1997488 it is unlikely a running mate will be selected before the candidate returns from a weeks holiday in hawaii which starts this friday that leaves about 10 days until the start of the democratic party convention in denver
1997489 in addition to michelle obama the candidates inner circle consists of just three people david axelrod his senior strategist david plouffe his campaign manager and robert gibbs a senior adviser all three are intensely loyal and discreet obama professionals
1997490 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
1997491 one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain mr
1997492 behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 obama bundlers fund raisers who have each collected contributions totaling 50 000 or more many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington nearly three dozen of the bundlers have raised more than 500 000 each including more than a half dozen who have passed the 1 million mark and one or two who have exceeded 2 million according to interviews with fund raisers
1997493 i firmly disagree that a racial reading of chozicks story is ridiculous and i would counter that any failure on chozicks part to recognize such is just a wee bit clueless
1997494 if youve got michelle as first lady and malia and sasha running around on the south lawn that changes how america looks at itself
1997495 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1997496 if barack obama draws bigger crowds lets have more obama coverage
1997497 the current outsized attention obamas getting notably the three tv networks anchoring their news coverage from his recent international tour seems a market savvy response to audience interest
1997498 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions

1997507 we are hopeful that by opting for our employees to voluntarily sign up for buyouts we can avoid any type of layoffs going forward
1997508 the position has been a very valuable part of the newspaper but i felt the need to move the resource to another area i didnt think we should weaken the editorial voice of the newspaper

1997513 np i wanted to convey to women they can do anything if they know the power and keep the faith the power is within them the faith is within them too so its about themselves they should be themselves have confidence in that
1997514 back in the 1990s your incomes grew by 6 000 and over the last several years theyve actually fallen by nearly 1 000
1997515 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1997516 a well designed mechanism can impose a fee on a small share of these windfall profits without affecting incentives for oil companies and without affecting the price of oil barack obama will require oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to provide direct relief worth 500 for an individual and 1 000 for a married couple
1997517 the truth is that mccains campaign has received 1 33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry not 2 million
1997518 we find the 2 million figure is based on a mistaken calculation
1997519 cheney has not sought a speaking slot at the convention nor has his staff sought a role for him at the convention
1997520 the vice president has a great deal of respect for john mccain and as of last friday was out campaigning for him
1997521 claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
1997522 was designed to portray a false link between husseins regime and al qaeda as a justification for the iraq war

1997528 hillary had over 100 delegates from florida and 73 from michigan if he got zero from michigan and both states had been able to seat with full strength she could have added over 86 delegates and he would have lost 59 hmm that brings her total to 1725 and obamas to 1707
1997529 gee i wonder why if you have a black man running for high public office say barack obama or harold ford the opposition feels compelled to run low life political ads featuring tacky sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates
1997530 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign a complete waste of the countrys time and attention and a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1997531 according to data from the google adwords website advertisements targeted to users searching for john mccain on the internet cost nearly twice as much as those targeting users searching for barack obama
1997532 whats more google predicts that the term barack obama will generate 153 to 191 clicks per day on related advertisements but john mccain does much better as advertiser bait google estimates that those ads get 213 to 266 clicks per day

1997546 it seems fair to hypothesize that ap as structured today wont be in the position to pick up the slack as newspaper staffs are thinned
1997547 many of the kinds of stories covered by individual newspapers today simply wont see the light of day in the future
1997548 for 13 years ive been a cheerleader and ambassador for the station despite our struggling in the ratings because i believed in the product
1997549 ive been coming around to the opinion that bloggers are just journalists
1997550 im willing to make the same prediction about blogging that i made 10 years ago about internet companies in 10 years there wont be an distinction
1997551 being a blogger does not make you a journalist any more than being a journalist makes you a blogger

1997556 if there are three publishers including a small independent that gets maybe 20 percent of the usage most businesses are going to want to have access to that 20 percent
1997557 they delivered two to the house across the street and its been vacant since last october
1997558 if you want to see reasoned analysis at its best you have to read the paragraph farmer

1997564 not by might nor by power but by my spirit says the lord of hosts
1997565 unless the lord builds the house they labor in vain who build it unless the lord guards the city the watchman stays awake in vain
1997566 for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise
1997567 delight yourself also in the lord and he shall give you the desires of your heart
1997568 the force level that we have in afghanistan is one that was placed there on advice to do the job that we want it to do
1997569 and i have twice or three times now increased that force level i am willing to do that if thats the military advice
1997570 we are not doing that to release additional troops to afghanistan
1997571 we are i think being stretched by the fact we have two medium sized operations going on i dont make any bones about that
1997572 but if in the future that happens and thats what the military say they need we have never previously said they are not going to be given it
1997573 we have to go with what they say they need
1997574 the troops out here have had a very difficult june and july those have been tough months for them and we have paid a high price over those months for the progress we have made
1997575 the whole anthrax case would make for a good journalism class
1997576 my sources were good we just got information that became outdated before they could update
1997577 former un weapons inspectors say the anthrax found in a letter to senator daschle is nearly identical to samples they recovered in iraq in 1994
1997578 the whole anthrax case is one of the things that would make for a good journalism class
1997579 we just got information that became outdated before they could update
1997580 our sources were current and former government scientists who were all involved in analyzing the substance in the letter
1997581 i think ross largely met the challenge about his anthrax reporting posed earlier this week by jay rosen and dan gillmor even if he didnt answer their three questions point by point
1997582 it is interesting to note there is no evidence of aluminum in the sample
1997583 white house spokesman ari fleischer had denied that bentonite was found on the letters but another senior white house official backed off fleischers comments
1997584 at this point there does not appear to be bentonite
1997585 the meeting along with iraqs stockpiles of biological weapons have led some to question whether atta and saddam hussein were not somehow behind the anthrax attacks in the united states
1997586 scientists conducting tests were saying it was bentonite and must have been iraq
1997587 the amount of energy needed to disperse the spores by merely opening an envelope was trivial which is virtually diagnostic of achieving the appropriate coating
1997588 in order for a formulation to do what the one in daschles office appears to have done be easily airborne it would require special treatment
1997589 here is one advantage bloggers have in the struggle for reputation for the users trust they are closer to the transaction where trust gets built up on the web theres a big difference between tapping a built up asset like the st pete times brand and creating it from scratch
1997590 you dont own the eyeballs you dont own the press which is now divided into pro and amateur zones you dont control production on the new platform which isnt one way theres a new balance of power between you and us
1997591 howard weaver vice president for news at the mcclatchy company said it comes as close as anything ive seen to a roadmap for the near future
1997592 just so you know the media has no mind it cannot make decisions which means it does not get behind candidates it does not decide to oppose your guy or gal it is a beast without a brain most of the time it doesnt know what its doing
1997593 im just advising newsroom joe and jill make room for fdl in your own ideas about whats coming on news wise dont let your own formula blog opinion fake you out a conspiracy of the like minded to find out what happened when the national news media isnt inclined to tell us might be way more practical than you think
1997594 were at the twilight of the curmudgeon class in newsrooms and j schools though they can still do a lot of damage you know theyre giving up when they no longer bother to inform themselves about what they themselves say is happening
1997595 the important thing is to show integrity not to be a neuter politically and having good facts that hold up is a bigger advantage than claiming to reflect all sides equally well
1997596 enterprise reporting goes pro am assignments are open sourced they begin online reporters working with smart users and blogging editors get the story the pack wouldnt couldnt or didnt
1997597 newassignment net just launched its first reporting project a partnership with wired com and newsvine its called assignment zero heres the deal and the links
1997598 a highly satisfying failure jeff howe called it in wired no a spectacularly successful failure says beth lawton at the digital edge meanwhile offthebus net launched this week carrying the lessons of zero into political space
1997599 here are my coordinates for the territory we need to be searching i got them from doing a distributed trend story with wired com and thinking through the results
1997600 this white house doesnt settle for managing the news what used to be called feeding the beast because there is a larger aim to roll back the press as a player within the executive branch to make it less important in running the white house and governing the country
1997601 youre assuming that you represent the public i dont accept that
1997602 bush and his advisors have their own press think which they are trying out as policy reporters do not represent the interests of a broader public they arent a pipeline to the people because people see through the game of gotcha the press has forfeited if it ever had its quasi official role in the checks and balances of government
1997603 savviness that quality of being shrewd practical well informed perceptive ironic with it and unsentimental in all things political is in a sense their professional religion they make a cult of it and it was this cult that karl rove understood and exploited for political gain
1997604 were headed i think for schism tumult and divide as the religion of the american press meets the upheavals in global politics and public media that are well underway changing around us are the terms on which authority can be established by journalists the net is opening things up shifting the power to publish around consumers are becoming producers readers can be writers
1997605 some of the pressure the blogs are putting on journalists shows up then in the demand for
1997606 theyre not equals but washington and arlington have their own spheres over the newspaper and reporting beats len downie is king over the website jim brady is sovereign over the user s experience no one has total control theres tension because theres supposed to be tension
1997607 an industry that wont move until it is certain of days as good as its golden past is effectively dead from a strategic point of view besides there is an alternative if you dont have the faith or will or courage needed to accept reality and deal the alternative is to drive the property to a profitable demise
1997608 so while people in the old press pack up and tell stories about giants they knew in the era when they are also asking each other where headed
1997609 mcclellan bush cheney and rove proved there were other ways
1997610 woodward and bernstein of 1972 74 didnt have such access and this probably influenced for the better their view of what nixon and his men were capable of watergate wasnt broken by reporters who had entree to the inner corridors of power it was two guys on the metro desk
1997611 just one mans opinion but now is a good time to say it the new york times is not any longer in my mind the greatest newspaper in the land nor is it the base line for the public narrative that it once was some time in the last year or so i moved the washington post into that position
1997612 this here is a post for practically everyone in the game of seizing on media bias and denouncing it which is part of our popular culture and of course a loud part of our politics and this is especially for the were fair and balanced youre not crowd wherever i may have located you
1997613 the posts links dont expire you see links to the new york times do
1997614 oreilly feeds off his own resentments the establishment sneering at inside edition and like howard beale the mad prophet of the airwaves his resentments are enlarged by the medium into public grievances among a mass of americans unfairly denied voice
1997615 dan rather and cbs took the risky course impunging the motives of critics rather than a more confident and honorable one lets look at our sources and methods what can explain such a blind reaction here is my attempt
1997616 occupy the reasonable middle between two markers for vocal critic and critics look ridiculous charging you with bias their symmetrical existence feels like proof of an underlying hysteria their mutually incompatible charges seem to cancel each other out the minute evidence they marshall even shows a touch of fanaticism
1997617 among foreign correspondents there is a phrase parachuting in thats when a reporter drops into foreign territory during an emergency without much preparation staying only as long as the story remains big the high profile people who might parachute in are called bigfoots in the jargon of network news the problem with being a bigfoot of course is that its hard to walk in other peoples shoes
1997618 the bias charges are getting more serious lately as the stakes rise in iraq and the election but there is something lacking in press coverage and it may be time for wise journalists to assess it the re building story has gone missing and without it how can we judge the job bush is doing
1997619 there are hidden moral hazards in the ethic of neutral observation and the belief in a professional role that transcends other loyalties i think there is an abyss to observation alone and i feel it has something to do with why more people dont trust journalists they dont trust that abyss
1997620 find some new information and put it into your post
1997621 opinion based on information everyone has is less valuable than opinion journalism based on information that you dug up originated or pieced together so its not important to us that contributors keep opinion
1997622 what capacity for product development do news organizations show zip how are they on nurturing innovation terrible is there an entreprenurial spirit in newsrooms no do smart young people ever come in and overturn everything never
1997623 number one is the houston chronicle number two the washington post theres more and theres a big chart so check it out more
1997624 i think the happiest conference goers at blogher were probably the newbies people who want to start blogging or just did they got a lot of good information and advice some of the best information was actually dispensed in response to the fears provoked by blogging which shouldn t be avoided the sages said but examined turned around defused and creatively shrunk
1997625 the weblog comes out of the gift economy whereas most of today s journalism comes out of the market economy
1997626 the quality of any weblog in journalism depends greatly on its fidelity to age old newsroom commandments like check facts check links spell things correctly be accurate be timely quote fairly
1997627 sure weblogs are good for making statements big and small but they also force re statement yes theyre opinion forming but they are equally good at unforming opinion breaking it down stretching it out
1997628 when youre sitting at your desk and there are things strange wonderful and new on your screen you may have to re decide what journalism is and is finally about in order to cover the new class of cases that arise when youre doing it live online
1997629 its pirate radio legalized its public access coming closer to life inside the borders of blogistan a real place with all the problems of a real place were closer to a vision of producer democracy than we are to any of the consumerist views that long ago took hold in the mass media including much of the journalism presented on that platform
1997630 and big media doesnt entirely own the press because if it did then the first amendment which mentions the press would belong to big media and it doesnt these things were always true the weblog doesnt change them it just opens up an outlet to the sea which in turn extends the press to the desk in the bedroom of the suburban mom where she blogs at night
1997631 journalists think good information leads to opinion and argument its a logical sequence bloggers think that good argument and strong opinion cause people to seek information an equally logical sequence what do the bloggers bring to this my short answer to the press is everything you have removed
1997632 journalists you can stop worrying about bloggers replacing the traditional news media were grist for their mill says satullo a mill that doesnt run without us bloggers consume and extend the shelf life of our reporting and they scrutinize it at a new level of intensity
1997633 the web is good for many opposite things for quick hitting information for clicking across a field for talk and interaction its also a depth finder a memory device a library an editor not to use a weblog for extended analysis because most users wont pick that option is web dumb but media smart whats strange is that i try to write short snappy things but they turn into long ones
1997634 i remember the moment when presidential campaigns turned from just maddening and absurd to completely empty for me it might have happened years before but i am a believer in politics so it took until the fall of 2000 bush and gore were then fighting it out not by opposing one another in any kind of argument but by running virtually the same campaign on the same issues pandering to the same groups advancing a rhetoric that sounded the same but for a few catch phrases
1997635 somehow it had all gotten away from them presidential campaigns had drifted out of alignment with most americans the ritual no longer seemed like something the country did for itself every four years but what a professional cadre did and sold back to the country as politics but it wasn t really at least it wasn t democratic politics at anything like capacity
1997636 were winning to somehow be removed or retired as the operating system for news campaign reporting would immediately become harder to do not because there would be no news but rather no common repeatable instructions for deciding what is a key development in the story a turning point a surprise a trend master narratives are thus harder to alter than they are to apprehend for how do you keep the story running while a switch is made
1997637 spin alley an invention of the american press and politicos shows that the system we have is in certain ways a partnership between the press and insiders in politics they come together to mount the ritual an intelligent nation is entitled to ask if the partners are engaged in public service when they bring to life their invention alternative thesis they are in a pact of mutual convenience that serves no intelligible public good
1997638 how is it you know youre the press because you have a pass that says press and people open the gate the locker room doors admit you
1997639 the answer i think involves an open secret in political journalism that has been recognized for at least 20 years but it is never dealt with probably because the costs of facing it head on seem larger than the light tax on honesty any open secret demands the secret is this pssst the press is a player in the campaign and even though it knows this as everyone knows it the professional code of the journalist contains no instructions in what the press could or should be playing for
1997640 i think its a bankrupt form it serves no clear purpose has no sensible rationale the journalists who offer us strategy news do not know what public service they are providing why they are providing it for whom it is intended or how we are supposed to use this strange variety of news
1997641 when journalists avoid drawing open conclusions they are more vulnerable to charges of covert bias of having a concealed agenda of not being up front about their perspective of unfairly building a case for against while pretending only to report what happened
1997642 no one knows what a political convention actually is anymore or why it takes 15 000 people to report on it two successive regimes for making sense of the event have collapsed a third has not emerged thats a good starting point for the webloggers credentialed in boston no investment in the old regime and its ironizing
1997643 nobody had ever asked to anchor convention coverage from the floor feist said as we shared a booth like real diners cnn got the new gear tested it out and made the request to the democrats the democrats said yes and right there the sky box era at conventions came to an end
1997644 journalists find before them with 50 days left a campaign overtaken by vietnam by character issues attacks and fights about the basic legitimacy of various actors including the press itself including dan rather its been a dark week and the big arrow is pointing backwards
1997645 the every four years headset is like outdated software still running because its an expensive decision and major disruption to replace a piece of press think so big with so many parts there is no agreement on a new think system and there is every incentive to keep the old program going for another election cycle even though the world has moved on
1997646 if israeli u s or european intelligence gets proof that iran has succeeded in developing nuclear weapons technology then israel will respond in a manner reflecting the existential threat posed by such a weapon
1997647 israel takes iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejads statements regarding its destruction seriously israel cannot risk another
1997648 for israel this is not a target that cannot be achieved
1997649 actually increasing the nationalist fervor to build a nuclear weapon

1997702 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
1997703 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
1997704 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child

1997706 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

1997720 this is one of those threads that demonstrates clearly why conservatives think we are arrogant
1997721 that right wingers quote to prove how arrogant we are
1997722 libs display arrogance but complain when others point it out
1997723 libs display arrogance but complain when others point it out
1997724 maybe we should evaluate whether threads like this indicate that we really are arrogant
1997725 right now a cone of silence would serve you very well the comments of your fellow dummies speak for themselves just read them were just pointing out the obvious the dummies are a singular combination of arrogance adolescent self pity and profound ignorance
1997726 wow kayinmaine and her fellow droolers make the du look like a home of socratic dialogue
1997727 the dummies are a gang of self righteous dolts engaged in an intellectual circle jerk a self reinforcing collection of prejudices hatreds paranoias and plain stupidity

1997733 regarding oil and gasoline we know that demand destruction is occurring in the united states now at least initially it appears slowing trade and global gdp growth will affect oil demand in emerging markets as well if the latter is the case oil could fall below 100 or even below 90 per barrel
1997734 investors and consumers for that matter have to keep in mind the nature of what theyre looking at regarding oils price weve seen an enormous bull run for oil in the past year alone with oil up 100 when it hit 147 earlier this year so the 30 drop can still be viewed as corrective
1997735 and when you pull the lens back even more you see that oil sold for about 23 per barrel in early 2003 so a considerable move down even 50 or 60 can occur and still be seen as merely profit taking by long term players

1997983 all of the concerns about contaminating proteins in existing stem cell lines can essentially be removed using this medium
1997984 this work helps us clear some of the major hurdles for using these cells therapeutically
1997985 weve been optimizing culture media on the existing stem cell lines since 1998 but it has only been recently that there have been dramatic improvements
1997986 this is the first time it has been possible for us to derive new cell lines in completely defined conditions in medium that completely lacks animal products
1997987 it is unclear how much these changes are related to the medium at this point as we have occasionally observed similar changes in previous culture conditions
1997988 however these changes do indicate that that further work is needed to understand chromosome stability of stem cells during long term culture
1997989 derivation and culture in serum free animal product free feeder independent conditions mean that new human embryonic stem cell lines could be qualitatively different from the original lines and makes current public policy in the united states increasingly unsound
1997990 scientists grow two new human stem cell lines in animal cell free culture
1997991 by irreducibly complex i mean a single system composed of several well matched interacting parts that contribute to the basic function wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease function
1997992 really the only evolutionary explanation that has the potential to explain the origin of an ic system
1997993 the most basic problem with the conventional use of cooption is its complete reliance on chance
1997994 a system dependent part would be something that does not exist or function apart from the context of the machine
1997995 front loading is the investment of a significant amount of information at the initial stage of evolution the first life forms whereby this information shapes and constrains subsequent evolution through its dissipation this is not to say that every aspect of evolution is pre programmed and determined it merely means that life was built to evolve with tendencies as a consequence of carefully chosen initial states in combination with the way evolution works

1997998 but todd you set up numerous mouse traps with cheese never catching a mouse never so much as a nibble on the cheese you have never found a mouse dropping never so much as once heard any mouse noises coming from the room i think its safe to say that the evidence is pointing in favor of there being no mouse in this room
1997999 wait let me get this straight so no evidence supports your theory that a mouse isnt living in this room sorry other guy but the lack of evidence cannot support a theory
1998000 an irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly by numerous successive slight modifications of a precursor system because any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional an irreducibly complex biological system if there is such a thing would be a powerful challenge to darwinian evolution since natural selection can only choose systems that are already working then if a biological system cannot be produced gradually it would have to arise as an integrated unit in one fell swoop for natural selection to have anything to act on demonstration that a system is irreducibly complex is not a proof that there is absolutely no gradual route to its production although an irreducibly complex system cant be produced directly one cant definitively rule out the possibility of an indirect circuitous route however as the complexity of an interacting system increases the likelihood of such an indirect route drops precipitously and as the number of unexplained irreducibly complex biological systems increases our confidence that darwins criterion of failure has been met skyrockets toward the maximum that science allows
1998001 thus a complicated machine was gradually built up whose effective working was dependent upon the interlocking action of very numerous different elementary parts or factors and many of the characters and factors which when new were originally merely an asset finally became necessary because other necessary characters and factors had subsequently become changed so as to be dependent on the former

1998030 i have to transmute it into some kind of story i have to take the audience into this world and create an emotional reaction and hopefully leave them with something that continues to burn afterwards
1998031 its not about people standing around discussing stuff or just drawing attention to misery
1998032 the abiding metaphor for the play is the fact of having no narrative i talked to a psychotherapist early on and he explained that one of the problems for kids in care is that they dont have control of their own narrative they dont have family photos they dont have family members to tell them what happened early in their childhoods to remind them there are connotations of this in the play its been odd trying to create a world that is so full of absence
1998033 its a lack of thematic ambition but its also about being prepared to explode realism playwrights dont do that any more its almost as if beckett had never happened and i include myself in that damning indictment

1998049 we will work with the channel to weave it in to the current model which is mostly direct were going to compliment sales with the channel
1998050 ive been in places where it hasnt been clear or transparent because partners dont know where they stand i want to mitigate that up front well be leveraging partners to extend our reach
1998051 we had partner meetings with sorice that brought the direct sales staff in
1998052 wed all have a team learning experience that helped foster the relationship between us and the sales staff
1998053 im not going to build a program that says sungard will get the big juicy sales and turn the little ones to the channel

1998055 the new cell lines represent a collection of diseases that have no good treatments and for the most part no good animal models this will allow researchers for the first time to watch the disease progress in a dish opening the door to a new way to treat degenerative disease
1998056 part of the goal of this ips repository is to make sure these cells get to the largest number of research labs as possible it is a resource for the entire biomedical community we hope it will accelerate research and create a climate of openness
1998057 and this is the paper that says here they are the first set

1998067 apple is a market leader by creating a fervor for the iphone ipods and macs it has become one of the most cutting edge companies in the digital world
1998068 ultimately i think apple is a bit overwhelmed and i hope they realize that the lack of communication will hurt them in the long run
1998069 i dont think theres been a misstep at all i think the problem has been with the expectations compared with what any company in that position will choose to do and how theyll act
1998070 the problem isnt with what apple has done the only real problem is the difference between what apple actually does and what people expect them to do expecting a benevolent wide open unrestricted market for absolutely every application developer in the world was naive those of us from the wireless world instead of the computing world certainly saw this as being completely predictable
1998071 why is anybody in the world surprised by this of course there will be limits on the applications that are available of course there will be stifled development of course there will be things that dont suit the powers that be and will vanish weve come to expect that from the telcos but somehow the benevolent apple would provide us with an environment that was wide open without limits and without controls
1998072 the behavior is somewhat chaotic and ungoverned because there are a lot of people trying to do a lot of things and sometimes when you succeed so fast and so well the expectations rise a lot the big challenge becomes how do you meet those expectations this is what is happening at apple that they are dealing with a huge success the iphone has become iconic overnight so they are dealing with a huge uptake of stuff and this is moving so fast and chaotic in the sense that everyone wants to have their application on it

1998332 there have always been people willing to pay for the mac experience and ignore those who would tell them something else is just as good what youre seeing is an increase in the number of people who believe a mac is worth it some of us have felt that if more people would really try a mac theyd feel the same way and clearly its happening
1998333 os x is worth the 700 difference easy as near as i can tell unscientifically from talking to my pc using friends the 2 days month they spend dealing with windows bs compared to the two hours i spend each month dealing with os x bs yes theres some immediately pays for the difference within the first month if my time is worth 50 hour
1998334 macs other than the macpro are expensive for the hardware you get and arguably cheap for the software you get if you value the software and youre not out to buy the cheapest thing that will get you by then there is a value argument for macs on the other hand if you somehow need every possible gb of ram random access memory and hard drive and gpu graphics processing unit performance youll never beat a hand built windows or linux pc unless you factor in the cost of your time to select components do the assembly recover from the missteps etc
1998335 i think every pc company builds a quality product using quality components and often the same manufacturing partners
1998336 no one sets out to build a poor quality pc you build a product that supports the price point you target and provides the margins that your company needs to generate to be a successful enterprise apple hp dell no one builds a lower quality pc you cant sell defective memory or processors and hard drives are pretty much the same the difference is in the functionality which i think is a totally different concept than quality you can use more functional components that offer new features and have added costs which is mostly how we differentiate a 1 500 pc from a 500 one and not the build quality
1998337 photos rotate soon after iphone is tilted faster than 2 0
1998338 it is an industry standard to have a changelog or version history which lists all items changed and added
1998339 for example 1password a mac password manager just came out with an update take a look at its long list fixes to get the idea for apple to be vague and state bug fixes is not right what bugs which ones sometimes not all are fixed or even acknowledged a changelog helps users know what has in fact been changed
1998340 why apple choses not to reveal whats in its changes is really lending more to its over secrecy issue people say the bush administration is secretive sheesh apple is beyond ridiculous maybe apple doesnt want to reveal security issues it fixes and thus just doesnt note them
1998341 theres no reason to hide corrects app store update issue where iphone updates are not seen on itunes 7 7 x for example thats just plain silly
1998342 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1998343 does anyone else think that this was really just a press release that was sent out in the form of a leaked internal email
1998344 good to hear they are taking this seriously but on the other side mobileme is actually a very good service people who think they can do better with free services must just not use the services the new push sync services are great photo sharing is top notch and general web publishing couldnt be easier but probably the single most valuable service for me and what makes everything else really work is the idisk
1998345 imo the macbooks and the macbook pros design is near perfect sleek no unnecessary fuss quality materials clever details what do you think could be optimized

1998369 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling
1998370 perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama

1998372 systematic reviews indicate that one in seven new drugs is superior to existing drugs but two in every seven new drugs result in side effects serious enough for action by the u s food and drug administration fda including black box warnings adverse reaction warnings or even withdrawal of the drug
1998373 based on our current system the designation of safe and effective on todays new drugs could be replaced with apparently safe based on incomplete information and more effective than a placebo
1998374 if ehrs can become a low cost source of clinically detailed data the costs of both preapproval data collection and postmarketing surveillance may decline even for randomized trials it may become cost effective to collect much more data whether pre or postapproval if the costs decline
1998375 i see myself serving for many more years at the heart of the military activity
1998376 i see the act leaving the battalion as an educational moral act which was in my view called for in light of the event
1998377 this case proves once again that the military judicial system views harming innocent citizens as a public image problem and not as a moral issue

1998386 you the uk games industry fit awkwardly into regulatory boxes european regulation tends to carve things into software or audio visual video games constitute both of these things
1998387 the first point is to say that as the representative of the games industry were working on the whole of the byron report and she made a lot of recommendations for both videogames and the internet
1998388 as were working through those were seeing a crossover between the things she said about the internet and games
1998389 by that i mean people are playing other people from across the world its not local its online its being downloaded games are not a closed environment there may be voice text interaction contact
1998390 were setting up five working groups to look at the areas of age classification online security education retail issues and advertising we may not lead on all of them but we want to participate in the discussion and move things along
1998391 were working forward on our solution from our core perspective which is child safety how do we deliver a safer gaming experience for children
1998392 we dont believe that option one or option four works
1998393 we are where we are because of the problems with option four so staying there doesnt help us
1998394 we dont think that option one where you have two rating bodies dovetailing together and having both sets of information consumer facing symbols and so fourth helps the situation either
1998395 tanya byron talks about the confusion that parents thought pegi was around playability and difficulty levels well if you put two sets of symbols on the box my view and the industrys view is that its only going to perpetuate the misinformation
1998396 so i guess that leaves us with either us throwing our hands up and letting the bbfc do everything or putting forward pegi its our view that pegi is the right solution
1998397 the bbfc and pegi would need to agree to harmonise their logos and age classifications so there is no further potential for confusion
1998398 pegi works by establishing criteria for the different age bands
1998399 which is done in consultation with child safety experts psychologists academics and people who understand the development of a child through its various stages of development
1998400 the byron report talked about that happening at around the age of 12 where children have the mental ability to differentiate between fantasy and reality and therefore they can start to cope with gaming concepts and gaming environments that are more complex than they can before theyre 12
1998401 we dont want to put 10 foot walls up to stop the children from playing in it thats ridiculous the whole point of having a swimming pool is that they do play in it but they play in a safe environment
1998402 so thats a pretty fundamental point about the pegi system which may mean we end up with more stringent classification than other bodies
1998403 the pegi system starts by the people who know most about the content disclosing that content and thats the makers of the game so were not relying on someone seeing the content were relying on the person that has the full knowledge to fully disclose the content in relation to those criteria
1998404 there is this sense that people know and trust the bbfc but maybe slightly naively particularly as parents dont understand games they start from the point of view i dont understand this but i trust the bbfc so it must be alright
1998405 every time i have this conversation whether its with gamers or non gamers and explain the issues they all go oh that makes sense it makes sense to have a european rating as a starting point maybe worldwide going forward but it makes a lot of sense to start from that perspective
1998406 the bbfc rating from a national perspective in the context of games doesnt work whether the bbfc does a good job with films is not the issue and i think we need to bring some pressure on the politicians through their mailbox going forward
1998407 i think one of the things that has not been properly understood is that everyone says theres a problem with children getting adult material we must stop them getting 18 rated games
1998408 anecdotally all the shopkeepers say when a kid comes to buy an adult rated game is you cant buy that because its rated by the bbfc at the moment and is illegal for them to sell the kids go and get mum or dad and come over and say they wont sell it to me and the dad says im buying it for me what are you going to do about it now and so they have to make the sale and the game goes to the kid anyway
1998409 what that means is the parent recognises the bbfc symbol and if you said to them would you give them an 18 rated film like hostel saw or some porno film they go oh no definitely not but in the context of a game they go oh its a game it cant be that bad and they dont treat it with the same weight and seriousness
1998410 so we have got an education campaign to do and its our view that if we start from the point of view
1998411 the bbfc logo means its a film alright i know what that means but the pegi logo means its a game and games can have adult content theyre not just for kids
1998412 we can start with that message and then they can start to say ok games arent just for children now i need to be careful about what i let my child play and not play and then they can change their behaviour
1998413 we think actually having a different system helps to get that message across rather than saying oh they all know what it means
1998414 they may know what it means but it doesnt make a blind bit of difference to their behaviour in the context of a game
1998415 theres no doubt weve got some work to do were looking at the age rated logo and whether we should introduce some colour coded red orange green to indicate the bands of age rating
1998416 the pictograms we need to see whether they resonate with the consumer and clearly some of them dont
1998417 so we are looking to update the pictograms and add consumer information and indeed as part of the pegi website to extend consumer information there so similar things the bbfc have got we recognise could be advantageous to pegi were not just saying no no were perfect in that consumer facing element were looking to improve upon that as well
1998418 if we have a pegi only solution in the uk there will need to be a fix for that
1998419 a body will have to look at 18 rated product and determine whether it should be refused a classification and refuse the right to be distributed in the uk
1998420 when we establish pegi we would advice that 16 is the right age and when you think about it children in this country go from secondary education into higher education at the age of 16 we do our gcses at 16 16 is that next level where you go to do youre a levels or whatever else that might be so that would seem to be the right age where there are other changes taking place socially that would seem to align
1998421 maybe the bbfc would look at realigning its 15 to 16 going forward to reflect what is the social norm in this country maybe you should be asking them whether the 15s out of step
1998422 ultimately the uk government will make the law as it pleases but we will not go along voluntarily with a solution that we do not think protects children correctly and thats why were backing pegi
1998423 the bbfc is rating in the uk and pegi is rating in the continent could mean that if the bbfc assess the age suitability at a lower level the parent sees the product sees the age rating and says ahh my child is now entering into a world thats suitable for 12 and upwards
1998424 whereas if on the continent pegi has rated at 18 the players coming from that entrance will be saying oh this is an adult environment i can act and behave accordingly
1998425 we have rules for driving on the road that doesnt mean we all drive cars some people are on foot some people are on motorcycles some people are on bicycles but we have the rules and we all go up the one way street in the same direction
1998426 if you came to the road with different signs wed have havoc so its about creating rules in the environment
1998427 i think going forward pegi is going to have to we dont run pegi but they will have to start having conversations with the ersb in america and the rating system in asia cero to establish a commonality for games that have this online nature
1998428 thats the next level of debate which to be frank we might make some sense of that conversation if we start from a european american and asian perspective but were not going to make much sense if we start from twenty nine different countries in europe trying to have a conversation with america and asia it just becomes too fragmented
1998429 the uk government clearly has the right as we have the video recordings act which talks about the rating of linear video footage and interactive games so we have a precedent already here
1998430 but its very interesting that the eu has been watching pegis development very closely commissioner vivane reding whos responsible for the information society communications broadcasting and that sphere of work is a huge fan of pegi and sees this self regulating system as a model she continually refers to pegi as a model of self classification in this area and backs it as the right solution
1998431 i was talking to an ordained minister last week whos got teenaged children and hes divorced they live with his ex wife and he lives 100 miles away
1998432 he could be living in the uk and they could be living in spain or america wherever the world is changing the boundaries are not the four walls of our english castle anymore unfortunately
1998433 and i think in that sense the bbfc is redundant as far as games are concerned i really do
1998434 the unlawyer said business was not good for the industry this year as consumers had limited purchases to essentials due to high fuel and food prices
1998435 the unlawyer said the positive outlook of the mastercard survey may have taken into account a traditional uptick in sales during december when people do their christmas shopping and remittances from filipinos working abroad arrive he said though that it was hard to believe the projections given current consumption levels
1998436 on a macro scale the philippine retail industry contributes a lot to the philippine economy according to the national economic and development authority it is estimated that there are more than half a million retail establishments in the country the industry in fact accounts some 15 percent of the countrys gross national product and covers 33 percent of the entire services sector as a continually growing sector it employs more than six million people or about 19 percent of the countrys total workforce
1998437 at the same time retail gross value added covers 12 8 percent of gross domestic product 26 4 percent of the entire services sector gva as well as 76 percent of the whole trade subsectors gva
1998438 a recent press release from globe telecom indicated that their average revenue per postpaid subscriber is php1 492 for the 2nd quarter of 2008

1998441 support for breastfeeding is crucially important for mothers babies and the community itself this golden support irrespective of conditions ensures the best start for childrens lives
1998442 nevertheless we need to strengthen our work and jointly support mothers we need to focus on breastfeeding promotion through family physicians and community nurses who work with financially challenged families with little access to doctors
1998443 before the national breastfeeding programme mothers were encouraged by family members or peers to feed their children with artificial or animal milk which can be unsafe for children
1998444 we strongly recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months and continued breastfeeding for up to two years with supplementary food we prepare mothers starting from pregnancy on how to breastfeed their children after delivery we visit the mothers and continue our explanation of the proper breastfeeding practices
1998445 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet we must end the age of oil in our time
1998446 right now oil companies have access to 68 million acres where they arent drilling so we should start by giving them a choice use it or lose it use the land you have or give up your leases to someone who will

1998513 it is widely believed that seawater is chemically well buffered but these results show that the acidification process already well underway may threaten the viability of many marine species
1998514 our results show that carbon dioxide induced acidification of seawater at levels predicted for the year 2100 reduced fertilisation success of an ecologically dominant marine species by 25 percent

1998547 although the legislature did not amend the statutory scheme so as to expressly permit homeschooling more recent enactments demonstrate an apparent acceptance by the legislature of the proposition that homeschooling is taking place in california with homeschools allowed as private schools
1998548 recent statutes indicate that the legislature is aware that some parents in california homeschool their children by declaring their homes to be private schools
1998549 it is our view that the proper course of action is to interpret the earlier statutes in light of the later ones and to recognize as controlling the legislatures apparent acceptance of the proposition that homeschools are permissible in california when conducted as a private school
1998550 the court found multiple specific provisions in state law including one that exempts a parent or guardian working exclusively with his or her children from fingerprinting requirements that support the legitimacy of homeschooling

1998599 agreed yesterday to seek new sanctions against iran over its nuclear program after the country failed to meet a weekend deadline to respond to an offer
1998600 we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1998601 calling on the administration to focus on the urgency of the iranian threat and to impose tougher sanctions on tehran
1998602 to enhance united states diplomatic efforts with respect to iran by imposing additional economic sanctions against iran and for other purposes
1998603 authorize s state and local governments to direct divestiture from and prevent investment in companies with investments of 20 000 000 or more in irans energy sector
1998604 support ing israels quest for peace and press ing the arab states to do more to support israeli palestinian talks
1998605 the radical regime in iran has sponsored terrorism against the united states israel and the west for decades
1998606 the worlds leading state sponsor of terror noting its support for groups such as hamas hizballah and islamic jihad
1998607 insurgency in iraq supplied arms to the taliban and hosted al qaeda terrorists
1998608 relentlessly pursu es nuclear weapons and thus is a particularly implacable and lethal regime
1998609 only a sustained unified international effort to isolate and sanction iran is likely to convince it to give up these dangerous activities
1998610 speaking from the heart as a true friend of israel when i visit with aipac i am among friends good friends who share my strong commitment that the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable today tomorrow and forever
1998611 by israel in the face of all threats speak s up when israels security is at risk and voices concern that americas recent foreign policy hasnt made israel more secure hamas now controls gaza hizbollah has tightened its grip on southern lebanon and is flexing its muscles in beirut because of the war in iraq iran which always posed a greater threat to israel than iraq is emboldened and poses the greatest strategic challenge to the us and israel in the middle east in a generation we must isolate hamas syria continues its support for terror and meddling in lebanon and pursu es weapons of mass destruction there is no greater threat to israel or to the peace and stability of the region than iran it supports violent extremists pursues a nuclear capability and threatens to wipe israel off the map my goal will be to eliminate this threat
1998612 foremost in his mind is the threat posed by the regime in tehran the iranian president calls israel a stinking corpse it uses violence to undermine israel in the middle east peace process it supports extremists in iraq killing american soldiers remains the worlds chief sponsor of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons poses an unacceptable risk a danger we cannot allow
1998613 the most dangerous regime in the middle east characterized by its cruel despotism and fanatic militancy if this regime acquires nuclear weapons this would presage catastrophic consequences not only for my country not only for the middle east but for all of mankind the fact that iran is building nuclear weapons is beyond question and they may be the worlds first un deterable nuclear power so the danger is clear and the question is what do we do about it my message to you is divest iran
1998614 iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium so the security council has no choice but to increase the sanctions
1998615 national tragedy demagogically justified an economic catastrophe a regional disaster and a global boomerang for the united states
1998616 a historic strategic and moral calamity undertaken under false assumptions it is undermining americas global legitimacy tarnishing our moral credentials and intensifying regional instability
1998617 plausible scenario for a military collision with iran based on iraqi failure to meet the benchmarks followed by accusations of iranian responsibility for the failure then by some provocation in iraq or a terrorist act in the us blamed on iran culminating in a defensive us military action
1998618 a lonely america into a spreading and deepening quagmire eventually ranging across iraq iran afghanistan and pakistan
1998619 when the president flatly asserts iran is seeking nuclear weapons hes overstating the facts we have very scant supportive evidence and after the iraq calamity he should be very careful about the veracity of his public assertions
1998620 if his secretary of state is joe lieberman and his secretary of defense is rudy giuliani we will be moving towards the ww iv counting the cold war as ww iii that they have been both favoring and predicting an appalling concept
1998621 the us did not give the green light for an israeli attack on iran george bush made it clear to all parties that the first option is diplomacy
1998622 it is the absolute responsibility of everybody in uniform to disobey an order that is either illegal or immoral
1998623 not obey illegal and immoral orders to use weapons of mass destruction they cannot commit crimes against humanity
1998624 if sanctions and incentives cannot be made to work the voices for military action will only get louder no matter what aides may be telling mr bush and mr olmert or what they may be telling each other an attack on iran would be a disaster
1998625 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months conventionally
1998626 assault fail to significantly harm or stall the iranian program a nuclear attack will most likely follow
1998627 only one option if it wishes to halt irans march toward nuclear weaponry the military
1998628 which leaves only israel the country threatened almost daily with destruction by irans leaders irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program
1998629 will destroy their nuclear facilities even though this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation
1998630 the nuclear incineration of 70 million iranians and the contamination of the better part of a billion people in the middle east asia and europe
1998631 that appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack
1998632 escalating tensions that would peak with an iranian inspired insurgency strike against us
1998633 generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling them in america
1998634 at least ten senior flag and general officers including combatant commanders
1998635 f r berufsanf nger ist die it branche ein beliebter arbeitgeber doch muss man sich im klaren sein dass man f r den traumjob unter umst nden einige kilometer weit weg ziehen muss

1998637 it really serves no purpose to continue talking about it
1998638 in cuba anyone can become an athlete whether he or she is born in havana or in the most remote village in guant namo
1998639 cuban sports policy creates the conditions for excellent training and development but sometimes it can be a barrier by not allowing sports practitioners to join professional leagues or by regarding athletes who decide to turn professional abroad as unpatriotic traitors who are not allowed to compete for this country

1998641 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
1998642 im not a mystery writer that is a misnomer the formula of the mystery novel is that a murder is committed in the first chapter then solved in the last chapter and the world is set back upright again thats meant to comfort the reader ive even heard crime writers say that theyre doing some kind of public service by making people feel good about the world i just dont agree with that when someones murdered it forever haunts the family and the community it ripples out
1998643 i went back to that neighbourhood and talked to people about it i got a transcript of the trial but everythings fictionalised beyond that

1998652 i live just a mile from there so i often see soldiers on the street with missing limbs i wanted to talk to them and i reported on what i saw and heard they were trying to move on with their lives
1998653 when i wrote the turnaround i had no idea that obama was going to rise up maybe in my subconscious i was onto something we are probably going to have a black president because of the baggage that my generation has im going to look at obama and say thats our first black president kids are going to look at him and say thats our president once you cross that line you dont go backwards man i see an awful lot of good happening right now i called the book the turnaround because we not just the characters in the book are trying to right the ship

1998658 the typical bbc iplayer user is a man aged about 40 in a full time job with a partner but no kids
1998659 people really like the bbc iplayer they find it easy to use like the way it looks and have recommended it to their friends when asked people usually couldnt think of anything that could improve it they like it just the way it is
1998660 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
1998661 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
1998662 there is a barrage of new attacks from both sides and a roster of new tell all political books like
1998663 you may be under acquainted with certain elements of the clinton elite
1998664 this is chinas coming out party as a great power of the world

1998672 what makes nitol interesting is it is an existing chemical producer which produced a number of intermediates that go into producing polysilicon as well as other traditional petrochemicals
1998673 theyre highly suited for this particular project because they have access to cheap raw materials particularly to low cost hydropower and have the know how based off of their years of being in a chemical business and understanding how to work with these kinds of products
1998674 there are something like 100 projects that have been announced in this area but we know many of them will not happen because it is also combined with the pullback from the global and equity markets
1998675 i wish i could spend time with each and every one of you to hear your ideas your concerns your hopes for the future and to thank you in person
1998676 but that would be pretty tough especially with the price of gas these days
1998677 reading through findings that societal happiness has slightly declined over the past thirty years i wondered what would happen if youd taken the various anti depressants anxiolytics and assorted other psychiatric medications out of the mix after all theyre in pretty wide use didnt really exist in the 70s and should have had some sort of positive impact on the nations mood

1998685 when i was on the design jury i saw the red crescent of embrace and realized it was an obvious and blatant symbol of islam it does not properly honor our people those flight 93 heroes i think its a travesty that its moved along so fast

1998687 im not going to stop fighting this thing it is very very bad

1998694 we must look at the substantial successes we have been able to achieve but also reflect on how far we have to go
1998695 governments in the past have been complicit in genocides land seizures massive environmental degradation and many other human rights abuses because indigenous peoples were denied their fundamental rights and freedoms
1998696 this shows how far we still have to go to make sure that states acknowledge and protect indigenous peoples rights for if they continue not to we have many examples of the grave results
1998697 appropriate legislative or administrative measures to prevent the acts of transnational corporations on indigenous territories
1998698 reconciliation between indigenous peoples and states can take many forms that differ from country to country
1998699 generally it involves recognition for past injustices justice for victims and the healing of relationships
1998700 the result of more than two decades of negotiations the declaration provides a momentous opportunity for states and indigenous peoples to strengthen their relationships promote reconciliation and ensure that the past is not repeated
1998701 a manifestation of reconciliation between indigenous peoples and states and a mechanism for carrying that reconciliation forward
1998702 the wider public must understand indigenous peoples rights and concerns
1998703 they must act to protect them because as the most marginalised group in this world it spells out how the rest of us will be treated and is also the surest way to protect our last remaining ecosystems

1998714 obama gaggled with reporters on his plane between minneapolis and chicago when asked about reports of angry hillary supporters obama said were not talking to those people and were talking to directly to the clinton campaign people and it has gone seamlessly
1998715 mr mccain has beat mr obamas channel for seven straight days and 11 of the past 14 days in a signal he intends to compete for the youtube vote
1998716 that not only in that mccain ad were there two underdressed blondes mixed with the black guy in the ad but there are also images of the leaning tower of pisa the washington monument and the victory column in berlin as bob herbert put it
1998717 comparing the democratic presidential hopeful to celebrities britney spears and paris hilton

1998722 it looks at first like any other shuttered storefront near the boardwalk some garish lettering and a cartoonish invitation to a delight or a scam in this case theres spongebob squarepants saying it dont gitmo better
1998723 in reflection of how critical it has become for the us military to retain native language and cultural know how in its ranks
1998724 never even said theres a link between al qaeda and iraq
1998725 obama cant point to a single instance in which sean hannity or talk radio
1998726 3 4 increase in single copy newsstand sales for the first half of 2008
1998727 the republican also has pulled ahead on the issue of balancing the federal budget
1998728 in contrast if anything pews respondents said they want to hear more not less about the republican candidate just 26 in the poll said they had heard too much about mccain while a larger number 38 reported that they had heard too little about the putative republican candidate
1998729 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
1998730 the activities of many organizations of the civil rights era
1998731 dr kings type of resistance to the u s version of apartheid could surely be considered homegrown terrorism
1998732 supreme arbiters of which ideas parties and candidates are permitted to effectively compete in the public arena
1998733 our politics has gotten so ah nasty thats the word i was looking for
1998734 but not just nasty also cynical and manipulative right so im happy to have a battle of words because ive got facts on my side
1998735 ive got truth on my side i fear no man when ive got truth on my side
1998736 we have sensed a lack of enthusiasm from the obama camp
1998737 stephanopoulos a gentleman named william ayers he was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that can you explain your relationship to him for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
1998738 in may when a mccain adviser proposed a series of pre convention appearances at town hall meetings obama said i think thats a great idea obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
1998739 there is an image right there in that very beginning of the leaning tower of pisa and there is an image of the washington monument
1998740 have you seen the paris hilton campaign video responding john mccain
1998741 will not run ads that are damaging to oil companies
1998742 there may be no corporation in america that has attacked the rights of workers and undercut the living standards of americans more than wal mart
1998743 write to every member of congress declaring that any democrat receiving or keeping wal mart money can kiss any labor donations or labor support good bye
1998744 what we need today is an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones we need to reduce the tax burden on businesses that choose to make their home in the united states of america we need to open new markets to u s products and we need to reduce the cost of healthcare and we need to end the out of control spending in washington that is putting our debt on the backs of our children
1998745 indicates his party is seriously considering another shutdown threat to force a vote on offshore oil drilling in september
1998746 the precise maneuvering of a shutdown threat is complicated but it revolves around the fact that key government spending bills expire when the fiscal year ends september 30 and congress must vote next month to keep the government operating
1998747 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
1998748 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1998749 in the western world journalists can mostly say what they want as long as they agree with the positions of their publishers
1998750 will defend their corporate right to speak but not mine nor that of any other independent journalist
1998751 there are many advantages of being printed by the sun
1998752 its big modern presses allow us to print six sections instead of four to print many more pages to have more color to print more quickly to do more zoning and to have better inserting
1998753 if the roll call of the states is conducted she might might still win
1998754 it is unlikely a running mate will be selected before the candidate returns from a weeks holiday in hawaii which starts this friday that leaves about 10 days until the start of the democratic party convention in denver
1998755 in addition to michelle obama the candidates inner circle consists of just three people david axelrod his senior strategist david plouffe his campaign manager and robert gibbs a senior adviser all three are intensely loyal and discreet obama professionals
1998756 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
1998757 one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain mr
1998758 behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 obama bundlers fund raisers who have each collected contributions totaling 50 000 or more many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington nearly three dozen of the bundlers have raised more than 500 000 each including more than a half dozen who have passed the 1 million mark and one or two who have exceeded 2 million according to interviews with fund raisers
1998759 i firmly disagree that a racial reading of chozicks story is ridiculous and i would counter that any failure on chozicks part to recognize such is just a wee bit clueless
1998760 if youve got michelle as first lady and malia and sasha running around on the south lawn that changes how america looks at itself
1998761 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1998762 if barack obama draws bigger crowds lets have more obama coverage
1998763 the current outsized attention obamas getting notably the three tv networks anchoring their news coverage from his recent international tour seems a market savvy response to audience interest

1998781 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1998782 a well designed mechanism can impose a fee on a small share of these windfall profits without affecting incentives for oil companies and without affecting the price of oil barack obama will require oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to provide direct relief worth 500 for an individual and 1 000 for a married couple
1998783 the truth is that mccains campaign has received 1 33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry not 2 million
1998784 we find the 2 million figure is based on a mistaken calculation

1998795 gee i wonder why if you have a black man running for high public office say barack obama or harold ford the opposition feels compelled to run low life political ads featuring tacky sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates
1998796 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign a complete waste of the countrys time and attention and a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1998797 according to data from the google adwords website advertisements targeted to users searching for john mccain on the internet cost nearly twice as much as those targeting users searching for barack obama
1998798 whats more google predicts that the term barack obama will generate 153 to 191 clicks per day on related advertisements but john mccain does much better as advertiser bait google estimates that those ads get 213 to 266 clicks per day

1998968 obamas political calculation may be correct but it still involves a price it has shattered his claim to be different it calls into question his political character and leaves the impression he is consumed and defined by ambition
1998969 how is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded this is better than we thought
1998970 i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it

1998973 both reactionary religion and militant secularism are on the rise with both displaying a rigid certainty and a desire for power that will do nothing to benefit society in this context it is vital that people with open minded faith speak up and demonstrate alternatives altmuslim com has set many good examples in this regard
1998974 you see more hostility towards muslims now than you did the year after 9 11
1998975 i want my children to grow up in a country where they as muslims feel valued
1998976 this uniquely american realism has guided us over the past eight years and it must guide us over the years to come

1998985 feeling a little duped red sox nation still wondering if this whole thing was on the level
1998986 if this is a colusion job by manny and boras then then selig needs to ban ramirez for life just like pete rose was boras should lose his license and be very heavily fined the whole thing is sounds very fishy to me
1998987 we had a conversation a little while back talking about what he should do and how things are gonna go and theres just really not a reason from a business standpoint for the red sox to do anything right now there really wouldnt why would they given your age and the contract situations why would they not just kind of wait and see how things played out i think there was maybe theres some feeling on his part that if he did what he did last winter and he came out and had a monster first couple of months that theyd sit down and say ok we want to keep you here the next four years lets get something done and it felt like to me that the second he realized that that was not an option this just went straight downhill
1998988 i think absolutely hes absolutely had a hand in this i think he absolutely has a piece of this scott boras stands to make zero dollars if the red sox pick up mannys options the next two years mannys not 1 years from retirement hes maybe four obviously thats where hes at so does scott boras want to get a two year deal for manny or a four year deal for manny
1998989 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they the red sox have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
1998990 i think when you have great players and you have a team thats a great team those decisions become all the more difficult mainly because the fact that you have two interests at hand one being a player who has rights and a club who has a strong interest in being very successful in the postseason and during the season so the fact of finding a fit and putting things together is more difficult in that situation
1998991 so after the game ortiz left without a word from a clubhouse and a front office roiled by ram rezs decision to cite a sore right knee as a reason not to play just as he had done for the last game in seattle wednesday one player privately called it a disgrace and said he would not be surprised if the team tried to trade ram rez the team captain jason varitek begged off from answering questions
1998992 he showed up this morning i wasnt ready for that francona said
1998993 the expletive jaywalking if you do it right you wont hurt your knee
1998994 i decided it was time to give it a rest
1998995 i dont know im day to day at this point
1998996 the thing that most people are forgetting and havent talked about is the strikeout in yankee stadium
1998997 the bat on the shoulder for the three pitches from mariano rivera that was a big expletive to the red sox after the fine im just telling you there are things in the front office that are perceived im saying that there is a strong feeling that that three pitch strikeout was the message to the red sox and its a strong feeling that thats unacceptable theres a feeling that he didnt give it his all lets put it that way im just saying the front office has not forgotten that moment its akin to nomar sitting on the bench in a game in which derek jeter dove into the stands at yankee stadium in 2004 its the same thing its an at bat that resonated very strongly in the front office
1998998 i want no more expletive where they tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing i think ive earned that respect for a team to sit down with me and tell me this is what we want this is what we want to do
1998999 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
1999000 we do not think that the amount of leakage would have any impact on humans or the environment
1999001 the united states assures strict procedures and prevention systems for nuclear powered warships coming into port and japan is also checking the radiation levels 24 hours a day
1999002 ok you can start the preseason now not that anyone really cares but its a fun way to bilk some extra change from our season ticket holders
1999003 during wednesdays white sox game color man steve stone mentioned a new method to organize the players bats in the dugout instead of being listed by name or number on the cubby theyre listed by the players country of origin or in the u s players case by state of origin ill be at two games during this homestand so ill try to grab a picture
1999004 so last year and the year before you might have noticed how ohio state players changed from wearing white socks to black but during yesterdays team photo almost everyone had white socks hopefully this doesnt change back during the season it sounds tiny and odd but ohio state fans went ballistic when they switched from white socks to black
1999005 im really struck by the concept of home protection in their ads
1999006 in one theres this coach yelling at his team nobody comes here and beats us at our game in our house but i am looking at it through the lens of 9 11 at the anxiety and shame that in fact they did come here and did not play our game and beat us in our house
1999007 im really struck by the concept of home protection in their ads
1999008 in one theres this coach yelling at his team nobody comes here and beats us at our game in our house but i am looking at it through the lens of 9 11 at the anxiety and shame that in fact they did come here and did not play our game and beat us in our house

1999013 revenues for the second quarter were below expectations as we were impacted by the combination of the devastating sichuan earthquake the loss of the seasonal recruitment peak following the elimination of the may weeklong holiday and reduced demand for recruitment services during the quarter we began to see sluggish hiring by our corporate customers amid higher labor costs challenging conditions for certain industries including exporters and slower economic growth in china we expect recruitment activity in the third quarter will further moderate as we believe regulations instituted by the government for the olympic games will restrict normal business practices for companies in beijing and indirectly affect businesses nationwide in addition we expect individuals will focus more on these once in a lifetime games in china and less on job searches during this period
1999014 subjective rankings like this are the refuge of a writer without talent or the inside program connections to write actual stories that have uhhh facts and content what no story ideas the first week of training camp
1999015 i saw obamas rather fussy and petulant response today to the tire gauge if were going to rule out humor i think im going to have to rule in hard alcohol this is going to be a long three months
1999016 his counterpunching was effective i think and you know it seems clear to me that after the initial teeter of amusement over the tire gauges it seemed to me to start working against mccain it seems that maybe obama s got some traction now in trying to turn it around and make the campaign about john mccain to the extent that it ought to be and you know it ought to be about both of them but so far its been about obama i think this helps to make it more about john mccain
1999017 shes the only one who creates a real buzz and a real excitement and that ticket gets stronger by her being put on it evan bayh may help win indiana which is 11 electoral votes which would make a difference tim kaine 13 electoral votes in virginia may help there but youre going to spend a lot of time explaining who these people are
1999018 no vanilla go with hillary for heaven sakes the zogby poll shows obama is losing support among white working class folks among women among seniors among catholics these are the big battalions hillary lead to victory over obama in pennsylvania ohio west virginia kentucky obama is bleeding the hillary clintons to mccain right now stop horsing around with white bread vanilla types like kaine and bayh and go with the gal that won 18 million votes finally like paris hilton hillary is hot
1999019 i think hillary clinton does want to make sure that her delegates are somehow recognized so there is obviously some tension around that the obama folks no way do they want hillary clintons name put in nomination i dont think theyre worried that they would lose the vote they just dont want to remind people a how close it was and b how many tensions still exist between these two parties they want to come out of the convention unified
1999020 means we can join the efforts at the u n to address human rights violations against people with an alternative sexual orientation or gender identity
1999021 the vote in favor of not granting status to that ngo would reaffirm the will and commitment of the international community to protect children

1999043 stretchability is an entirely different concept from the miniaturisation trend currently pursued by conventional electronics and has the potential to provide exciting opportunities
1999044 large area flexible sensors and actuators are another emerging frontier but although these achievements represent valuable advances the utility of flexible electronics is limited to nearly flat substrates
1999045 stretchable electronics can cover arbitrary curved surfaces and movable parts such as the joints of a robots arm thereby significantly expanding the area of utilization of these electronics
1999046 carbon nanotube based conducting materials have been produced previously but their conductivities are very low
1999047 one can say that the elastic conductors developed in this study are the worlds first chemically stable highly conductive elastomers
1999048 this is an important step toward the production of intelligent surfaces that can be used as friendly human electronics interfaces
1999049 in the future such intelligent surfaces will be able to interact with people objects and the environment in new ways

1999053 you see more hostility towards muslims now than you did the year after 9 11
1999054 i want my children to grow up in a country where they as muslims feel valued
1999055 it is unacceptable that nations made up of people who have only just come down from the trees should take themselves for world leaders how can such primitive beings have an opinion of their own

1999069 im relaxed when i play bocce if i have a headache during the day i come here and its gone its like therapy
1999070 i think without the bosnians we dont have a club and without them we dont have bocce courts either theyve been instrumental and i think this club fits in perfectly with the ethos of burlington
1999071 those guys were very colorful but i didnt understand them
1999072 so in some ways i feel comfortable here because at times i dont understand the bosnians either
1999073 i just play for the social aspect its better than sitting at home watching tv plus i enjoy my fathers friends theyre funny people

1999080 nineteen percent of eighth graders 36 of 10th graders and 47 of 12th graders say they have used illegal drugs according to a study by the national institute on drug abuse and the university of michigan these numbers should scare the living daylights out of any parent but some may just shrug their shoulders and say what can i do others will look to government institutions for help the white house office of national drug control policy now in its 20th year has consistently taken a diverse approach to combating illegal drug use its outreach extends to parents and community groups and relies on celebrities and athletes to draw attention to its mission to combat adolescent drug use the white house has allocated 5 8 million in new federal grants for random drug testing in public schools next year its fifth grant award since 2003 for student drug testing programs these grants will expand random drug testing programs into schools in 12 new states the white house recognizes however that testing alone will not solve adolescents drug problems and neither will a primary focus on schools as the best method to reach teenagers their recent ad campaign against teenagers abuse of prescription drugs is a step in the right direction targeting not teenagers but the parents who may not be aware of the prevalence of drug abuse among youth
1999081 church attendance has beneficial effects to at risk youth among american adolescents 8 of at least weekly worshipers admit using hard drugs that number doubles to 16 for those who worship less than monthly and 18 for those who never worship the national center on addiction and substance abuse at columbia university is now researching the success of anti drug efforts led by charismatic evangelicals particularly those in assemblies of god congregations from which casa hopes to draw lessons on the role of spirituality and religious beliefs in recovery casa is on the right track a diverse group of experts such as mark regnerus glen elder jerry trusty richard watts and lisa pullen agree that religious practice decreases the likelihood of drug use barbara yarnold of florida international university has even said that religion is the only statistically significant factor in inhibiting adolescent cocaine use when the statistics for family structure and church attendance are combined the results are even more striking of at least monthly worshipers from intact families 8 5 have used hard drugs but rises to 20 1 for students from broken families who worship less or not at all
1999082 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
1999083 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
1999084 for these reasons russia may not deliver it in the end to iran
1999085 desperate to avoid the merits of clemenss claims mcnamee moves to dismiss on insubstantial and frivolous grounds that are contrary to controlling authority which requires mcnamee to answer to a texas court and jury for his intentional conduct that injured a texas resident in texas
1999086 because most of the key witnesses in this case are in the southern district of texas the cost of attendance in new york city for willing witnesses is substantially higher than it would be in houston and the courts in the southern district of texas are less congested
1999087 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked
1999088 again i am sure the palestinian media as well as the likes of the ism would have reported such an occurrence had it occurred
1999089 reacting if i am proven wrong ill retract my contention that this seems like an act but until then i stand by it
1999090 they think it is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business

1999098 weakening in the governments long held position that settlements were illegal and an obstacle to peace
1999099 our embassy in tel avivs contacts with the settler community have been with the goal of setting out the british governments view on this issue and to seek to convince them that settlements are a significant obstacle to peace but you are right that their presence at this event was not helpful and the embassy is reviewing its procedures to ensure that it does not happen in the future
1999100 repeated charges regarding the illegality of israeli settlements must therefore be regarded as politically motivated without foundation in international law politically the west bank and gaza strip is best regarded as territory over which there are competing claims which should be resolved in peace process negotiations israel has valid claims to title in this territory based not only on its historic and religious connection to the land and its recognized security needs but also on the fact that the territory was not under the sovereignty of any state and came under israeli control in a war of self defense imposed upon israel at the same time israel recognizes that the palestinians also entertain legitimate claims to the area indeed the very fact that the parties have agreed to conduct negotiations on settlements indicated that they envisage a compromise on this issue

1999123 providing theres nothing that stands between me and the close of nominations i intend to nominate
1999124 thrive in the fast moving pace of globalisation and show little respect for national borders
1999125 if we want to improve the protection of uk citizens travelling in the enlarged eu and if we want to ensure that other eu countries raise their game in dealing with the threats from the rise of internationally organised crime gangs and terrorists then the reforms set out in the lisbon treaty should be strongly supported
1999126 the eu has a vital role to play in beating the international criminal gangs which blight our continent
1999127 we must work with our neighbours to take stronger more effective measures against terrorists gun runners people traffickers and paedophile rings
1999128 now is the time for britain to take the lead in ensuring our police and security services work better together across europes borders
1999129 to stop international criminals hurting british citizens here or elsewhere in europe the eu must co operate more closely against crime
1999130 equally the eu is critical in helping britain and the world tackle climate change in this paper we set out ideas for tougher more ambitious eu targets for reducing carbon emissions
1999131 europe needs to act more effectively to confront all the problems of globalisation whether its international crime climate change economic insecurity or terrorism
1999132 approach however in coming to their conclusions they do not in my view seem to have listened too hard to the evidence or sought out expertise elsewhere in the world
1999133 that video content is tagged you do not need to look at every single minute of video content surely you could have people who would look at the video content which is tagged with labels which suggest it could be inappropriate
1999134 we believe that high profile facilities with simple preferably one click mechanisms for reporting directly to law enforcement and support organisations are an essential feature of a safe networking site we would expect providers of all internet services based upon user participation to move towards these standards without delay
1999135 i feel outraged and i think media should write about this to force apple take some legal action
1999136 mr wickett is that rarely heard from but best of all possible reviewers the dedicated and knowledgeable fan he writes clean cutting and fresh reviews that represent a sensibility unspoiled by over exposure to the biz of books but deeply in love with them
1999137 dan wickett is serious about a good read but the ewn email list doesnt just deliver his sure footed reviews it also brings you news and connectiosn to other writers sign up now he understands what readers want to know about books
1999138 dan wickett is a readers best friend not only does he read and trenchantly review new work but he looks back to books that deserve ongoing readership ive lost track of the number of times hes led me to boks that i overlooked or never knew about and that were a delight there arent many reviewers i will let shape my library but dan wickett is one
1999139 we have well worked principles about how we share information using bi lateral relationships built up over many years
1999140 we share information whenever we need to do so and while the idea of dumping everything in a big pool may have a superficial attraction we would want to know that everyone was contributing equally and the information shared was properly protected
1999141 it appears that this sector cannot be managed politically by individual member states
1999142 this report reveals the enormous scope of brussels ambitions for eu control over vital areas of national security policy while practical co operation between eu partners is important the government must resolutely resist any attempt to fetter british control over this important policy area
1999143 the uk has followed the workings of the future group and has fed in where possible
1999144 mi5 and mi6 could be forced to share their intelligence with the rest of europe under new proposals from the eu
1999145 going to war without france is like going deer hunting without your accordion
1999146 by and large these are not run to identify spies they are run to thwart what the officer is trying to do to us and to learn more about what they are trying to do to us
1999147 it can also pay off enormously in intelligence as in football an offense can be the best defense
1999148 would you like to use a gift or merchandise card or apply a coupon
1999149 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1999150 no matter what penalty hamdan had received he is subject to possible indefinite detention by the us military
1999151 the number of newly laid off people signing up for jobless benefits last week climbed to its highest point in more than six years as companies cut back given the faltering economy
1999152 rose by a seasonally adjusted 7 000 to 455 000 last week which is
1999153 at least eight in ten americans believe the nation is on the wrong track the republican president is historically unpopular from stunning democratic gains in party registration to the high levels of economic anxiety obama should have a healthy lead by almost every measure yet in poll after poll obama conspicuously fails to cross the 50 percent threshold
1999154 my campaign has uncovered evidence that my opponent jim martin did not want senator barack obama to be president of the united states and that jim martin voted against barack obama in the february 2008 presidential primary election in georgia
1999155 what will happen at the convention in respect to my putting my name into nomination a roll call vote and the usual kind of process that occurs at conventions i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
1999156 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
1999157 obama gaggled with reporters on his plane between minneapolis and chicago when asked about reports of angry hillary supporters obama said were not talking to those people and were talking to directly to the clinton campaign people and it has gone seamlessly
1999158 mr mccain has beat mr obamas channel for seven straight days and 11 of the past 14 days in a signal he intends to compete for the youtube vote
1999159 that not only in that mccain ad were there two underdressed blondes mixed with the black guy in the ad but there are also images of the leaning tower of pisa the washington monument and the victory column in berlin as bob herbert put it
1999160 comparing the democratic presidential hopeful to celebrities britney spears and paris hilton
1999161 to a certain extent the ads are having some effect but you cant be thrown off your game plan by a momentary dip in polls
1999162 after years of battling with president clinton house republicans are shifting their sights to vice president al gore and
1999163 former democratic presidential candidate mike gravel was caught on tape last week telling a crowd in washington d c that they should harass a federal prosecutor who helped bring criminal contempt charges against a palestinian activist find out where he lives find out where his kids go to school find out where his office is picket him all the time gravel said in an audio tape obtained by the investigative project on terrorism and provided to fox news
1999164 im not suggesting a five year war has helped things necessarily although the reconstruction has but most of the damage that was done to the iraqi infrastructure was done well before the u s came
1999165 it looks at first like any other shuttered storefront near the boardwalk some garish lettering and a cartoonish invitation to a delight or a scam in this case theres spongebob squarepants saying it dont gitmo better
1999166 in reflection of how critical it has become for the us military to retain native language and cultural know how in its ranks
1999167 never even said theres a link between al qaeda and iraq
1999168 obama cant point to a single instance in which sean hannity or talk radio
1999169 3 4 increase in single copy newsstand sales for the first half of 2008
1999170 the republican also has pulled ahead on the issue of balancing the federal budget
1999171 in contrast if anything pews respondents said they want to hear more not less about the republican candidate just 26 in the poll said they had heard too much about mccain while a larger number 38 reported that they had heard too little about the putative republican candidate
1999172 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
1999173 the activities of many organizations of the civil rights era
1999174 dr kings type of resistance to the u s version of apartheid could surely be considered homegrown terrorism
1999175 supreme arbiters of which ideas parties and candidates are permitted to effectively compete in the public arena
1999176 our politics has gotten so ah nasty thats the word i was looking for
1999177 but not just nasty also cynical and manipulative right so im happy to have a battle of words because ive got facts on my side
1999178 ive got truth on my side i fear no man when ive got truth on my side
1999179 we have sensed a lack of enthusiasm from the obama camp
1999180 stephanopoulos a gentleman named william ayers he was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that can you explain your relationship to him for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
1999181 in may when a mccain adviser proposed a series of pre convention appearances at town hall meetings obama said i think thats a great idea obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
1999182 there is an image right there in that very beginning of the leaning tower of pisa and there is an image of the washington monument
1999183 have you seen the paris hilton campaign video responding john mccain
1999184 will not run ads that are damaging to oil companies
1999185 there may be no corporation in america that has attacked the rights of workers and undercut the living standards of americans more than wal mart
1999186 write to every member of congress declaring that any democrat receiving or keeping wal mart money can kiss any labor donations or labor support good bye
1999187 what we need today is an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones we need to reduce the tax burden on businesses that choose to make their home in the united states of america we need to open new markets to u s products and we need to reduce the cost of healthcare and we need to end the out of control spending in washington that is putting our debt on the backs of our children
1999188 indicates his party is seriously considering another shutdown threat to force a vote on offshore oil drilling in september
1999189 the precise maneuvering of a shutdown threat is complicated but it revolves around the fact that key government spending bills expire when the fiscal year ends september 30 and congress must vote next month to keep the government operating
1999190 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
1999191 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1999192 in the western world journalists can mostly say what they want as long as they agree with the positions of their publishers
1999193 will defend their corporate right to speak but not mine nor that of any other independent journalist
1999194 there are many advantages of being printed by the sun
1999195 its big modern presses allow us to print six sections instead of four to print many more pages to have more color to print more quickly to do more zoning and to have better inserting
1999196 if the roll call of the states is conducted she might might still win
1999197 it is unlikely a running mate will be selected before the candidate returns from a weeks holiday in hawaii which starts this friday that leaves about 10 days until the start of the democratic party convention in denver
1999198 in addition to michelle obama the candidates inner circle consists of just three people david axelrod his senior strategist david plouffe his campaign manager and robert gibbs a senior adviser all three are intensely loyal and discreet obama professionals
1999199 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
1999200 one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain mr
1999201 behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 obama bundlers fund raisers who have each collected contributions totaling 50 000 or more many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington nearly three dozen of the bundlers have raised more than 500 000 each including more than a half dozen who have passed the 1 million mark and one or two who have exceeded 2 million according to interviews with fund raisers
1999202 i firmly disagree that a racial reading of chozicks story is ridiculous and i would counter that any failure on chozicks part to recognize such is just a wee bit clueless
1999203 if youve got michelle as first lady and malia and sasha running around on the south lawn that changes how america looks at itself
1999204 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1999205 if barack obama draws bigger crowds lets have more obama coverage
1999206 the current outsized attention obamas getting notably the three tv networks anchoring their news coverage from his recent international tour seems a market savvy response to audience interest
1999207 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1999208 is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol

1999212 nbc nightly news devoted more than two minutes out of its total of 22 minutes or so of news time to this story
1999213 we are at war the economy is in the tank no one can afford gas in the tank but two minutes was given to this mouse research
1999214 my status has not changed although in a technical way it has i am on call to the editor of the post when they deem that they need reporting and editing from me
1999215 obviously were not the first newspaper to be affected by the continuing downturn in advertising
1999216 we are hopeful that by opting for our employees to voluntarily sign up for buyouts we can avoid any type of layoffs going forward
1999217 the position has been a very valuable part of the newspaper but i felt the need to move the resource to another area i didnt think we should weaken the editorial voice of the newspaper
1999218 given the cutbacks planned at the js i was told they could no longer justify having a full time editorial cartoonist although im taking the buyout im not going willingly im being forced out

1999221 felling i wish that we would see some accountability where if somebody gets it right you know they get a little bit more airtime in the fall but if somebody gets it wrong they are grounded
1999222 np i wanted to convey to women they can do anything if they know the power and keep the faith the power is within them the faith is within them too so its about themselves they should be themselves have confidence in that
1999223 back in the 1990s your incomes grew by 6 000 and over the last several years theyve actually fallen by nearly 1 000
1999224 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1999225 a well designed mechanism can impose a fee on a small share of these windfall profits without affecting incentives for oil companies and without affecting the price of oil barack obama will require oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to provide direct relief worth 500 for an individual and 1 000 for a married couple
1999226 the truth is that mccains campaign has received 1 33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry not 2 million
1999227 we find the 2 million figure is based on a mistaken calculation
1999228 cheney has not sought a speaking slot at the convention nor has his staff sought a role for him at the convention
1999229 the vice president has a great deal of respect for john mccain and as of last friday was out campaigning for him
1999230 claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein

1999237 hillary had over 100 delegates from florida and 73 from michigan if he got zero from michigan and both states had been able to seat with full strength she could have added over 86 delegates and he would have lost 59 hmm that brings her total to 1725 and obamas to 1707
1999238 gee i wonder why if you have a black man running for high public office say barack obama or harold ford the opposition feels compelled to run low life political ads featuring tacky sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates
1999239 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign a complete waste of the countrys time and attention and a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1999240 according to data from the google adwords website advertisements targeted to users searching for john mccain on the internet cost nearly twice as much as those targeting users searching for barack obama
1999241 whats more google predicts that the term barack obama will generate 153 to 191 clicks per day on related advertisements but john mccain does much better as advertiser bait google estimates that those ads get 213 to 266 clicks per day

1999254 rick smolan has found another way to support his gorgeous and thus expensive collaborative photography books sponsorship
1999255 it seems fair to hypothesize that ap as structured today wont be in the position to pick up the slack as newspaper staffs are thinned
1999256 many of the kinds of stories covered by individual newspapers today simply wont see the light of day in the future
1999257 for 13 years ive been a cheerleader and ambassador for the station despite our struggling in the ratings because i believed in the product

1999267 strong enough militarily so that the idea of crushing them by force of arms does not offer promising prospects to anybody
1999268 well kennan was wrong we just should have insisted the israelis give up the golan etc
1999269 barack obamas record throughout his career demonstrates conclusively that he has never been a reformer that this image of inept maladroit clumsy bungling
1999270 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature

1999327 nevertheless the additional 74 million paid by state farm pursuant to the mississippi department of insurance reevaluation program apparently meets the minimum payments required under our original state court settlement agreement
1999328 perplexing that he hood would take full credit for a program he opposed and was the foundation for the lawsuit he filed against us and has now just settled however we are pleased the attorney general understands state farm has met its obligations under the agreement his office made

1999334 bill buckley is the ideal opponent pleasant quick in response invulnerable to insult and invariably wrong
1999335 in a world where everyone is poor there is nothing very remarkable about poverty it becomes remarkable and also less forgivable in a community where the great majority of people are well to do
1999336 beyond a doubt wealth is the relentless enemy of understanding the poor man has always a precise view of his problem and its remedy he hasnt enough and he needs more the rich man can assume or imagine a much greater variety of ills and he will be consequently less certain of their remedy
1999337 those who owned the new factories or the raw materials or railroads or banks that served them lived in mansions by which the nineteenth century is still marked
1999338 galbraith insists that planning is essential to our industrial society because the market economy based on the vagaries of prices and demand has ceased to be reliable he believes that much of corporate planning has to do with minimizing or eliminating the influences of the market
1999339 one must begin with candid recognition that the academic reader of galbraiths books is under a strong temptation to react negatively to the authors style and method of discourse he waives the scholarly conventions in favor of a rhetoric which is designed to apply to the lay reader but the stylistic techniques he employs to this end increase the difficulty of grasping the substance and structure of his thought and work against a fair and objective appraisal of it by an orthodox scholarly mind galbraith is satiric scornful and flippant there is often a sneer at his pen point
1999340 the new industrial state fails to present a coherent picture of what it sets out to describe the organization of the american economy it seems to me that galbraith slips from the proposition that the firm plans to the proposition that the economy is planned without realizing that such statements possess only a verbal similarity
1999341 professor gordon finds himself promptly seduced to criticism which even the most easygoing scholar would i believe find remarkably unscholarly and unmotivated
1999342 now if professor galbraith has correctly analysed and described the development of the modern industrial society and if this development is in the main inevitable then we must say good bye to any idea of promoting the liberal socialist or social liberal type of which i myself would like to see encouraged
1999343 professor galbraith continually uses expressions which imply that planning and the use of the market price mechanism are incompatible but nothing could be further from the truth
1999344 mr buckley was running on the conservative party ticket and he was running specifically because the republican party in general and john lindsay in particular were deeply unfaithful to principle because in the authors stern view they were willing to approve any government subsidy handout tax raid public extravagance or interference with sound market theorems that paid off in the votes of some minority or special interest group alas mr buckley the vote seeker ended up doing just that himself one could weep
1999345 liberal economist john kenneth galbraith and conservative theoretician william f
1999346 this house holds the market is a snare and a delusion both mr buckley and mr galbraith have debated other opponents at the union in the past and both of them lost their debates
1999347 it seemed to me then that the cambridge union was trying to tell me something so here i am back to defend the unfashionable notion that there is some virtue left in the marketplace

1999349 i would like to save enough money to be able to send my children to school
1999350 i want civil liberties because civil liberties are going to enrich culture
1999351 that part of liberalism that fancied itself as having redemptive answers for america s problems
1999352 it is significant that galbraith now calls himself a socialist which he didnt before that doesnt mean he wasnt essentially a socialist before but it is a terminological change and it distinguishes him from the nonsocialist liberals
1999353 for perhaps the first time in history they worried not about the turbulent ambitions of the masses but about their yearning for peace and contentment
1999354 modern industrial life they concluded was a thing of exceptional hazard the worker lived in constant danger of begin torn to pieces by the increasingly complex social machine which he served
1999355 i dont think of ken as being primarily an economist i think of him primarily as a social philosopher i dont say that to disparage ken i just happen to think that social philosophy is far more interesting i feel that galbraiths place in history will be not that of an economist but that of a hugely influential and brilliant literary technician and critic he is a great writer ken has a great wit and is a man with some startling and highly rewarding social concepts but it seems inconceivable that he will be thought of in the future as having used economics other than as a sort of extended metaphor by which he has been able to ply his wares
1999356 dear bill that was a very pleasant talk you gave about me if i had known it would be so i would not have instructed my friend to pretend in the middle of your speech to need the attention of a doctor

1999368 this is the largest expulsion of foreign missionaries since 1954 when the chinese communist government expelled all foreign religious workers after taking power in 1949
1999369 at least five different mission agencies and sources within the chinese government report that in february the government launched a massive expulsion campaign against foreign christians

1999390 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
1999391 senator obama and i share the goal of ensuring that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
1999392 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
1999393 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
1999394 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
1999395 i want to be judged not by the number of people we provide but by the results we provide by the end of the year
1999396 they can help us follow up on some of our investigations into illegal gun purchases
1999397 im hoping everyone who takes a look at this whether its our guys or other guys that they see there is clear information to play that final season
1999398 they make more money not to mention that they are more mature to make that first impression
1999399 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
1999400 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
1999401 so even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 risk so i think bob watson is quite right to put up the figure of 4 degrees
1999402 my own feeling is that if we get to a 4 degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
1999403 no other single factor focussed the minds of the cabinet more than the analysis that i produced through that we begin to have to talk about ordered retreat from some areas of britain because it becomes impossible to defend
1999404 theres no choice here between adaptation and mitigation we have to do both
1999405 at 4 degrees we are basically into a different climate regime
1999406 i think that is a dangerous mindset to be in thinking through the implications of 4 degrees of warming shows that the impacts are so significant that the only real adaptation strategy is to avoid that at all cost because of the pain and suffering that is going to cost
1999407 there is no science on how we are going to adapt to 4 degrees warming it is actually pretty alarming
1999408 this would allow coal fired power plants that are currently being built to be modular and capable of having carbon capture retrofitted and would show the world that we take the issue of climate change seriously thus demonstrating real leadership without this technology we have a real problem
1999409 this offsetting effect which is equivalent to about 100 parts per million of carbon dioxide will largely disappear if china and india follow the lead of the us and europe in limiting sulphur emissions the cause of acid deposition
1999410 closed and protectionist european energy markets end up picking the pockets of consumers in this country

1999412 people in britain are paying more because other eu countries are rigging the market
1999413 even people who are supportive of the european union are embarrassed at its failures over energy
1999414 the failure to liberalise energy markets and the extreme reluctance of the french and to a less extent the germans and the dutch has prevented the free flow of energy and especially gas in a way that is very damaging to the interests of consumers

1999438 the netroots or whatever it is they call themselves these days have latched upon the ludicrous idea of expelling blue dog democrats from the democratic party the blue dogs are a grouping of moderate and conservative house democrats who tend to represent more conservative rural areas glenn greenwald a well known leftist blogger revived the expulsion idea daily kos and other fanatical sites have been talking about it for years greenwald argues that the democrats have failed to stand up to president bush on issues like iraq spending and fisa which then gives americans a low opinion of congress greenwald wants to target blue dogs seats and run more liberal primary challengers he trumpets the case of georgia rep john barrow a well known blue dog who received considerable pressure from leftist political action committees and faced a primary challenger barrow won the primary by a huge margin but nevertheless greenwald seems thrilled that he had to devote far more resources to defending his seat for november that is what it means to attach a price to trampling on the political values of democratic supporters making it tough for democrats to win republican leaning districts seems to be his mission
1999439 greenwald and the netroots are living in a fantasy world yes the democrats have a big majority in the house already and will expand it in november yes democrats have a 15 point lead on generic id over republicans what greenwald fails to realize is that democrats already hold pretty much all of the liberal leaning congressional districts any more gains will have to be won from republican leaning districts the three by election victories that democrats have won this year in rural illinois louisiana and mississippi are not districts that netroots approved progressive democrats can win besides poor electoral math the netroots ignore the important role that blue dog democrats play in intra party dynamics house democrats have already moved too far to the left on trade foreign policy and domestic spending maybe not this election but at some point these liberal positions will most likely come back to bite democrats it has been a lesson time and time again that as soon as the democrats go too far to the left they get crushed in presidential and congressional elections witness the 1968 riots the 1972 mcgovern campaign or 1988s disastrous michael dukakis campaign
1999440 liberal democrats lose elections moderate democrats like bill clinton win them the reason why barack obama is barely leading john mccain even though democrats have a huge advantage overall is mostly because he is perceived rightly as very liberal same for john kerry in 2004 if the democrats had nominated a centrist candidate like mark warner or evan bayh either of them would be leading mccain by 15 points the netroots overwhelmingly positive view of democrats chances to build a lasting majority stems from their own inflated view in building it the democrats elected in 2006 until now have been mostly moderates not progressives the netroots approved john edwards was crushed in the presidential primaries much as howard dean was in 2004 they have not yet won the debate that beating the protectionist drum or demanding immediate withdrawal is the right direction for the party especially considering how much good globalization has done for the economy and how well the iraq war is going like it or not the netroots are weak on economically sound policy proposals that wont balloon the deficit or hamper economic growth
1999441 blue dogs currently number 49 members if the democrats lose even 17 of those seats republicans will regain control of the house the party does not have the luxury of controlling 300 seats and it never will if the only image democrats can present to america is of liberal urbanites then its hard to imagine the party doing well in future elections for all of the lefts hand wringing about how the republican party is far right or controlled by fundamentalist evangelicals the democrats have had the virtue of being the big tent party happy to welcome disgruntled republicans like it or not in this country liberal is a bad word if democrats cannot present multiple faces to the american people then it will be much more difficult to win independents and disillusioned republicans in normally red states which are essential to expanding the majority and winning the white house this year

1999472 consider some of the known knowns about the 2008 election no im not talking about senators obama and mccain im talking about the senate elections with such a small number of races relative to the house of representatives and a small set of races in play its possible to list the states that may flip virginia new mexico new hampshire colorado alaska louisiana oregon mississippi minnesota north carolina maine and kentucky i would be seriously surprised if any of the states not listed ends up switching the first five seem almost certain to switch to the democratic party this november while the republicans will have to focus their attentions on louisiana as their only possible pickup
1999473 but there are also known unknowns i would estimate right now that the democratic party is looking at taking control of about 30 house seats while the republican party will pick up between 3 to 5 unlike the senate races which are small in number and often heavily polled the house races are less known its hard to say if someone will be the next carol shea porter and catapult to victory out of almost nowhere or who will be the next patricia madrid a top tier democratic challenger in 2006 who was one of the few to fail to knock off their republican opponent

1999510 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times

1999514 at least eight in ten americans believe the nation is on the wrong track the republican president is historically unpopular from stunning democratic gains in party registration to the high levels of economic anxiety obama should have a healthy lead by almost every measure yet in poll after poll obama conspicuously fails to cross the 50 percent threshold
1999515 my campaign has uncovered evidence that my opponent jim martin did not want senator barack obama to be president of the united states and that jim martin voted against barack obama in the february 2008 presidential primary election in georgia
1999516 what will happen at the convention in respect to my putting my name into nomination a roll call vote and the usual kind of process that occurs at conventions i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
1999517 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
1999518 obama gaggled with reporters on his plane between minneapolis and chicago when asked about reports of angry hillary supporters obama said were not talking to those people and were talking to directly to the clinton campaign people and it has gone seamlessly
1999519 mr mccain has beat mr obamas channel for seven straight days and 11 of the past 14 days in a signal he intends to compete for the youtube vote
1999520 that not only in that mccain ad were there two underdressed blondes mixed with the black guy in the ad but there are also images of the leaning tower of pisa the washington monument and the victory column in berlin as bob herbert put it
1999521 comparing the democratic presidential hopeful to celebrities britney spears and paris hilton
1999522 to a certain extent the ads are having some effect but you cant be thrown off your game plan by a momentary dip in polls
1999523 after years of battling with president clinton house republicans are shifting their sights to vice president al gore and
1999524 former democratic presidential candidate mike gravel was caught on tape last week telling a crowd in washington d c that they should harass a federal prosecutor who helped bring criminal contempt charges against a palestinian activist find out where he lives find out where his kids go to school find out where his office is picket him all the time gravel said in an audio tape obtained by the investigative project on terrorism and provided to fox news
1999525 im not suggesting a five year war has helped things necessarily although the reconstruction has but most of the damage that was done to the iraqi infrastructure was done well before the u s came
1999526 it looks at first like any other shuttered storefront near the boardwalk some garish lettering and a cartoonish invitation to a delight or a scam in this case theres spongebob squarepants saying it dont gitmo better
1999527 in reflection of how critical it has become for the us military to retain native language and cultural know how in its ranks
1999528 never even said theres a link between al qaeda and iraq
1999529 obama cant point to a single instance in which sean hannity or talk radio
1999530 3 4 increase in single copy newsstand sales for the first half of 2008
1999531 the republican also has pulled ahead on the issue of balancing the federal budget
1999532 in contrast if anything pews respondents said they want to hear more not less about the republican candidate just 26 in the poll said they had heard too much about mccain while a larger number 38 reported that they had heard too little about the putative republican candidate
1999533 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified

1999536 supreme arbiters of which ideas parties and candidates are permitted to effectively compete in the public arena
1999537 our politics has gotten so ah nasty thats the word i was looking for
1999538 but not just nasty also cynical and manipulative right so im happy to have a battle of words because ive got facts on my side
1999539 ive got truth on my side i fear no man when ive got truth on my side
1999540 we have sensed a lack of enthusiasm from the obama camp
1999541 stephanopoulos a gentleman named william ayers he was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that can you explain your relationship to him for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
1999542 in may when a mccain adviser proposed a series of pre convention appearances at town hall meetings obama said i think thats a great idea obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
1999543 there is an image right there in that very beginning of the leaning tower of pisa and there is an image of the washington monument
1999544 have you seen the paris hilton campaign video responding john mccain
1999545 will not run ads that are damaging to oil companies
1999546 there may be no corporation in america that has attacked the rights of workers and undercut the living standards of americans more than wal mart
1999547 write to every member of congress declaring that any democrat receiving or keeping wal mart money can kiss any labor donations or labor support good bye
1999548 what we need today is an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones we need to reduce the tax burden on businesses that choose to make their home in the united states of america we need to open new markets to u s products and we need to reduce the cost of healthcare and we need to end the out of control spending in washington that is putting our debt on the backs of our children
1999549 indicates his party is seriously considering another shutdown threat to force a vote on offshore oil drilling in september
1999550 the precise maneuvering of a shutdown threat is complicated but it revolves around the fact that key government spending bills expire when the fiscal year ends september 30 and congress must vote next month to keep the government operating
1999551 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
1999552 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1999553 in the western world journalists can mostly say what they want as long as they agree with the positions of their publishers
1999554 will defend their corporate right to speak but not mine nor that of any other independent journalist
1999555 there are many advantages of being printed by the sun
1999556 its big modern presses allow us to print six sections instead of four to print many more pages to have more color to print more quickly to do more zoning and to have better inserting
1999557 if the roll call of the states is conducted she might might still win
1999558 it is unlikely a running mate will be selected before the candidate returns from a weeks holiday in hawaii which starts this friday that leaves about 10 days until the start of the democratic party convention in denver
1999559 in addition to michelle obama the candidates inner circle consists of just three people david axelrod his senior strategist david plouffe his campaign manager and robert gibbs a senior adviser all three are intensely loyal and discreet obama professionals
1999560 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
1999561 one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain mr
1999562 behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 obama bundlers fund raisers who have each collected contributions totaling 50 000 or more many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington nearly three dozen of the bundlers have raised more than 500 000 each including more than a half dozen who have passed the 1 million mark and one or two who have exceeded 2 million according to interviews with fund raisers
1999563 i firmly disagree that a racial reading of chozicks story is ridiculous and i would counter that any failure on chozicks part to recognize such is just a wee bit clueless
1999564 if youve got michelle as first lady and malia and sasha running around on the south lawn that changes how america looks at itself
1999565 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1999566 if barack obama draws bigger crowds lets have more obama coverage
1999567 the current outsized attention obamas getting notably the three tv networks anchoring their news coverage from his recent international tour seems a market savvy response to audience interest
1999568 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1999569 is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol

1999574 we are at war the economy is in the tank no one can afford gas in the tank but two minutes was given to this mouse research
1999575 my status has not changed although in a technical way it has i am on call to the editor of the post when they deem that they need reporting and editing from me
1999576 obviously were not the first newspaper to be affected by the continuing downturn in advertising
1999577 we are hopeful that by opting for our employees to voluntarily sign up for buyouts we can avoid any type of layoffs going forward
1999578 the position has been a very valuable part of the newspaper but i felt the need to move the resource to another area i didnt think we should weaken the editorial voice of the newspaper
1999579 given the cutbacks planned at the js i was told they could no longer justify having a full time editorial cartoonist although im taking the buyout im not going willingly im being forced out

1999583 np i wanted to convey to women they can do anything if they know the power and keep the faith the power is within them the faith is within them too so its about themselves they should be themselves have confidence in that
1999584 back in the 1990s your incomes grew by 6 000 and over the last several years theyve actually fallen by nearly 1 000
1999585 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1999586 a well designed mechanism can impose a fee on a small share of these windfall profits without affecting incentives for oil companies and without affecting the price of oil barack obama will require oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to provide direct relief worth 500 for an individual and 1 000 for a married couple
1999587 the truth is that mccains campaign has received 1 33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry not 2 million
1999588 we find the 2 million figure is based on a mistaken calculation
1999589 cheney has not sought a speaking slot at the convention nor has his staff sought a role for him at the convention
1999590 the vice president has a great deal of respect for john mccain and as of last friday was out campaigning for him
1999591 claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
1999592 was designed to portray a false link between husseins regime and al qaeda as a justification for the iraq war

1999598 hillary had over 100 delegates from florida and 73 from michigan if he got zero from michigan and both states had been able to seat with full strength she could have added over 86 delegates and he would have lost 59 hmm that brings her total to 1725 and obamas to 1707
1999599 gee i wonder why if you have a black man running for high public office say barack obama or harold ford the opposition feels compelled to run low life political ads featuring tacky sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates
1999600 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign a complete waste of the countrys time and attention and a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1999601 according to data from the google adwords website advertisements targeted to users searching for john mccain on the internet cost nearly twice as much as those targeting users searching for barack obama
1999602 whats more google predicts that the term barack obama will generate 153 to 191 clicks per day on related advertisements but john mccain does much better as advertiser bait google estimates that those ads get 213 to 266 clicks per day

1999624 previously we said house prices would fall at least 15 percent nationally peak to trough todays challenging economic environment suggests that the housing market is far from stabilizing
1999625 as a result we now believe that national home prices will fall 18 to 20 percent peak to trough the long and short of it is that we now think that we are half way through the overall peak to trough decline
1999626 i see no reason why there ought to be so many clubs able to black out in those territories
1999627 thats my intention thats my goal i didnt get any pushback the whole thing is about making the game more popular and available

1999629 its a nice accomplishment and the next important step toward completing the neandertal genome
1999630 its a nice landmark on the way to saying what makes modern humans so special
1999631 comparing the complete mitochondrial dna genomes of a neandertal and many recent humans presents a very different picture
1999632 humans are all more similar to each other than any human is to a neandertal and in fact the neandertal sequence is three or more times as different on average from us as we are from each other this change from the earlier picture is a purely statistical one but it makes a clearer picture
1999633 chinas ruling regime might be thinking that it got more than it bargained for when it won the right to host the games it seems not fully to understand what happens when you invite the whole world into your country it clearly wants the worlds respect but doesnt quite get how that respect is earned

1999671 shortly before his death he shared his thoughts on the theatre and much else in a
1999672 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1999673 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded center contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1999674 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from m87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1999675 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of m87
1999676 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1999677 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1999678 in m87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1999679 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1999680 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1999681 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters center m87 sits at the center of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the center probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1999682 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time

1999832 we work with the power companies to come up with sound backup plans and we work with the other entities that operate our critical infrastructure but if youre operating systems for a profit and making money from them then its not governments responsibility alone to protect them

1999842 det her kan vi sende uredigeret og uden emotio manipulation vi er sikre p at f den bedste emotio feedback nogensinde
1999843 det er jeg ikke s sikker p vi m lige overveje konsekvenserne af det her og s selvf lgelig f materialet ordentligt unders gt
1999844 konsekvenserne det er konsekvenserne af det her komplot vi har levet med i de sidste 50 r det g lder om hurtigst muligt at f sandheden ud til befolkningerne i de sikre zoner og jeg kan garantere for at materialet er ordentligt
1999845 s du har rendt rundt og lavet hvad var det det blev kaldt unders gende journalistik den underlige sammenblanding af amat r detektiv amat r politi og amat r reporter du ved godt at den form for journalistik afgik ved d den for mange r siden da man inds at man skulle overlade de alvorlige sager til de professionelle instanser det rigtige politi de autoriserede myndigheder hvordan kan man tro at en enkelt eller to reportere kan overskue komplicerede samfundsm ssige problemstillinger og tr ffe de rigtige valg der er jo en grund til at vi har godt betalte eksperter og politikere til at tr ffe afg relser med vidtr kkende betydning for de sikre zoner
1999846 vidtr kkende betydning det er lige ordene de afg relser der blev truffet har f rt til en evig krig og en tilv relse i de sikre zoner under politistatslignende forhold og alt sammen som konsekvens af at en r kke statsledere bevidst tillod et terroranslag optagelserne bekr fter christian davidsens teori om at statslederne flere m neder i forvejen vidste alt om aktionen ja du s jo selv at herbert arbusto ligefrem opfordrede tjenesterne til at f deres agenter til at opildne terroristerne til aktionen

1999848 du m t nke p de videre perspektiver det er en kendsgerning at der uden for de sikre zoner er mennesker der helst ser de sikre zoner som en rygende ruinhob for 50 r siden var der ligeledes ogs mange mennesker der helst s den vestlige verden delagt jeg siger ikke at det var rigtigt hvad lederne tilsyneladende gjorde dengang men den beskidte bombe viste den vestlige verdens befolkninger at world trade center og madrid kun var en forsmag p hvad terroristerne er i stand til de skyer ingen midler bomben v kkede befolkningerne til at indse alvoren
1999849 hvis befolkningerne blot var blevet v kket med sandheden om at deres ledere forr dte dem ville meget se anderledes ud men allerede dengang blev de virkeligt v sentlige historier benbart bremset s vigtigere begivenheder som world song contest kunne blive vist
1999850 ja verden ville nok v re anderledes men ikke bedre
1999851 og hvad det v sentlige ang r det ville ikke have gavnet samfundet p nogen m de at have bragt historien et totalt sammenbrud i den vestlige verdens politiske system ville have v ret konsekvensen hvilket vestens fjender ville have bifaldet d t er v sentligt d t er med til at vurdere om historien skal bringes

1999853 klar tale tager benbart ikke journalistikkens rolle som samfundets vagthund alvorligt men det er jeg sikker p at andre mediehuse g r
1999854 samfundets vagthund jeg troede ikke at der var nogen der stadig brugte det udtryk men hvis du absolut vil bruge det udtryk okay klar tale er i h j grad samfundets vagthund vi leverer det n dvendige rlige antal afsl ringer af bestikkelser og magtmisbrug s folk bevarer troen p vores samfundsmodel det du taler om er at nedbryde selve samfundsfundamentet du vil lade vagthunden s tte ild til bygningen som den passer p

1999857 p en gang s mistroisk og dog s naiv tjenesterne s rgede for at mine psyko emotio afl sninger blev erstattet med dine det var din egen receptivitetsgrad og konformitetsgrad du kiggede p tjenesterne har haft dig i s gelyset i lang tid du har jo ikke engang en emo fremkalder hjemme hos dig selv du forbinder dig aldrig til emo fremkalderen

1999932 it looks at first like any other shuttered storefront near the boardwalk some garish lettering and a cartoonish invitation to a delight or a scam in this case theres spongebob squarepants saying it dont gitmo better
1999933 in reflection of how critical it has become for the us military to retain native language and cultural know how in its ranks
1999934 never even said theres a link between al qaeda and iraq
1999935 obama cant point to a single instance in which sean hannity or talk radio
1999936 3 4 increase in single copy newsstand sales for the first half of 2008
1999937 the republican also has pulled ahead on the issue of balancing the federal budget
1999938 in contrast if anything pews respondents said they want to hear more not less about the republican candidate just 26 in the poll said they had heard too much about mccain while a larger number 38 reported that they had heard too little about the putative republican candidate
1999939 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
1999940 the activities of many organizations of the civil rights era
1999941 dr kings type of resistance to the u s version of apartheid could surely be considered homegrown terrorism
1999942 supreme arbiters of which ideas parties and candidates are permitted to effectively compete in the public arena
1999943 our politics has gotten so ah nasty thats the word i was looking for
1999944 but not just nasty also cynical and manipulative right so im happy to have a battle of words because ive got facts on my side
1999945 ive got truth on my side i fear no man when ive got truth on my side
1999946 we have sensed a lack of enthusiasm from the obama camp
1999947 stephanopoulos a gentleman named william ayers he was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that can you explain your relationship to him for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
1999948 in may when a mccain adviser proposed a series of pre convention appearances at town hall meetings obama said i think thats a great idea obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
1999949 there is an image right there in that very beginning of the leaning tower of pisa and there is an image of the washington monument
1999950 have you seen the paris hilton campaign video responding john mccain
1999951 will not run ads that are damaging to oil companies
1999952 there may be no corporation in america that has attacked the rights of workers and undercut the living standards of americans more than wal mart
1999953 write to every member of congress declaring that any democrat receiving or keeping wal mart money can kiss any labor donations or labor support good bye
1999954 what we need today is an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones we need to reduce the tax burden on businesses that choose to make their home in the united states of america we need to open new markets to u s products and we need to reduce the cost of healthcare and we need to end the out of control spending in washington that is putting our debt on the backs of our children
1999955 indicates his party is seriously considering another shutdown threat to force a vote on offshore oil drilling in september
1999956 the precise maneuvering of a shutdown threat is complicated but it revolves around the fact that key government spending bills expire when the fiscal year ends september 30 and congress must vote next month to keep the government operating
1999957 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
1999958 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1999959 in the western world journalists can mostly say what they want as long as they agree with the positions of their publishers
1999960 will defend their corporate right to speak but not mine nor that of any other independent journalist
1999961 there are many advantages of being printed by the sun
1999962 its big modern presses allow us to print six sections instead of four to print many more pages to have more color to print more quickly to do more zoning and to have better inserting
1999963 if the roll call of the states is conducted she might might still win
1999964 it is unlikely a running mate will be selected before the candidate returns from a weeks holiday in hawaii which starts this friday that leaves about 10 days until the start of the democratic party convention in denver
1999965 in addition to michelle obama the candidates inner circle consists of just three people david axelrod his senior strategist david plouffe his campaign manager and robert gibbs a senior adviser all three are intensely loyal and discreet obama professionals
1999966 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
1999967 one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain mr
1999968 behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 obama bundlers fund raisers who have each collected contributions totaling 50 000 or more many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington nearly three dozen of the bundlers have raised more than 500 000 each including more than a half dozen who have passed the 1 million mark and one or two who have exceeded 2 million according to interviews with fund raisers
1999969 i firmly disagree that a racial reading of chozicks story is ridiculous and i would counter that any failure on chozicks part to recognize such is just a wee bit clueless
1999970 if youve got michelle as first lady and malia and sasha running around on the south lawn that changes how america looks at itself
1999971 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1999972 if barack obama draws bigger crowds lets have more obama coverage
1999973 the current outsized attention obamas getting notably the three tv networks anchoring their news coverage from his recent international tour seems a market savvy response to audience interest

1999975 is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol

1999977 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as first lady and miss buffalo chip
1999978 bush seemed carefree as he spoke about the books he was reading the work he was doing on his nearby ranch his love of hot weather jogging his golf game and his 55th birthday
1999979 nbc nightly news devoted more than two minutes out of its total of 22 minutes or so of news time to this story
1999980 we are at war the economy is in the tank no one can afford gas in the tank but two minutes was given to this mouse research
1999981 my status has not changed although in a technical way it has i am on call to the editor of the post when they deem that they need reporting and editing from me
1999982 obviously were not the first newspaper to be affected by the continuing downturn in advertising
1999983 we are hopeful that by opting for our employees to voluntarily sign up for buyouts we can avoid any type of layoffs going forward
1999984 the position has been a very valuable part of the newspaper but i felt the need to move the resource to another area i didnt think we should weaken the editorial voice of the newspaper
1999985 given the cutbacks planned at the js i was told they could no longer justify having a full time editorial cartoonist although im taking the buyout im not going willingly im being forced out
1999986 playgirl is going all web the last print issue will be the jan feb 2009 magazine which comes out nov 18

1999988 felling i wish that we would see some accountability where if somebody gets it right you know they get a little bit more airtime in the fall but if somebody gets it wrong they are grounded
1999989 np i wanted to convey to women they can do anything if they know the power and keep the faith the power is within them the faith is within them too so its about themselves they should be themselves have confidence in that
1999990 back in the 1990s your incomes grew by 6 000 and over the last several years theyve actually fallen by nearly 1 000
1999991 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1999992 a well designed mechanism can impose a fee on a small share of these windfall profits without affecting incentives for oil companies and without affecting the price of oil barack obama will require oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to provide direct relief worth 500 for an individual and 1 000 for a married couple
1999993 the truth is that mccains campaign has received 1 33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry not 2 million
1999994 we find the 2 million figure is based on a mistaken calculation
1999995 cheney has not sought a speaking slot at the convention nor has his staff sought a role for him at the convention
1999996 the vice president has a great deal of respect for john mccain and as of last friday was out campaigning for him
1999997 claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
1999998 was designed to portray a false link between husseins regime and al qaeda as a justification for the iraq war
1999999 well publish apolitical pieces explicitly conservative and libertarian pieces and even an occasional left of center piece
