8650000 yes a date with you sounds lovely but to be frank from the outset wed prefer it if you didnt pee on us spit in our face jab sounds up our shame hose attach jumper cables to our nipples mummify us in duct tape or punch us in the stomach likewise were unenthusiastic about the prospect of feeling your fist up our oopsie hole wearing diapers having our family jewels tethered to a cinder block with piano wire pooping in your mouth eating kibbles and bits pretending were a naughty plumber or masquerading as some sad leather queen although that last ones not a deal breaker

8650005 one of my earliest memories was being in that hospital my dad always at our side
8650006 my brother and i not the senate were all he cared about he said that delaware can get another senator my boys cant get another father
8650007 we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they try
8650008 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8650009 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8650010 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8650011 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8650012 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8650013 now after six long years the administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8650014 hes done a lot for working class people and he has a lot of great foreign policy experience
8650015 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8650016 lets declare together with one voice right here right now barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8650017 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since
8650018 has convinced me that barack obama is the man for the job
8650019 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8650020 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8650021 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8650022 its great to have a friend who appreciates an earnest discussion of ideas

8650091 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

8650121 persecuted bullied threatened attacked or injured by others prior to the incident
8650122 bullying followed by a desire for revenge may therefore be a key dynamic behind many targeted school killings
8650123 without the desire for revenge its hard to imagine that troubled gang involved or gun obsessed teens would respond to bullying with lethal violence
8650124 ignore the desire for revenge and you miss a big part of the puzzle in many cases the biggest part
8650125 the desire for revenge isnt a disease to which certain unfortunate people fall prey
8650126 instead its a universal trait of human nature crafted by natural selection that exists today because it was adaptive in the ancestral environment in which the human species evolved
8650127 by creating the public perception that the nation had been victimized by unprovoked sneak attacks and that swift retaliatory action with overwhelmingly destructive force was the only rational and self interested course the country could take
8650128 served important functions for ancestral humans and its still capable of serving many of those important functions today
8650129 if we can better appreciate the naturalness of revenge the functions revenge arose to serve and the factors that elicit the motivation to seek revenge well be better equipped to change the world so that revenge becomes less destructive and less common
8650130 similar passions affections and emotions even the more complex ones such as jealousy suspicion emulation gratitude and magnanimity they practice deceit and are revengeful
8650131 the desire for revenge must have been effective in helping organisms to solve specific adaptive problems
8650132 today we may view revenge as a problem and it is but through the lens of evolution
8650133 this doesnt mean that the behavior is morally justified or that the tendency should be indulged
8650134 every employee manual should inform workers where they can go to complain when they are systematically harassed by a coworker or supervisor and human resources people need to look for resentful people carrying grudges
8650135 the capacity to forgive is every bit as authentic every bit as intrinsic to human nature and every bit as much a product of natural selection as is our penchant for revenge

8650151 the government is chalking out a plan to organise cultural evenings during the commonwealth games

8650153 the various venues discussed include nehru park connaught place central park red fort old fort firoz shah kotla ravindra bhawan humayuns tomb safdarjang tomb india gate and the games village
8650154 it was also considered that food courts could be organised to present cuisines of delhi the government would also consider illuminating historical buildings and other monuments the government wants to showcase indias cultural diversity and delhis composite culture

8650192 most want to track their actual fuel usage and spending some want to reduce their carbon footprint and then there is a growing group of small business owners who are using the site to help manage their fleet fuel costs
8650193 i think the idea for this site is really wonderful it is one of those things that seems so obvious to do it is surprising no one had before i guess things had to reach a point where people were just really paying attention to mileage
8650194 im constantly working on new ways to expose trends in the data finding ways to make the user interface smoother and growing the selection of reports available
8650195 the impact of higher gas prices on drivers accident severity and insurance costs is anything but simple
8650196 our findings indicate that higher average claim costs associated with lighter vehicles have the potential to offset to some extent whatever beneficial effects might occur from less driving its far too early to know how all these effects together will influence insurance claim costs

8650200 the initial agreement has been signed and we are waiting to see the approval of both governments
8650201 this trend holds great potential for us as an automotive supplier and provider of environmentally friendly drive technologies
8650202 the vast majority of car drivers across those countries have realised that conventional fuels such as diesel and petrol will become even more expensive in the future
8650203 in the near future all motorists will adjust their driving behaviour when faced with increasing fuel costs in the end the british have to as well
8650204 urban and short route drivers can reduce their energy consumption by more than 25 percent using hybrid drives while also reducing co2 emissions
8650205 there is a tremendous potential for hybrid cars in the uk
8650206 our task is to highlight the additional benefits of alternative drives and to emphasize the added value for the motorist and the environment
8650207 these results show that acting in an environmentally friendly way is also cost efficient
8650208 the purchase cost alone should not be the decisive criterion and must be viewed long term especially where hybrid technologies and drives will bring significant savings for motorists who drive mainly in urban traffic
8650209 this is just where hybrid drives perform best and really stand out
8650210 we have continued to cut costs and improve the responsiveness of our operations
8650211 unfortunately the rapid and accelerating decline of sales in the motor home industry during the first quarter caused heavy operating losses that were exacerbated by an aggressive discounting environment and downtime at our plants while the travel trailer division also had a loss quarter its performance was improved over the prior year the housing group remained profitable despite the challenging environment in that industry
8650212 we are experiencing some of the toughest industry conditions that we have seen since the late 1970s and early 1980s
8650213 dealers are reducing their inventories significantly and manufacturers orders are considerably below the dealers weak retail sales rates considering the current business climate we are pleased with the turnout indicated for our rv national dealer meeting next week we will be showcasing our newest products with innovative floor plans and exciting decor packages although we expect dealers to remain cautious for the foreseeable future we are eager to demonstrate to them why fleetwood remains an excellent choice as their business partner going forward
8650214 we believe that once the excess inventory of site built housing begins to clear the prospects for manufactured housing should improve
8650215 also the housing bill recently passed by congress contains several positives for our industry which should continue to narrow the gap between site built and manufactured housing lending practices we expect the difficult environment to continue for at least a couple more quarters however as shipments continue to lag throughout the country particularly in the retirement states of california arizona and florida in the meantime our trendsetter modular division has substantially completed two military contracts at fort bliss and fort sill and is in advanced stages of negotiations for additional similar contracts we have received positive feedback on our involvement to date and we expect to continue to participate in the armys military housing renovation plans
8650216 business conditions are expected to remain challenging at least through our third fiscal quarter resulting in losses and negative operating cash flows for fleetwood through that same period
8650217 we continue to aggressively pursue cost reductions and carefully manage production and inventories while still investing in new and improved products based on customer feedback
8650218 despite a modest but unavoidable build up of motor home chassis and finished goods inventories in the first quarter cash and marketable investments totaled 85 7 million at july 27 2008 with virtually no borrowings on our revolving credit facility
8650219 since then we have raised an additional 26 5 million from real estate financing a successful refinancing of the 5 debentures is the next step in our strategy to put fleetwood in a position of strength relative to current economic conditions and posture the company for an advantageous future we believe in the long term strength and viability of both our industries and look forward to continuing our participation as a leader in each as the markets recover

8650233 there is a huge market for family focused games particularly for girls in the six to 12 age range and we expect our hand picked titles to stand out at retail due to unique positioning and strong licensed endorsements

8650238 we wanted to create a news aggregating site where its just as simple as clicking on the logos of your favourite websites its for mainstream news readers not early adopters or techies
8650239 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment

8650245 weve taken a unit of work and linked it all together
8650246 our aim is to make it make fun engaging and educational
8650247 my favourite experiment was the hovercraft where you use a balloon with a cd and they spin
8650248 our class has actually been doing science for some time
8650249 you have to sticky tape metal to metal and then the lights comes on like this
8650250 it really lets the kids construct their own understanding and age is no barrier to what they can do
8650251 its kids teaching kids and how to learn in kids language
8650252 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8650253 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8650254 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics

8650257 the long answer is well ive lived in the philly area for most of my life and i know it well maybe too well so i figure nows my chance to get to know somewhere else l a is sunny and theres good vegetarian food
8650258 not only because people seemed to really appreciate it but because talking to farmers was like some kind of therapy so nice and relaxing made me want to quit journalism and become a farmer
8650259 im hoping california is like one big headhouse market everywhere you look fruits and veggies even if its not that way im going to have a little yard out there and i plan to start a garden so i will send you a tomato and you can decide
8650260 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
8650261 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
8650262 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
8650263 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
8650264 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
8650265 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
8650266 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
8650267 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
8650268 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
8650269 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
8650270 clinton is the first woman to run for this prestigious office
8650271 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8650272 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8650273 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush

8650276 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8650277 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8650278 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
8650279 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
8650280 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
8650281 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
8650282 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
8650283 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
8650284 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks
8650285 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
8650286 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
8650287 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
8650288 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
8650289 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8650290 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8650291 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8650292 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8650293 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8650294 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8650295 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8650296 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
8650297 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8650298 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
8650299 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
8650300 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8650301 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
8650302 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8650303 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
8650304 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
8650305 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8650306 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8650307 the next six months are going to tell the story
8650308 geez if we didnt follow orders we would have been shot and killed on the spot
8650309 geez if we dont follow orders we wont get paid
8650310 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
8650311 you got brained does that mean you need some brain food
8650312 yeah i got brained reeeal bad i need brain food quick
8650313 im super stoked to be on board the crew at porters is all about having a good time and sharing their passion of tahoe and snowboarding
8650314 we couldnt be more stoked on such a dynamic individual who is down to earth willing to work hard and be inspirational to all those young kids out there who want to have fun snowboarding
8650315 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8650316 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8650317 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8650318 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8650319 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8650320 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8650321 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8650322 bern unlimited have been at the cutting edge of head protection design for only three years but their unique approach both technical look and market position has taken the market by storm atila network is really excited to be given this opportunity and already the buzz has started
8650323 the addition of atila network to our sales and distribution team in the france will be invaluable with such extensive distribution sales and production experience in the action sport industry we feel very comfortable that we have a committed and solid partner to distribute our cutting edge head protection
8650324 what were going to try and do is some product will be ground up and be able to use and make some decking and other composite materials that may be useful as opposed to filling landfills
8650325 i bet i can get on top of the dresser faster than you can
8650326 oh look the monitor has a light lets go get it
8650327 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8650328 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8650329 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8650330 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8650331 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8650332 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
8650333 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8650334 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8650335 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8650336 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8650337 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8650338 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8650339 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8650340 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8650341 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8650342 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8650343 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8650344 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8650345 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8650346 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8650347 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8650348 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8650349 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8650350 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8650351 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8650352 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8650353 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8650354 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8650355 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8650356 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8650357 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8650358 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8650359 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8650360 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8650361 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8650362 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8650363 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8650364 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8650365 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8650366 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8650367 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8650368 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral candidate mccain criticizes senator mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8650369 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8650370 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8650371 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8650372 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8650373 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8650374 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8650375 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8650376 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8650377 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
8650378 the competition between the pirates and the ninjas is so huge that battles are breaking out all over
8650379 were happy to bring this grand conflict to the wii and give players the chance to help determine who the ultimate champions are

8650394 the older workers and retirees i study would like to do something meaningful or just make connections with people
8650395 they cant find flexible jobs though and they dont want to work full time anymore they dont see the kinds of situations they want
8650396 flexibility is not just about the number of hours you work but about having control over your time
8650397 the type of work you do and the organization you work in can increase that control even if youre working full time
8650398 in the early 1900s adolescence was identified as a new stage of life and a whole group of programs were created for that
8650399 we need to help social sector employers nonprofits government and others become aware create pathways and training programs for individuals and help individuals find ways to hook up with employers
8650400 when youre on a mission and you find something thats working and you develop it you have a different kind of energy its a passion
8650401 not many people today can sustain themselves on retirement income and social security
8650402 employers need good experienced passionate candidates people in encore careers are a potential talent pool with ability commitment and a passion to do the work they can help make the world a better place
8650403 i like to think that im nowhere near guy ritchie as i said before guy ritchie makes plastic gangster films he writes about characters that kind of like are a caricature whereas mine are real characters they are actually london boys theyre robbing a bank

8650417 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8650418 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8650419 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8650420 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8650421 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8650422 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8650423 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8650424 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8650431 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8650432 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8650433 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8650434 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8650435 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8650436 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8650437 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8650450 il y a certains pays europ ens qui proposeront des sanctions dautres qui les refuseront
8650451 nous essayons d laborer un texte fort signifiant notre volont de ne pas accepter
8650452 rien nest plus important que lunit face un probl me aussi grave rien ne serait plus dommageable que de sortir de la r union de lundi sans une unit non pas de fa ade mais une unit politique r elle

8650458 thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8650459 see hillary didnt say that obama is ready to lead because hes not nyah nyah
8650460 the world has always been more impressed by the power of our example than the example of our power
8650461 oh now this puts his vice presidential status in context
8650462 pc tools is a global leader in innovative software products designed to protect the privacy and security of windows computer users
8650463 barr on colbert so close to a discussion about global warming but no cigar
8650464 it was when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8650465 is just helping people get set up in the morning
8650466 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama i just liked how many people had their signs up
8650467 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8650468 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8650469 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8650470 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life
8650471 if george w bush was seeking re election wed be 20 points ahead
8650472 in arizona the only way to get around is by small private plane
8650473 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
8650474 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
8650475 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
8650476 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8650477 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8650478 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8650479 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8650480 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8650481 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8650482 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8650483 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8650484 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8650485 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8650486 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8650487 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8650488 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8650489 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8650490 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8650491 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8650492 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8650493 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8650494 in the most recent poll i am ahead by a commanding 1 percent
8650495 right now we are holding a majority by the skin of joe liebermans teeth
8650496 and president obama is going to need a working majority in the senate
8650497 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8650498 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8650499 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8650500 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8650501 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8650502 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8650503 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8650504 this really takes it another step by making it a settlement agreement that should have an impact across the industry
8650505 this landmark agreement sets a new industrywide precedent that will force companies to disclose the true financial risks that climate change poses to their investors
8650506 coal fired power plants can significantly contribute to global warming and investors have the right to know all the associated risks
8650507 we previously provided detailed information concerning the expected impact of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions regulations on our operations and under this agreement we will make even more detailed disclosures
8650508 this agreement will enhance our already aggressive efforts to be responsible environmental stewards
8650509 utility lobbies are very strong but they have read the writing on the wall in terms of greenhouse gas reductions
8650510 they know it is extremely popular with the public and so they have wanted to get ahead of the curve so they can have some input
8650511 the first meters are active and two way communication between the customer and the utility company is a reality
8650512 located about 8 miles north of hilo on the big island of hawaii the facility will draw on residual wood from the local timber industry and other biomass wastes to produce enough power for about 18 000 homes meeting up to 10 of the big islands electricity needs
8650513 estou satisfeito por o plano ter sido aprovado em conselho de ministros agora s espero que n o haja atrasos nos minist rios
8650514 foram definidos como objecto de interven o 59 projectos de iniciativa do governo e 61 da iniciativa dos munic pios
8650515 penso que com as obras que pedi o concelho ficar de alguma forma compensado pelos preju zos e tamb m espero ter verbas do munic pio para poder comparticipar os projectos
8650516 james degale is rank rotten he beat the worst cuban i have ever seen the guy had no boxing ability whatsoever shows the mediocrity of olympic boxing nowadays the ukrainian and felix diaz are good enough the rest should just forget it harrison khan and now degale they will make their money but they are limited and overated pro boxing is an entirely differnt animal

8650518 i agree with so many of you but particularly with
8650519 tell this headline to every uneducated person from a third world or
8650520 let this limited children initiative start with the third world countries and the islamic families that are currently trying to out produce the rest of us in order to take over
8650521 i wish i had know this before we had three
8650522 as usual another bible thumper that cannot offer proof to back up his beliefs
8650523 to muttonhead31 since you asked i will respond by repeating myself look around you
8650524 that mountain is not really there everyone is just imagining it
8650525 mixdown it is not a personal attack it is math
8650526 to mixdown you believe there is a god and thats what this country is all about but show me the proof that u speak of
8650527 about the argument over being frugal with resources in having more than two kids
8650528 to the jackal if you cant find proof that god exists then you are blind
8650529 wowsers this from scientists that are generally left of center politically and all in favor of the usa becoming north mexico in a few years
8650530 i recently saw a item on this on pbs and was shocked at how soon this is goign to become a global problem
8650531 i cant believe that people get so up in arms about the suggestion that they not have huge families i have chosen not to have kids and am regularly attacked for the decision by people who do choose to have them
8650532 charlie hustle you should run for president on that platform
8650533 in america we have generations of welfare recipients who beleive the more kids you have the more the government will reward you so why would they ever stop having children besides how else would the women be able to buy those new 24
8650534 i myself have only two children but i resent the premise of these arguments
8650535 it is about time someone took this thought process public in a more aggressive manner
8650536 well they ought to do this they ought to do that
8650537 vi lever p marginalen och tittar j ttemycket p priset
8650538 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8650539 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8650540 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8650541 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8650542 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8650543 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8650544 its a very good use of their excess capital and an important step in the road to recovery
8650545 this is the third largest writer of municipal bond insurance and its been reduced to junk status
8650546 and now ostensibly we assume and hope that its being upgraded to mbias rating the synergy in turn will help mbia because the agreement is bringing them a tremendous capital base
8650547 all i can do is be me whoever that is
8650548 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8650549 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8650550 thinking it through is the last thing an ideologue wants to do
8650551 what the hell kind of church has no beliefs no creed unitarianism or whatever you call it isnt any kind of religion
8650552 ah but its the best kind its pure its inclusive it is welcoming and nonjudgmental we have our values but we dont insist on any particular beliefs in god we know that there are many roads to rome many ways to skin the cat many paths for different travelers to insist on only one way and further to insist that that one way is the best and the only way for everyone and if a person doesnt follow that way he she is going to hell doesnt fit any idea of god that uus can imagine why be so limiting
8650553 with all do respect unless you accept jesus christ as your lord and savior and become born again you are going to hell
8650554 do you really think your jesus is sending me to hell
8650555 unitarian universalists believe in the free and responsible search for truth and meaning and if that is what you honestly believe and think it is a responsible position for you and your church to take then i respect it even if i dont agree with it
8650556 jest zbyt wcze nie by to powiedzie nie wiem jaki ostatecznie b dzie wynik
8650557 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8650558 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8650559 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8650560 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8650561 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8650562 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8650563 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8650564 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8650565 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8650566 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8650567 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8650568 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8650569 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8650570 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8650571 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8650572 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8650573 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8650574 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8650575 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8650576 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8650577 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8650578 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8650579 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8650580 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8650581 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8650582 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8650583 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8650584 je pense que je suis plus en phase avec le peuple am ricain en ce qui concerne ma politique mes propositions et mes id es a t il ajout
8650585 eu leaders are considering sanctions and many other means against russia over the georgia crisis french foreign minister bernard kouchner has said but he said he hoped the matter would be solved by negotiation moscows military action in georgia and its recognition of independence for rebel regions has angered the west russias foreign minister described talk of sanctions which correspondents say mr kouchner ruled out earlier this week as an emotional response that demonstrated western confusion over the situation
8650586 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
8650587 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
8650588 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet

8650590 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8650591 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8650592 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8650593 if she doesnt call shes just not that into you
8650594 nunca imaginamos llegar a europa gracias a nuestro trabajo espero que esta no sea la nica vez es muy dif cil por enfrentarnos m s que a los rivales a un p blico nuevo
8650595 la gente tiene una idea muy diferente de lo que es la lucha libre creen que es una farsa pero la prueba de lo contrario son las lesiones de muchos de mis compa eros
8650596 ellos fueron los m s aparatosos pero todos estamos mal yo tengo los codos inflamados dami n tiene las piernas hinchadas por los golpes en fin todos estamos lastimados pero a n as estamos presentes al pie del ca n todo con el fin de dejar en el mejor lugar a la lucha libre mexicana

8650598 esto feliz la gente aqu es muy diferente a la de jap n que ya visit en dos ocasiones creo que el futuro de la lucha libre en este pa s es muy bueno

8650600 we have studied this in mice but it has naturally been difficult to do so in humans now we have had an opportunity to examine such transplants in an individual with type 1 diabetes
8650601 we previously know that amyloid production is a symptom of stress that leads to cell death in type 2 diabetes perhaps the same thing happens in a transplant when cells are exposed to great stress
8650602 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme

8650604 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8650605 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8650606 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8650607 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8650608 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8650609 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8650610 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8650611 ive been flicking the bean in the net for a while now but no one wants to give me a chance
8650612 i just want a chance to hop in my canoe and row my way to the nhl
8650613 but they simply wanted to deny my one pleasure in this world

8650619 ever posee una extraordinaria calidad como jugador pues maneja el bal n con criterio y estamos convencidos de que ser muy importante para el grupo
8650620 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8650621 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8650622 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8650623 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8650624 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8650625 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8650626 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8650627 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8650628 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8650629 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8650630 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8650631 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8650632 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8650633 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8650634 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8650635 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8650636 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8650637 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8650638 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8650639 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8650640 no my life is not better off in fact it is worse
8650641 i dont use liberal talking points i excrete liberal talking points
8650642 i dont use liberal talking points i create liberal talking points
8650643 he also says listing to his one sided rhetoric that comes to you via radio station filled with one sided propagandist looking to get rich by blindly riding off his coattail
8650644 calypso you speak like a true mind numbed liberal i am going to address your point bullet by bullet
8650645 you talk of how the cia tortures prisoners and yet say nothing of how our people have been tortured and murdered i guess it is not ok to merely waterboard a terrorist who by the way is not subject to the protection of the geneva convention but it is ok to be beheaded by a rusty and dull sword
8650646 do our people get that and what about abu graib do you know what those photos look like saturday night and ted kennedys oh the poor terrorist had to wear panties on his head boo hoo
8650647 show me the proof of the thousands upon thousands of dead civilians that were murdered by saddam just because some code pink moonbat says it doesnt mean it is true please provide any credible report
8650648 an excess mortality of nearly 100 000 deaths was reported in iraq for the period march 2003 september 2004 attributed to the invasion of iraq
8650649 i take it then you were for the surpeme court decision to upholding the decision to negate the dc ban on handguns i mean hey they were protecting the second amendment
8650650 at this point in the war name me all the people affected by the patriot act that were unfairly targeted by the patriot act i bet if bill clinton had wanted the patriot act youd have loved it
8650651 and what is that other than the fact that you hate bush
8650652 force may be used only in a truly just cause and solely for that purpose correcting a suffered wrong is considered a right intention while material gain or maintaining economies is not
8650653 just war conduct should be governed by the principle of minimum force
8650654 were you for or against the war in kosovo and why
8650655 when did this happen i mean in the last ten years bush never did this
8650656 show us the proof why this was pure conjecture there is proof that the military votes were infringed according to the fec
8650657 was that bushs fault what did he do or not do what did the local people do or not do did you know that there was a plan to reinforce the levees and when it came time to do so the environmentalists filed a lawsuit against the army corp of engineers and won thus repventing any more work from happening did you know that instead of using the federal money they got to improve the bilge pumps new orleans officials built a casino the locals had ample changes to either help prevent problems or get people out and they did nothing and they are democrats one and all
8650658 ahhh the swift boat attacks oh boo hoo i have yet to see john kerry sue any of those men for slander or release his military records compared to some of the filth i have seen posted against bush i would say kerry had it easy he could dish it out but he couldnt take it please do find a single thing the swift boat veterans said that wasnt true and post back
8650659 who cares i do give a crap if he unites us or not i want him to follow and implements the republican platform i take it the messiah will unite us wioh that extremely liberal racord fat chance
8650660 what science global warming that isnt science they have proven nothing there is no proof just conjecture they used phony data and no scientific method to prove their claims just alot of bullying tactics alternative energy has been around for 30 years and is has gotten no where nuclear is alernative energy can we use that
8650661 so what he has kept us and you safe id rather have him than some phony who reads a teleprompter well but has no orgininal thought
8650662 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8650663 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8650664 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8650665 with the internet with cable with the 15 000 journalists that we have here so many more people can experience it
8650666 being here on the ground to be part of that kind of change is something im glad is televised
8650667 its about developing the skills and developing the intellect and it teaches you how to be competitive
8650668 its being among all these democrats you know everybody thinks the way you think you can get into a conversation about things that are important for you and know youre not going to get into a confrontation
8650669 if youre a guest you cant sit in these seats
8650670 all i can say is that im sorry for his death and im sorry for his parents
8650671 the japanese government strongly deplores all kinds of terrorist activities and heinous criminal acts such as kidnapping and murder and we renew our determination to fight terrorism
8650672 i also feel that as others in the international community are making brave sacrifices to continue their efforts to bring peace and reconstruction to afghanistan japan too must continue to do whatever it can
8650673 all our family members have agreed that we will collect him from an airport in japan
8650674 with the bcm3556 our dtv design partners can expand the use of broadcom socs to address european and asian markets
8650675 by providing additional worldwide standards in our dtv product line along with differentiated features to tv manufacturers our design partners in turn can offer viewers greater connectivity and enhanced interactivity
8650676 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8650677 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8650678 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8650679 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8650680 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
8650681 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8650682 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
8650683 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8650684 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways
8650685 humans and other large mammals primates and large carnivores like tigers for example exist in cluttered environments like forests or jungles and their eyes have evolved to point in the same direction
8650686 i have taped the 217 possible causes of the victims death on this wall who wants to throw the dart so we can get the paperwork rolling

8650701 this is the most significant most violent and most long lasting of all the financial crises we have had since the second world war
8650702 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8650703 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8650704 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8650705 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8650706 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8650707 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8650708 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing

8650713 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends

8650716 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8650717 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8650718 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8650719 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies

8650730 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8650731 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8650732 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8650733 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8650734 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8650735 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8650736 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8650737 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8650738 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8650739 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations

8650748 it brought back memories of my childhood in ohio where the klan still marched when racism was overt all the name calling i and my family had to endure
8650749 those kinds of characters were very common and id like to see some sensitivity on the part of the county administration to do something about it

8650789 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

8650855 as soon as the latter came out of my mouth my right arm was twisted violently behind my back and i was informed that i was being escorted out of the stadium
8650856 i was sitting in the tier level and of course this is the highest level of the stadium and i was escorted in this painful manner down the entire length of the stadium
8650857 when we reached the exit of the stadium they confiscated my ticket and the first officer shoved me through the turnstiles saying get the hell out of my country if you dont like it
8650858 nowhere on the yankee stadium ticket policy nor on any posted sign does it say that forced patriotism is a required element to attend a baseball game nowhere in the laws of this country would that begin to be defensible

8650871 the open competition attracted an extremely high level of interest we are confident that each of the four finalists will develop ideas which will challenge our perceptions of the site and excite and inspire local communities commuters and londoners as well as the international audiences who know and visit the south bank
8650872 this project is crucial in terms of linking the riverside area which is largely regenerated with the rest of waterloo and blackfriars which is still in need of major investment and public realm improvement
8650873 ooh this so soft my n gga this just makes me horny my n gga lets go find some hoes
8650874 what has worked for croydon can work for southwark and lambeth
8650875 we can learn a lot from the croydon tram experience and this will ensure the cross river tram is even more successful
8650876 the tram is rapid reliable and green we need to be really imaginative in developing new ways of funding the cross river tram project and getting the mayor and the government signed up to it
8650877 the tram is vital to regenerating peckham and brixton linking southwark and lambeth to the city westminster and camden
8650878 business has benefited so much in croydon that developers paid for a new tram stop the visit today gave us confidence that what has worked so well for croydon can work for southwark and lambeth
8650879 clearly this is a very significant financial deal for asterand we are happy that allergan has decided to carry our prostaglandin program forward after evaluating it under an exclusive material transfer agreement allergan has the expertise reputation and resources to potentially turn these compounds into effective treatments for diseases of the eye especially glaucoma
8650880 our revitalised commercial team is leveraging increasing demand by broadening our relationships with large pharmaceutical and biotech companies in order to become more of an integrated partner in the early stages of the drug discovery process
8650881 nobody thought we would be arguing with fema for three years over the damage to that hospital
8650882 were going to push for a resolution on this but we feel strongly about this number
8650883 its clear that charity was hurting prior to the storm
8650884 but fema is not in a position consistent with the stafford act to repair those kinds of decrepit conditions that existed prior to the storm
8650885 if the state had initiated repair work immediately or a month or two after the storm i think its safe to say the repairs would have been effective
8650886 it was obvious that the relationships with fema had broken down to a point where it was very unproductive
8650887 its like they dont trust us that were trying to beat the system and we really arent
8650888 pretty much throughout this disaster thats how femas treated us
8650889 we know people are going to drive we want them in their cars for less time
8650890 i believe in local control i come from a city council
8650891 but traffic congestion doesnt all of a sudden go from bad to good when you cross any particular city or county border and air quality and climate challenges dont respect artificial boundaries
8650892 most people dont want to live in dense urban cores most people want a little elbow room they want a yard for their children to play in
8650893 they want a little grass a little garden a little breathing room they can call their own and who the hell are you to tell people they cant
8650894 its either going to be some regulation restricting your behavior or some huge tax and neither of those is politically popular
8650895 so theres been a big debate about whether we can do this all with carrots
8650896 ive spent most of my 30 year career fighting regional planning and regional government
8650897 but what you are seeing here is a pretty thoughtful approach there are incentives for in fill development and building along transportation corridors and in the end it doesnt prevent development in suburban areas it just says there are standards and it has to be done well
8650898 in order to have affordable housing you shouldnt have to live in tracy if you work in san jose
8650899 you should have a range of housing and transportation options
8650900 tying transportation funds to land use patterns is something people in sacramento have been talking about for 20 years
8650901 it is a big deal in california it is a necessary step and it was climate change that pushed it over the top
8650902 theyre throwing it out without considering the benefits of the program
8650903 some people have done it poorly and we all pay the price for programs done poorly
8650904 therell be something to take its place somewhere down the road
8650905 if its done well it can be a viable program
8650906 but they started to grow quickly and after a month there were two wings

8650910 if we see that again in 2008 i think that would a really strong indication that a difference really has been made among this 20 to 24 year old age group
8650911 but if this is what it takes this is what it takes cause its wrong and people are dying
8650912 the recall has been very large but in fact its entirely possible that only a small portion of the meat that was recalled was actually contaminated

8650928 for 15 months the 13th man buddi prasad gurung was held in iraq against his will before kbr and daoud allowed him to return home to nepal
8650929 it doesnt appear that any of them knew they were going to iraq

8650952 before reaching their homestead i saw busani had a firearm he said he was going to shoot sishi
8650953 i had my licensed firearm and i agreed to assist busani he told me to cover my firearm with a sock so that any shots i fired would not be traced back to me

8650959 my children took it very badly i had to literally sleep in a chair outside my sons bedroom because he started sleepwalking however as time went by everything calmed down
8650960 they never knew the true nature of our relationship nothing positive could come from their knowing i was involved with another man while married to their father
8650961 he was leaving me i went into complete shock when he moved in with me and the kids the romance suffered of course but we said that once we were married we would make up for lost time
8650962 after 12 years together the 12 best years of my life i never doubted him we were in love we had supported each other through so much including my becoming disabled due to a back injury i could never have imagined my life without him
8650963 i think he left me for someone else i only wish hed been man enough to tell me the truth the very least i deserved was honesty
8650964 despite all the hurt andy inflicted on us i still miss the good times
8650965 being homeless makes you feel worthless useless i prayed so hard for help the more unbearable things became the harder i prayed i didnt think i would survive but through my faith in jesus i did
8650966 the stable is where you learn to be in charge and not take sh t dressed to the occasion leather boots and a stiff black whip
8650967 the first thing i really noticed was at civic center park when i was in the food not bombs area
8650968 i was planning to march with the group that night we all had different reasons for being there
8650969 the group first gathered outside the city county building getting ready to march but the police blockaded us
8650970 we moved to the sidewalk a few people stayed in the street because we didnt want a confrontation but it didnt matter
8650971 people started pleading let me go i want to go home
8650972 we asked why we were being detained but they wouldnt talk to us they told us to sit down and we sat down
8650973 then they said that anyone with a photo i d could show it and be let out of the circle and anyone without i d would be arrested i saw a handful of people hold up their i d and police walked up to them grabbed them and took them out i dont know if they were arrested
8650974 they set up an arrest squad two police per protester and talked about who to pick get this one with the bandana or get that one in the black they were
8650975 the arrest process was the two officers picked you up searched you took your bag and everything except your money
8650976 then i was taken to another area loaded onto a bus that took us to a warehouse in a denver industrial park
8650977 they pumped in cold air in these big white tubes all night and all day the next day
8650978 eventually they put all of us in metal leg shackles and re handcuffed us in pairs with our right hands together right hand to right hand so it was difficult to move
8650979 after they shackled us they put us in a van with no windows and took us to the courthouse where we were supposed to speak with a judge to hear the charges against us we were still handcuffed right hand to right hand they took us in an elevator that went up to a jail cell and
8650980 the attorney explained we had three choices plead guilty and post a 300 bond 500 if you were from out of state or accept a plea bargain that dropped all the charges but one that you had to pay 141 for or plead not guilty and either post your own bail or wait in jail till your court date
8650981 then they walked us out of the courthouse and we saw another group from the protest walking in we were the first group to meet with a judge and a lawyer
8650982 then they took us back to the warehouse the only place to sleep was on a chair if you got one or on the concrete floor
8650983 i was really worried because i could not get any responses from the police
8650984 in the cells we talked to each other about where we were from the places wed been and if wed been in situations before
8650985 i got out on tuesday around noon we learned we were the first wave of protesters to make it all the way through the process 7 p m last night to noon today
8650986 shop and casino workers are among the most exploited overworked and underpaid employees especially the growing number whose jobs have been casualised
8650987 at a time when inflation is now officially at 13 percent and food inflation much higher than that all workers are suffering a severe cut in their standard of living and saccawu members are absolutely right to demand a living wage
8650988 since you know that the country is faced with these major activities i urge you to behave yourselves and make sure that you display respect so that tourists would return to the country
8650989 how could any juror not want to see this person removed from our list of living human beings how could you live with yourself as a juror if theres any chance this human being could escape from jail and do something like this again

8650993 con le dimissioni del presidente georgiano shevarnadze lopposizione filoamericana arrivata al potere a tbilisi questo fa parte di un disegno pi generale volto alla crescita dellinfluenza di washington nel caucaso disegno che avr tuttavia fatto suonare un campanello di allarme al cremlino i russi non se ne staranno con le mani in mano mentre una nazione chiave al suo confine meridionale passa direttamente nel campo dellimperialismo usa questi avvenimenti preparano la strada a conflitti ancora pi aspri ed alla disintegrazione della georgia i russi serreranno le fila in georgia le regioni cosiddette autonome ed i leaders filomoscoviti hanno troppa voglia di arrivare allo scontro con il nuovo governo di tbilisi
8650994 washington e mosca trattano le nazioni piccole deboli e divise del caucaso come pedine in un gioco dove lintera regione una gigantesca scacchiera

8650996 la russia era una prigione dei popoli una delle ragioni chiave nel successo della rivoluzione bolscevica era lapproccio sulla questione delle nazionalit lenin cap che lunico modo con cui costruire una nuova federazione socialista era quello di basarsi su una completa uguaglianza per tutte le minoranze nazionali non ci poteva essere costrizione di una nazione da parte di unaltra una repubblica socialista poteva costituirsi su base volontaria come lunione volontaria di nazionalit diverse di conseguenza il diritto delle nazioni allautodeterminazione era scritto nel vessillo del partito e della giovane repubblica dei soviet fino a includere la secessione lenin si batt per lunit dei popoli componenti limpero zarista ma doveva essere una unione volontaria fu per questo che egli insistette fin dallinizio sul diritto allautodeterminazione questa idea che viene spesso fraintesa come una richiesta di separazione completamente corretta i bolscevichi non incoraggiavano la separazione ma difendevano la pi ampia estensione possibile dellautodeterminazione nazionale fino ad includere la separazione nessuno ha il diritto di obbligare un popolo a vivere nei confini di uno stato quando la maggioranza non ci vuole stare ma il diritto allautodeterminazione non comporta la richiesta di una separazione pi di quanto il diritto al divorzio significhi che tutte le coppie devono dividersi o che il diritto allaborto significhi che tutte le gravidanze vanno interrotte

8650998 it was not marxs aim to discover the eternal laws of economy
8650999 the self sufficient economy of the primitive peasant family has no need of a political economy for it is dominated on the one hand by the forces of nature and on the other by the forces of tradition the self contained natural economy of the greeks or the romans founded on slave labour was ruled by the will of the slave owner whose plan in turn was directly determined by the laws of nature and routine the same might also be said about the mediaeval estate with its peasant serfs in all these instances economic relations were clear and transparent in their primitive crudity but the case of contemporary society is altogether different it destroyed the old self contained connections and the inherited modes of labour the new economic relations have linked cities and villages provinces and nations division of labour has encompassed the planet having shattered tradition and routine these bonds have not composed themselves to some definite plan but rather apart from human consciousness and foresight and it would seem as if behind the very backs of men the interdependence of men groups classes nations which follows from division of labour is not directed or managed by anyone people work for each other without knowing each other without inquiring about one anothers needs in the hope and even with the assurance that their relations will somehow regulate themselves and by and large they do or rather were wont to
8651000 this new epoch the national economy began about 3 000 years before our epoch when in the river valleys of the nile euphrates and tigris the indus and the huang ho a large quantity of people combined to tame the force of the rivers and use their water for their ends
8651001 trade and the private appropriation of the land lead to the domination of man by man
8651002 in the heroic age the four tribes of the athenians were still settled in attica in separate territories even the twelve phratries composing them seem still to have had distinct seats in the twelve towns of cecrops the constitution was that of the heroic age assembly of the people council of the people basileus as far as written history takes us back we find the land already divided up and privately owned which is in accordance with the relatively advanced commodity production and the corresponding trade in commodities developed towards the end of the upper stage of barbarism in addition to grain wine and oil were produced to a continually increasing extent the sea trade in the aegean was captured from the phoenicians and most of it passed into athenian hands through the sale and purchase of land and the progressive division of labour between agriculture and handicraft trade and shipping it was inevitable that the members of the different gentes phratries and tribes very soon became intermixed and that into the districts of the phratry and tribe moved inhabitants who although fellow countrymen did not belong to these bodies and were therefore strangers in their own place of domicile for when times were quiet each tribe and each phratry administered its own affairs without sending to athens to consult the council of the people or the basileus but anyone not a member of the phratry or tribe was of course excluded from taking any part in this administration even though living in the district
8651003 the key to the whole east is the absence of private property in land
8651004 how comes it that the orientals did not reach to landed property or feudalism i think the reason lies principally in the climate combined with the conditions of the soil especially the great desert stretches which reach from the sahara right through arabia persia india and tartary to the highest asiatic uplands artificial irrigation is here the first condition of cultivation and this is the concern either of the communes the provinces or the central government
8651005 if we analyse the economy and its history with respect to the totality of the principles which created its base we find only two archetypes the equivalent economy under which humanity has lived for almost 800 000 years from the beginning of its economic history and the non equivalent economy which approximately 6 000 years ago began to place the economy on a new base and which subjected the entire world to its system
8651006 the direct barter of products attains the elementary form of the relative expression of value in one respect but not in another
8651007 in the direct barter of products each commodity is directly a means of exchange to its owner and to all other persons an equivalent but that only in so far as it has use value for them
8651008 in proportion as exchange bursts its local bonds and the value of commodities more and more expands into an embodiment of human labour in the abstract in the same proportion the character of money attaches itself to commodities that are by nature fitted to perform the social function of a universal equivalent those commodities are the precious metals
8651009 do not acquire a value form independent of their own use value or of the individual needs of the exchangers
8651010 proudhon begins by taking his ideal of justice of justice ternelle from the juridical relations that correspond to the production of commodities thereby it may be noted he proves to the consolation of all good citizens that the production of commodities is a form of production as everlasting as justice then he turns round and seeks to reform the actual production of commodities and the actual legal system corresponding thereto in accordance with this ideal what opinion should we have of a chemist who instead of studying the actual laws of the molecular changes in the composition and decomposition of matter and on that foundation solving definite problems claimed to regulate the composition and decomposition of matter by means of the eternal ideas of naturalit and affinit do we really know any more about usury when we say it contradicts justice ternelle quit ternelle mutualit ternelle and other v rit s ternelles than the fathers of the church did when they said it was incompatible with gr ce ternelle foi ternelle and la volont ternelle de dieu
8651011 from this we may form an estimate of the shrewdness of the petit bourgeois socialism which while perpetuating the production of commodities aims at abolishing the antagonism between money and commodities and consequently since money exists only by virtue of this antagonism at abolishing money itself we might just as well try to retain catholicism without the pope
8651012 q is the economy of socialism of the 21st century then a barter economy
8651013 injustice exists when a product a is exchanged for a product b and their values the labour time necessary to produce each one of them are not equal that is to say when equivalents are not exchanged whether that exchange of unequal values unequal labour efforts is monetized that is to say whether it is expressed in monetary or natural form is secondary
8651014 it is justifiably criticised because it is not based upon nature but only exploitation together with it is found the business of usury which is hated for good reason because it obtains its profits from money itself and not from the things for the sale of which money was invented since the latter was only intended to facilitate exchange but interest means that this is multiplied by itself for this reason this type of gain is the one which is most directed against nature
8651015 among the ancients we discover no single enquiry as to which form of landed property etc is the most productive which creates maximum wealth wealth does not appear as the aim of production although cato may well investigate the most profitable cultivation of fields or brutus may even lend money at the most favourable rate of interest the enquiry is always about what kind of property creates the best citizens
8651016 woe to those who devise iniquity they covet fields and take them by violence also houses and seize them behold against this family i am devising disaster
8651017 i will destroy the winter house along with the summer house the houses of ivory shall perish and the great houses shall have an end
8651018 behold the days shall come upon you when he god will take you away with fishhooks and israel shall surely be led away captive
8651019 the trading nations of ancient times existed like the gods of epicurus in the intermediate worlds of the universe or rather like the jews in the pores of polish society the trade of the first independent flourishing merchant towns and trading nations rested as a pure carrying trade upon the barbarism of the producing nations between whom they acted the middleman
8651020 entirely just and legitimate reasons arise to demand something over and above the amount due on the contract
8651021 the discovery of america the rounding of the cape opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie the east indian and chinese markets the colonisation of america trade with the colonies the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally gave to commerce to navigation to industry an impulse never before known and thereby to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society a rapid development
8651022 the bourgeoisie by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production by the immensely facilitated means of communication draws all even the most barbarian nations into civilisation the cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all chinese walls with which it forces the barbarians intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate it compels all nations on pain of extinction to adopt the bourgeois mode of production it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst i e to become bourgeois themselves in one word it creates a world after its own image
8651023 the discovery of gold and silver in america the extirpation enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population the beginning of the conquest and looting of the east indies the turning of africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black skins signalised the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production these idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of primitive accumulation if money according to auger comes into the world with a congenital blood stain on one cheek capital comes dripping from head to foot from every pore with blood and dirt
8651024 it was not so much from slavery as through slavery that humanity was emancipated
8651025 along with the constantly diminishing number of the magnates of capital who usurp and monopolize all advantages of this process of transformation grows the mass of misery oppression slavery degradation exploitation but with this too grows the revolt of the working class a class always increasing in numbers and disciplined united organized by the very mechanism of the process of capitalist production itself the monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production which has sprung up and flourished along with and under it centralization of the means of production and socialization of labour at last reach a point where they become incompatible with their capitalist integument thus integument is burst asunder the knell of capitalist private property sounds the expropriators are expropriated
8651026 if state property were socialism we would already have had socialism in latin america at the time of king charles v because when the spanish monarchy arrived in america all the property in and beneath the land was the patrimony of the king but that was feudalism not socialism the only possible way is a mixed economy which will have three subjects the state private enterprise and social property like the cooperatives
8651027 because people will simple not accept it any more the option is therefore whether i go for developmentalism desarrollismo or try
8651028 the rule is jam yesterday jam tomorrow but never jam today
8651029 the project has a dual strategy of development developmentalism which is a social democratic way of development where the state utilizes its economic and legal powers to foment for example reindustrialization redistributes a big part of the wealth through pdvsa etc creates the welfare state alongside the rule of law state of right this leads to growth to an improvement of the material situation but the limit is that you do not go beyond the market economy no sales de la econom a de mercado and that means that i always live with the fear of losing my job one of the big gains of historical socialism was that there was no unemployment and that daily terror that you have to produce more and more because if not i will sack you disappears it is an extraordinary liberation
8651030 the mission of every enterprise is to generate profit or at least cover a social need and when people administer a good in an optimum way there will be no reason to change it
8651031 this is a complete nonsense that has been invented by heinz dieterich to cover his bare backside for if a capitalists are working for the common good not for profit and b are working efficiently why change anything to which we answer 1 leon trotsky introduction to
8651032 in some cases operators are charging you for a call of one minute two seconds what they can charge you for two minutes this leads to overcharging on average of 24 percent for calls made and 19 percent for calls received
8651033 the regulation of billing increments within the eurotariff or any other roaming tariff would amount to micro management and would risk further erosion of competitive differentiation in the market
8651034 billing increments are a point of differentiation that operators can use to appeal to customers with different preferences
8651035 this is an issue national regulators have recommended the european commission to address if you tackle this issue you have to tackle it in eu legislation this is something the european commission will consider in the weeks to come
8651036 its really a slam dunk if we keep our current primary system and its a very strong possibility if we move to a different primary system

8651041 this is the first study to show their parabens accumulation in human tissues it demonstrates that if people are exposed to these chemicals then the chemicals will accumulate in their bodies their detection in human breast tumours is of concern since parabens have been shown to be able to mimic the action of the female hormone estrogen estrogen can drive the growth of human breast tumours it would therefore seem especially prudent to consider whether parabens should continue to be used in such a wide range of cosmetics applied to the breast area including deodorants
8651042 it is welcome additional information and we will want to examine the findings in detail
8651043 we implore you to totally ignore any mail that claims you have won money in a lottery when in fact you never purchased a ticket for that particular lotto draw

8651061 all us vice presidents and above including howard schultz and the senior leadership team will receive no salary increases this fiscal year
8651062 ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8651063 we are going to see much more dramatic drops in output
8651064 the way to get out of it is to act by interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus and other things to try help people who are hurt through this
8651065 sitting by doing nothing is not going to get us out of this and hoping that a knight in shining armour will come and lift us out of this is optimistic in the extreme
8651066 when the markets look at which central bank is going to be the next one to reduce interest rates theyre probably looking to the bank of england before the federal reserve in the us before the european central bank and certainly before the bank of japan
8651067 so maybe thats why sterling is in the firing line because the interest rate advantage that has been there in sterling might not be there much longer

8651082 the battle will not be over what happened in selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of america it is the effort of american negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of american life

8651084 it was involved in businesses in south america that werent travelling the way they hoped and instead of revealing the true state of its business to the market it chose to fudge

8651101 age staff are passionate about their masthead and their readers and are disappointed that the managers of the company appear willing to sacrifice quality journalism for the sake of the bottom line
8651102 its not good for the paper not good for the journalists and not good for the communities they serve
8651103 people are worried about their futures and if they are going to have a job in a few weeks time
8651104 they wanted to signal to management they want to be involved and negotiated with and consulted by the company as to what plans management has for fairfax media rather than be treated dismissively and communicated to by email
8651105 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk

8651112 what my youngest brother cares most about as a diesel mechanic is that his kids are educated that theyre educated well and that he has some way to put his kids through college

8651116 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8651117 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8651118 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8651119 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8651120 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8651121 i would say this is the biggest response weve ever got from a campaign or a candidate
8651122 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our email boxes
8651123 he got into the files just yesterday so we wanted to have him on to find out what he found and if at all possible we wanted to get the obama campaign to get their side of the story
8651124 thats why the uproar is kind of amazing because we wanted the obama campaigns take as well
8651125 what is completely lacking in the obama campaigns statement is any refutation whatsoever of mr kurtzs
8651126 offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8651127 great food is like great sex the more you have the more you want
8651128 these rains will likely produce life threatening flash floods and mud slides
8651129 great food is like great sex the more you have the more you want
8651130 i think the reason for it the union criticism is that those individuals from one or two unions are locked into a view of equity which doesnt work
8651131 but i think weve got to put ancient debates behind us which are purely about throwing resources at one end of the system without measuring the results at the other end of the system
8651132 we are concerned that there is a group of communities a group of young australians who are in a grave grave danger of being left behind
8651133 plainly you are going to have some people in the unions who are going to go for us big time that is a matter for them
8651134 all we are seeking from the government is the evidence from experience in the us and the uk these are flawed models
8651135 ultimately in order to achieve the outcomes we want we need to ensure that our schools are properly funded
8651136 i dont support narrow league tables as they all too often distort both student progress and teacher achievement
8651137 but i dont think that is why the government is suggesting them either
8651138 as we make the consequences of the smuggling act harsher on the people doing it their resistance to being arrested is going to get higher and higher

8651152 it is my goal to create beauty in my paintings
8651153 i love to use bright vibrant colors to create a strong contrast of light and shadow my paintings attempt to capture an exact moment in time so the viewer feels as though he were present in the scene
8651154 to live with her work to spend time with a piece allows for a decided sensitivity to come through
8651155 the paintings are created on a wet surface with varying amounts of color melting together
8651156 a second layer highlights some elements from the first layer and obscures others some color is wiped away leaving traces behind on occasion i will outline the focal point or float lines of charcoal pencil to add organization to the chaos
8651157 cities towns and buildings are a telling extension of ourselves perhaps a portrait of humanity
8651158 you can see the good bad hopes dreams nightmares and ambitions of mankind through examining our urban footprint on the planet

8651160 few artists handle color as charmingly and supremely well as does mr geary he is extremely talented
8651161 my show entitled trials and trails is a combination of two main bodies of work in linoleum block print and mixed media that i have been working on over the past two years the first body of work is a comment on my southwest upbringing dealing with manifest destiny and the wild west on the other side of the spectrum is work dealing with relationships goals desires and milestones in life
8651162 the artists at the fiesta are a great expression of the diversity artistry and spirit of the community

8651165 i spent several years researching this book using an enormous body of documentation and im not about to denounce it just because it upsets a few people
8651166 describes the whole of maori society as violent and dangerous this is a clearly racist view claiming a whole ethnic group has these traits
8651167 besides sanctions he also said we will attack ukraine moldova and the crimea this is diseased imagination
8651168 france does not have a diseased imagination france was part of events in georgia and in russia where it fulfilled its work as european union president we do not want to halt the dialogue with russia absolutely not and france does not propose introducing sanctions
8651169 russian american tensions are high and any decision on the documents which will define further cooperation would be hasty and emotional in the current situation it would be best if the white house waits for the question to be depoliticized and assessed pragmatically
8651170 his best paintings preserve a moment of truth that makes them memorable and regretfully beautiful
8651171 years ago sedona enjoyed small town gatherings like the rodeo that was held each year as many of you know i have been very concerned about the loss of these small town events that bring us together in a spirit of fellowship it is my hope that this event will grow with time and become a sedona tradition
8651172 it is critical we have support for this effort to re create a sense of community in sedona with this festival
8651173 this music is sure to fill listeners with the spirit of the holidays

8651227 some areas of mangroves that provide breeding grounds for many fish species could be completely decimated
8651228 there is reason to believe that hoyo maru is leaking from her bunker which means there could be a lot more oil left to spill were hoping that japanese historians can help us to determine if she went down with a full tank so we can estimate the full scale of the threat
8651229 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocontact mariangela dacunto mariangela dacunto esa int 39 069 418 0856 european space agencysource eurekalert cean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8651230 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8651231 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice
8651232 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market
8651233 at this time justification for use of thiazolidinediones is very weak to non existent
8651234 further compound their already increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease
8651235 represent conditions that are major precursors of congestive heart failure
8651236 we reported in the journal diabetes care in june 2007 that thiazolidinediones doubled the risk of congestive heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes
8651237 the increased heart failure appears to be a class effect
8651238 the unfavorable findings from the three trials have not been fully realized by the medical community
8651239 safer cheaper and more effective treatment alternatives are available that do not carry these negative cardiovascular risks in patients with diabetes the rationale for the use of the thiazolidinediones is unclear

8651244 currently food heated in a microwave loses heat to the cold dish because the dishes are transparent to microwaves
8651245 the plates are still cool when the cooking is completed

8651247 we used cooking oil because it is an innocuous substance
8651248 we could perhaps use this material in a closed system to decompose organic contaminants in soil or dirt
8651249 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8651250 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8651251 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8651252 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8651253 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes

8651255 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases furthermore because it will have so few side effects it has the potential to become the beta blocker of choice for all heart patients
8651256 we know that beta blockers save lives in patients with heart disease so making them safe for those unlucky enough to have a respiratory disorder as well is a clinical imperative i applaud jill baker for questioning why beta blockers should remain contraindicated for so many of her patients and being stirred to correct this with an incisive programme of work in the best traditions of medical research this endeavour was born out of a problem encountered at the sharp end of clinical practice

8651271 i think ive grown a lot since the last incident
8651272 ive been trying to keep my mind straight on what i have to do on the field and off the field just trying to keep a straight head i had to change who i hang around with in order to do the right things i think i wasnt hanging around the right people who werent on the same page i was i learned from that i had to make a change and i think it was for the good
8651273 most of my friends that i hang around with i grew up with since i was 10 or 11 years old its real hard to tell a friend that i have to go do this or i cant hang out with you or why are you doing that that comes with maturity saying no to somebody you care about a lot im on the right path doing what i have to do this year to succeed and help this team win a big east championship
8651274 he has been he has done all the things weve asked him to do since he made that poor decision were hoping he continues to do the right things he has no room for error a lot of that is simply being able to say no
8651275 kids make mistakes and hes made his share of them but hes never turned and run from any of them he takes his punishment without blame were really glad to see going into his senior season that hes matured into a person we could be proud of
8651276 we shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time

8651278 it is recommended you dont say that part out loud
8651279 i looked through all of the revenues and couldnt see a place where we were taking in a lot more than we are not accounting for
8651280 giving them their full property tax levy generates a 90 000 surplus
8651281 i believe that under the current situation we need to lower that by 90 000 to put it back in the general fund
8651282 i know thats not what aukamp wants and not what we need but it may be all we can do
8651283 we need to keep those funds safe and i think we can do some other things
8651284 we have 10 acres out there and i have a person whos interested
8651285 how many times do 20 people try to call at one time
8651286 i do want to point out that we put in 112 000 in 2006 07 to break even the budget
8651287 if were paying for some and not for others were discriminating
8651288 thats why i fought to have the finance meetings during the day
8651289 i can go around the corner to the treasurers office and get the answer
8651290 you could have asked them this morning to have them ready for tonight
8651291 i could have but i didnt have this question until 5 tonight
8651292 i hadnt even thought about where it was being paid from until we started talking about it just now
8651293 this day is the gateway to your lifelong happiness the fairy tale that you grew up believing in finally come true it has to be perfect no matter what
8651294 for the sixteen months of her engagement it is the brides privilege her right indeed her obligation to become preoccupied with herself her appearance her tastes and her ability to showcase them to their best advantage being a bride according to the bridal medias prescription amounts to a quest for self perfection or perfection of the outward self at least
8651295 just when the bride thinks shell have to spend no more its your job to remind her that her bridal image looks incomplete
8651296 t he bride who has been convinced in some barely articulated but nonetheless pervasive sense that coordinating her ribbons and her envelopes will contribute to the future harmony of her marriage has been sold not just an expensive complement of stationery but a dangerous bill of goods
8651297 will you have a wedding with me and then well figure out the rest of it later
8651298 ever wonder why marriage is such a complicated business why people on the inside complain about it people on the outside want in and those who have tried and failed are willing to do it again and again
8651299 its impossible to distinguish between what can be fixed and what can only be accepted as par for the marital course without some awareness of what that course has been
8651300 it is in many ways harder to invent yourself than to have your course mapped out for you
8651301 scholarly publishing and the issues of cultural heritage fair use reproduction fees and copyrights

8651303 i know of which i speak having provided franchise legal counsel to an individual who considered purchasing a silver mine
8651304 closed a corporate store in boulder co and a corporate store in champain sic il
8651305 to close a store directly across the street from a large undergraduate university for lack of business seems counterintuitive and it certainly seems hypocritical given that they see no problem with placing franchise stores close to one another in the city of denver
8651306 they have no key differentiators that cant be replicated easily by the competition anyone considering a silver mine subs is better off working in one of their stores for three months and then opening their own sub shop rather than going the franchising route
8651307 every business makes mistake sic in the beginning and who pays for those mistake sic not the franchisor
8651308 good luck with your store and i hope it works out for you id suggest you think twice before promoting your franchise lest you find yourself not being able to sleep at night as for the non compete good luck enforcing that in a court of law

8651326 the most direct cause is the divorce industry a government run system that tears apart families separates children from fit and loving parents confiscates the wealth of families and turns law abiding citizens into criminals in ways they are powerless to avoid

8651424 it is a shame that we have lost damien duff for the two opening qualifiers he started very well and he is a very important player in the irish squad
8651425 i am happy that fifa and the georgian football federation have made a decision to play the game against georgia in a neutral venue we understand that it was a difficult decision to make but feel it was the correct one given the need to prioritise the safety of players and fans
8651426 there were a lot of positives to take from the austria game they are a good side and were one of the first teams to qualify for the under 21 european championships so i was pleased with our performance and with the result this is a new team we are putting together and these upcoming games will provide good opportunities to have a look at the players
8651427 wenn du nicht schnell genug bist dann kannst du keine punkte holen da hilft dir auch das zuverl ssigste auto nichts bis auf die letzten zwei drei rennen in denen wir nicht schnell genug waren hatten wir die pace aber
8651428 die letzten zwei drei rennen sind eine kleine sorge bis dahin haben wir aber gut gepunktet ganz anders als im vorjahr
8651429 die zuverl ssigkeit ist einer der bereiche in denen wir uns am meisten gesteigert haben dadurch haben wir im vorjahr viele punkte verloren was f r alle sehr schmerzhaft war
8651430 du strengst dich bei einem grand prix an bist am freitag und samstag in einer guten position aber dann l sst dich das auto im rennen im stich das war von der motivation her f r das team und f r mich sehr schwierig im vorjahr
8651431 insofern haben wir uns sehr darum bem ht die zuverl ssigkeit in ordnung zu bekommen das ist heutzutage auch grundvoraussetzung weil alle teams sehr zuverl ssig sind
8651432 j rg es gab in den bisherigen 14 rennen elf verschiedene rennsieger dein kommentar dazu
8651433 bei uns ist die leistungsdichte einfach enorm und auch die qualit t der fahrer ist richtig gut wir haben 15 leute die potentiell rennen gewinnen k nnen meiner meinung nach sind wir mit diesen elf rennsiegern noch nicht da angekommen wo wir am ende der saison stehen werden da kommen mit sicherheit noch einige dazu und das zeigt doch die qualit t der meisterschaft
8651434 momentan gibt es mit bmw chevrolet und seat drei gro e hersteller in der wtcc volvo hat in brands hatch einmal hereingeschnuppert und erw gt einen einstieg w rdest du das begr en
8651435 auf jeden fall die basis dieser meisterschaft ist ja die beste die man sich vorstellen kann jeder hersteller hat doch eigentlich ein zweiliter auto im programm und sch n w re wenn wir sechs oder sieben hersteller h tten volvo f hrt ja in schweden regelm ig mit und dort war auch schon ein mercedes unterwegs es gibt also durchaus viele hersteller die ein passendes auto daf r haben und ich w re froh wenn noch mehr hersteller an bord kommen w rden
8651436 es gibt verschiedene motorenkonzepte in der wtcc was ist denn deine meinung zum thema diesel oder nicht diesel
8651437 das ist schwer zu sagen schwierig ist nun mal die einstufung und da ist die fia gefragt die einstufung vern nftig vorzunehmen wenn man in die vergangenheit blickt oder sich alte formel 1 rennen oder turbo rennwagen ansieht dann merkt man deutlich dass es sehr schwierig ist einen turbomotor mit einem normalen saugmotor zu vergleichen
8651438 von daher ist das im augenblick recht knifflig f r mich ist das halt kein richtiges rennauto wenn da einer an dir vorbeizieht dann pfeift es nur und es h rt sich einfach nicht so an wie sich ein rennwagen anh ren sollte
8651439 dein markenkollege andy priaulx hat in brands hatch formel 1 demorunden gedreht kann man daraus schlie en dass du bei deinem heimrennen eine hnliche show bieten wirst
8651440 das kann ich mir nicht vorstellen sollte so etwas geplant sein dann w sste ich sicherlich schon davon ich denke das ist nicht vorgesehen
8651441 ich bin ja fters beim pitlane park aktiv das war ja das auto das f r gew hnlich im pitlane park unterwegs ist was die marketingabteilung allerdings f r oschersleben geplant hat wei ich nicht ich w rde das schon gerne machen
8651442 w rdest du gerne mal wieder eine formel 1 ausfahrt machen oder sogar einen test bestreiten
8651443 ja klar berhaupt gar keine frage wer tr umt nicht davon ich hatte das gl ck vier jahre lang in der formel 1 als testfahrer zu arbeiten das ist einfach der traum eines jeden rennfahrers das sind nun einmal die schnellsten und geilsten autos die es im motorsport gibt und mit so einem ding zu fahren ist jedes mal eine ehre und ein gro er spa
8651444 da gibt es nichts was ich noch ausprobieren m chte
8651445 du hast in deiner karriere schon viel gemacht bist formel 1 gefahren le mans tourenwagen gibt es noch etwas was du in deinem rennfahrerleben unbedingt ausprobieren willst
8651446 nein ich hab wirklich alles gefahren lacht da gibt es nichts was ich noch ausprobieren m chte es gibt da in dem sinn keine kategorie aber was ich gerne noch einmal machen w rde w re mit einem tollen prototypen nach le mans zu gehen
8651447 das ist so ein traum von mir ich bin einmal zweiter geworden in le mans und einmal in f hrung liegend ausgefallen da habe ich eigentlich noch eine rechnung offen ich w rde das rennen gerne einmal gewinnen
8651448 was erwarte ich mir von oschersleben die erwartungen sind wahrscheinlich bei jedem fahrer gleich ich m chte viele punkte machen bin aber in oschersleben der schwerste bmw daher wird es f r mich wohl recht schwierig werden aber ich war auch schon im vergangenen jahr mit reichlich ballast unterwegs
8651449 damals hat bmw die schnellste runde im qualifying gedreht ich fahre auf dieser strecke sehr gerne und vor dem heimpublikum bin ich nat rlich extrem motiviert ich hoffe einfach dass ich vern nftig punkten und in der meisterschaft weiter nach vorne kommen kann
8651450 auf was muss man in oschersleben besonders achten gibt es besonders knifflige passagen
8651451 grunds tzlich sind auf jeder rennstrecke die letzten beiden kurven vor einer geraden sehr wichtig und das w re in diesem fall die letzte kurve vor start und ziel die sieht einfach aus ist aber wirklich verdammt schwierig man muss da extrem fr h am gas sein und auf diese ecke musst du dich echt konzentrieren die schikane zur gegengeraden und die letzte kurve das w ren solche punkte

8651454 in some cases operators are charging you for a call of one minute and two seconds what they can charge you for two minutes
8651455 this cavalier approach to safety must come to an end
8651456 we no longer air to air refuel to eliminate that risk in the same way that we took out the serious design flaw
8651457 these are our people who fly this aircraft and there is no way we would risk their lives
8651458 the big indicator is are the crews happy to fly on it or not and they are
8651459 the whole foundation of what we do in the raf is relying on the aircrews sense that they want to come back alive the way aircrew work relies on their sense of self preservation if they dont think the aircraft is safe they dont fly on it
8651460 i do get the occasional question from my mum and i try to explain things to her but my parents know its the business ive joined and they know id sense it if something were being covered up
8651461 it is an enormously capable aeroplane and with what we deliver to the troops on the ground its unique all my guys work every hour of the day and are very proud of what nimrod brings to the troops in afghanistan
8651462 the amount of extra checks we do these days is huge sometimes it governs your whole day and if i didnt think it was safe i wouldnt fly on it
8651463 the period after the accident was a difficult time for everyone because we at raf kinloss had lost friends and colleagues everyone had lost someone they knew and the families of those who were lost will always be in our hearts and minds
8651464 but i wasnt worried about returning to work on the nimrod after the accident the aircraft by then had undergone dramatic transformation with the safety measures and the mod board of inquiry gave the potential causes of the accident so we could take action
8651465 it is a great aircraft its great at what it does and the crew are dedicated and focused following loss of xv230 its been very hard for our families as well
8651466 theres been so much negative reporting on nimrod but we fly the plane and we know its safe to fly our families and our friends keep seeing the negative stories so i really want to stress that if nimrod werent safe to fly we wouldnt be on board
8651467 were surprised by how many people opted to get full albums
8651468 but its a good value proposition talk about something thats been lost and forgotten

8651475 to finish my senior year of football knowing it was all worth it
8651476 last season going 0 9 and people just giving up im haunted by that season
8651477 theyre hungry to get the season going and are ready to get back to that point and have an opportunity to complete the mission were going to take one game at a time and play hard
8651478 the kids are focused on it right now this is an experienced group who is working hard having that bad taste in their mouth makes them work even harder
8651479 the returning starters are leading by example and leading verbally
8651480 it will be a lot for a defense to prepare for
8651481 one thing weve developed in the offseason is the sharing of the ball in the passing game
8651482 we dont want to be one dimensional we want to line up three or four wide and have several reads for rob to go through
8651483 we wanted to get both of them more involved in the action
8651484 theyre great cover guys and are tough and physical in run support
8651485 hes accurate with a strong leg he worked hard over the summer and is ready to take over the punting duties as well were looking for a big year from him
8651486 we have big openings to fill we have some kids who are working hard our strength right now is maybe our attitude weve got to become more mature and gain experience were a young football team
8651487 last year i couldnt get comfortable at one position on each side of the ball
8651488 he didnt miss one workout he has a positive attitude
8651489 at the speed camp we also worked on agility and footwork
8651490 each player adjusted in his own way were looking past all that went on over the winter
8651491 were just staying focused on what we have to do to get ready for the season were not worrying about the hype the talk doesnt mean anything unless we go out and take care of business
8651492 we have a lot of senior and veteran leadership on this team
8651493 were looking for a productive year the kids are working hard in practice they know there are a lot of expectations with all the guys coming back
8651494 we want to get you on the field because youre a hell of a tackler
8651495 it gives you a purpose it keeps your life in check
8651496 nothing better than running down the field full speed and crackin someone
8651497 every time i get a chance im hitting someone any chance to make some noise with the pads
8651498 if you mess up its against the best guys on the team
8651499 if someone lines a guy up on the starting offense its like hes a player and hell get a shot at special teams
8651500 if you go down the field and blast the kick returner or break the wedge the coaches will notice that
8651501 hes taken some big hits on scout team and hes delivered some
8651502 that kid puts his nose down and just runs through walls
8651503 we are a veteran team this year we have kids who are talented and bigger than maybe they were last year we have that to work with
8651504 we dont have great speed and this is something we have to work on execution is the big thing for this years team we have to work on our quickness
8651505 this year we will have more potential because we have more talent and more experience with the guys we have coming back
8651506 i think we have a lot of potential just because of the added experience that we do have
8651507 you dont want to be the senior class to break tradition
8651508 he needs to work on his decision making but in terms of playmaking weve never had a guy like him
8651509 the trip to texas is a great bonding experience for the guys
8651510 it should be a pretty competitive game were looking forward to it
8651511 last year we were young to start and then injuries took their toll
8651512 we have 11 starters back and several others who contributed but we need to stay injury free to have success
8651513 he kind of plays by the seat of his pants
8651514 just because you think its sweet and youre hard nosed you still kind of have to pull the reins back on yourself
8651515 i probably wont throw myself around as much this season
8651516 i do have real big shoes to fill but im not paranoid about breaking his records
8651517 we have to put forth a championship effort to meet the championship expectations
8651518 last year they took their lumps but they played nine or 10 games
8651519 but we dont think that at all like coach said its going to be a dogfight
8651520 i think we should be able to do whatever we want on offense
8651521 pizza shops the mall these kids see each other everywhere
8651522 as a coach you hope it doesnt spill over in the streets
8651523 if you win you can taunt them in basketball just like if you win in basketball you can taunt them in baseball
8651524 its going to be different not being the home team different locker room different side for the fans
8651525 itll be different having most of the fans cheer against you
8651526 i think theyre pumped up because theyre moving up and its going to be a challenge
8651527 id be worried if we had no game experience but we have kids who played last year
8651528 he was dancing a little in the backfield last year but we worked with him over the summer to lower that shoulder and get some yards
8651529 we feel he can match up on anyone receiver wise
8651530 we feel comfortable with the secondary which allows us to do some things up front

8651568 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
8651569 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
8651570 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8651571 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
8651572 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
8651573 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
8651574 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
8651575 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty

8651581 we have observed previously that the idea of smoking a cigarette becomes increasingly attractive to smokers while they are craving
8651582 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret
8651583 these findings suggest that smokers are likely to underpredict their own future desire to smoke when theyre not craving a cigarette
8651584 the research not only has implications for helping smokers quit but it also enlightens us on how nonsmokers may pick up the habit if smokers cant appreciate the intensity of their need to smoke when they arent currently craving whats the likelihood that people who have never smoked can do so
8651585 species invasions and extinction the future of native biodiversity on islands
8651586 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
8651587 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8651588 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
8651589 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8651590 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
8651591 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8651592 that by going in and mucking up the system we may have already created the setting where too many species have been packed in and we just havent waited long enough to see these extinctions start to happen
8651593 the whole point of this study was to start looking down the path to see which of these wildly different scenarios might be right
8651594 we havent nailed the answer yet but weve set the stage for answering whether islands are now saturated or not
8651595 it was very surprising to find such a strong correlation between the number of native and exotic plant species on islands around the world
8651596 in ecological research a strong correlation often explains 50 percent of the variation here the correlation between native and exotics explains almost 100 percent of the variation in other words if you know how many native plants are on an oceanic island then you can predict almost perfectly how many exotic plants are there
8651597 which means islands that are far enough away from a continent that theyre not getting regular exchanges with the mainland

8651663 de alguna manera los datos pueden ser mirados desde diferentes pticas esta encuesta es un sondeo de imagen presidencial que hacemos todos los meses en todo el pa s
8651664 venimos viendo c mo ha ido evolucionando junto con los conflictos la imagen de cristina kirchner la imagen est estabilizada no ha crecido todav a a los valores que ten a cuando comenz la gesti n pero tampoco continu cayendo como ven a sucediendo durante el conflicto con el campo

8651666 qu hay que decir pues de la eternidad diremos que es la sustancia misma inteligible an logamente a como si alguien dijera que el tiempo es el cielo universo y el cosmos esta es en efecto la opini n que dicen que a su vez sostuvieron algunos acerca del tiempo porque como nos imaginamos y concebimos que la eternidad es algo sumamente augusto y que la naturaleza inteligible es sumamente augusta y como no es posible decir que una cualquiera de las dos sea m s augusta que la otra mientras que de lo que est m s all no hay que predicar ni siquiera este atributo seg n eso bien pudiera uno identificar ambas cosas porque adem s tanto el cosmos inteligible como la eternidad son ambos inclusivos e inclusivos de las mismas cosas
8651667 yo creo efectivamente en una evoluci n continua del universo y creo que todas las teor as que pretenden describir cu l va a se el estado del universo dentro de algunos miles de a os de millones de a os son prematuras y simplistas con la aparici n de la vida nace un tiempo interno que prosigue durante los miles de millones de a os de la vida y se transmite de una generaci n a otra de una especia a otra especie y no s lo se transmite sino que se hace cada vez m s complejo
8651668 el examen del concepto de tiempo en la edad antigua debe pues llevarse a cabo teniendo presente la noci n de eternidad los hebreos conocieron el tiempo y determinaron o midieron las grandes unidades del tiempo las pocas del a o mediante la posici n del sol en el espacio y las peque as unidades del tiempo el d a y la noche las diversas horas del d a y de la noche por la cantidad de luz u oscuridad pero junto a ello concibieron el tiempo como una serie de percepciones temporales en forma de latidos interiorizando de este modo el tiempo y convirti ndolo en lo que se llama duraci n y temporalidad los griegos conocieron el tiempo a base de los movimientos de los cuerpos celestes y tendieron a considerar el car cter c clico y por tanto repetible de tales movimientos

8651690 our financial results in recent years have mirrored the consistent improvement we have achieved in our business and we finish the year with a stronger business chief executive paul walsh said in the statement
8651691 we enter the new financial year facing slowing global growth and more challenging global economic trends
8651692 but given the strength and diversity of diageos business we believe we can deliver organic operating profit growth for the coming year within our range of 7 0 9 0 per cent mr walsh said
8651693 the main drivers of growth were international where scotch in latin america and beer in africa drove net sales growth of 16 per cent and north america where growth in the priority brands drove a 5 0 per cent increase in net sales mr walsh said

8651713 the biggest advantage to dfd rendering lies in the fact that observers do not have to wear encumbering glasses to view the 3d scene
8651714 although traditional auto stereo displays and volumetric displays also exhibit this quality their inherent technology limits their usability autostereo displays allow for a limited number of views and volumetric displays are usually enclosed within some space which users cannot or should not interact with dfd displays allow for many views and interaction as long as a user is reliably tracked
8651715 for true realism a 3d object should appear exactly where it is expected regardless of what the user is actually doing
8651716 factors like occlusion projection bleed through projector camera calibration errors and dynamic scenes make this an extremely challenging issue coupling this with errors introduced by even the best tracking solutions on the market and an expert user will begin to notice the slight errors in imagery and user to scene registration for our research we used the best available immaterial display the fogscreen but display improvements would definitely improve the fidelity of images and interaction
8651717 a room sized 3d immaterial display would be in many ways the ideal display
8651718 a virtual tour of a museum an all in one entertainment display and a virtual office or living room are all possible applications a future application could be something like virtual surgery e g on a large 3d heart or a telepresence type of application in live environments e g 3d surveillance

8651731 it was a pleasure to be back in durant and visit southeastern oklahoma state university
8651732 this is a big year for southeastern as they celebrate 100 years of providing quality education to students from oklahoma and surrounding states
8651733 i enjoyed meeting with dr turner and discussing several issues important to the university and to higher education as is the case throughout oklahoma and the nation dr turner stressed the tremendous impact of higher energy prices on the school and student budgets i assured dr turner that working to bring down energy prices was my number one priority and that it will remain my focus when congress gets back to work in september
8651734 a secure energy supply must be grounded in three key principles stable diverse and affordable
8651735 we will get this done because of the support of the public
8651736 as americans continue to suffer from high energy prices we need to take advantage of domestic resources of oil and natural gas
8651737 if we had all the fuel in the world it wouldnt do us any good if we cant refine it
8651738 if you remember i was saying that he couldnt win a primary thats how smart i was

8651740 john am i going have to go through my junior senator to see you in the white house and everyone laughed and thought it was pretty funny
8651741 and later on i ran into john in the cloak room and he said look jimmy weve had our differences of opinion but im going to be president and youre going to be chairman of the senate armed services committee and were going to need each other
8651742 was more of a political decision i think john knows it is an extremely powerful force the far left environmentalists
8651743 the happy ending took place when we had that conference in the cloak room
8651744 clearly the most arrogant of the u s senators and theres a lot of competition
8651745 we could be in a better position in the future and find ourselves in a place where we can have far greater environmental protection more reliable and diverse energy sources and a strong economy
8651746 in my career i have championed policies that encourage the u s to meet its energy needs domestically
8651747 developing energy at home translates to energy security to ensure stable sources of supply today more than ever before our energy policy is a matter of national security this means we must work to increase domestic energy productions by expanding development and the refining of oil increasing exploration and production of natural gas continuing development for uses of coal and clean coal technologies developing renewable sources of energy such as wind and further developing nuclear energy right now we have 32 applications in place for nuclear power plants throughout the country
8651748 the price of gas is the biggest issue facing americans today
8651749 i believe that we should not buy gas from other places when we have plenty of resources here

8651755 what happened in permatang pauh was not something so big as to change the situation that exists after the last general election
8651756 the permatang pauh by election is one by election that cannot be interpreted as something that can happen in other constituencies i believe we can still continue the government
8651757 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8651758 police will use a softened stance to deal with the protesters
8651759 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out

8651776 we have so many weapons were going to be stacked i dont think its going to be a starter or a non starter i think its going to be more like what new york had last year when anybody could come in and make the defense work
8651777 they always say the first year is the learning year and the next year is the polishing year
8651778 and i think thats definitely the case anytime you get new players and new schemes you just have to learn how to get better as a team and grow as a team
8651779 contrary to everything ive heard we have not made a decision we have not named kurt the starting quarterback so that was inaccurate and it was unfortunate it was out there
8651780 oh man i didnt even know how many weapons we have we have so many weapons were going to be stacked i dont think its going to be a starter or a non starter i think its going to be more like what new york had last year when anybody could come in and make the defense work

8651887 much of the illegal logging that is causing severe environmental and human destruction and suffering is taking place in the jungle and highland forest areas where the hmong people live especially in khammoune province luang prabang vientiane province xieng khouang province and saysamboune xaisamboune closed military zone systemic corruption within the lao people democratic republic lpdr military and communist party leadership also appears to have facilitated the exploitation
8651888 hmong women and children are dying and being killed so that wooden furniture can be made from the timber cut illegally by lao and vietnamese military owned companies and corrupt officials according to recent and continued reports illegal logging by vietnamese military owned companies of the peoples army of vietnam pavn is taking place at the same time significant numbers of pavn troops have been mobilized in laos in cooperation with the lao peoples army lpa troops in xieng khouang province saysamboune closed military zone vang veng vientiane province in other key areas for the purpose of killing or capturing some 15 000 hmong unarmed civilians in laos
8651889 tragically the issue of systemic corruption within the ranks of the lpdr military and central committee of the lao politbureaus military generals is helping to drive this trade and is costing the lives of thousands of innocent hmong women and children who are being driven off their mountains and homelands by the lao and vietnamese military and vietnamese military owned companies so that the timber and logs from the ancient rain forests and jungles can be transported to vietnam and made into furniture or exported out of the vietnamese port city of vinh to foreign markets
8651890 vietnam including pavn military owned logging companies are currently engaged in large scale illicit logging in laos much of the logging is taking place in xieng khouang province and other areas where some 15 000 hmong civilians are under brutal attack by the lao and vietnamese military the logs and timber from ancient forests in the highlands of laos are being largely shipped for export from the vietnamese seaport of vinh in vietnam which is connected to laos and the traditional hmong homelands where thousands of hmong people are now being hunted killed and starved to death
8651891 hundreds of troops of vietnams pavn and the lao peoples army have mobilized in the last 72 hours and are in the process of hunting and killing innocent unarmed hmong civilians including many women and children in phou da phao mountain area and in xieng khouang province where much of the illegal logging is also taking place by vietnamese military owned companies
8651892 helicopter gunships are circling and attacking the laotian and hmong people hiding in the jungle and mountains the vietnamese troops are working to assist the brutal lao military forces engaged in these war crimes and crimes against humanity which includes surrounding and seeking to starve these people to death
8651893 currently some 15 000 hmong and laotians are trapped in key areas of laos where this illegal logging has taken place and we are very concerned that many thousands of civilians will be killed in the coming days and weeks
8651894 vietnam is now exploiting the forests of neighboring laos to obtain valuable hardwoods for its outdoor furniture industry
8651895 they gain virtually nothing from this trade instead the money goes to corrupt officials in laos and businesses in vietnam and thailand

8651914 that probably distills down to about 40 000 a month and thats a hell of a lot of aircraft flying circles around this community
8651915 ive been told about 70 per cent of movements at the airport involve international trainees theyre practising their skills over a heavily populated area and you might say a percentage of them are unskilled its a great concern
8651916 when youre talking about humans and mechanical contraptions theres got to be that potential for something to go wrong
8651917 moorabbin airport is the busiest airport in australia for aircraft movements
8651918 it deals mainly with old noisy light aircraft majority over 30 years old as opposed to general aviation traffic elsewhere
8651919 the majority of activity is light aircraft used by flying schools for daily repetitive circuit training

8651933 indian team was worried when jayawrdene and thushara were scoring runs
8651934 having a fifth bowler is a luxury we have to make do with four bowlers but we have bowlers like yuvraj raina and virat who can bowl we needed one extra batsman
8651935 earlier india had batsmen who could play till the end and i could go for big shots early i am however happy that i still have strike rate of 90 thougu i would have been happier to have a strike rate of over hundred
8651936 when you are scoring centuries you dont ask these questions every batsman has highs and lows the idea of playing sangakkara as opener is to have some senior batsman to get more balls to play
8651937 tough position to be in it is a challenging situation playing at home do not want to lose series we know where we are going wrong
8651938 we will lose badly the youngsters will be mentally scarred traumatized for life they need to be shepherded

8651961 de gebruikersaantallen zijn inderdaad minder dan verwacht toch heeft de proef zeker wat opgeleverd in zijn soort was de pilot vorig jaar uniek internationaal onontgonnen terrein inmiddels heeft hij navolging gekregen in denemarken en lopen er gesprekken in die richting in australi

8651973 due to the smaller processor footprint the 45nm technologies are also the ideal basis for developing a new range of cost effective and energy saving embedded computer applications computer on modules are a perfect fit for such applications since the location of the external interface connectors is flexibly determined by the application specific carrier board
8651974 the enhanced performance per watt from the 45nm intel core 2 processor sp9300 enables system designers to improve system efficiency including ddr3 memory support fanless designs improved emc and mtbf and longer battery life
8651975 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8651976 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8651977 its because of the respect we have for them and the enormity of the challenge we have in front of us trying to win back to back south african test matches and in johannesburg for the first time in so long that we feel we need to bring in some fresh legs
8651978 last weekend took a lot out of our guys as it did some of theirs we will need the impetus that the fresh legs weve included today will bring
8651979 saturday still has huge significance in terms of momentum in the tri nations but also as far as the development of our group as a whole is concerned
8651980 by winning in durban last weekend we have presented ourselves with an opportunity to win back to back test matches in south africa which is not only rare in an australian context but also historically significant across the game in general
8651981 and while the place was packed there was still room to move as the absinthe flowed personally i love the idea of the specialized bar without the frills and
8651982 it was pretty uncrowded with an easy door they literally only serve absinthe and beer and there are no cocktails as i was sharply informed by the bartender they also do the absinthe service with the sugar and water like at hotel delmano the crowd was banker and trendy les siders less hipster oh and the guy at the door was hilarious with bright suspenders he looks like something out of the monopoly era they are really going all out with this whole 1920s thing
8651983 im giving this four stars instead of five because it just isnt my kind of bar im a fan of the secret bar phenomenon because you can actually hear yourself think
8651984 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8651985 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8651986 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8651987 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8651988 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8651989 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8651991 we have not blocked other applications from our version of the xv6800 it is standard for third parties to have to make changes to their applications to be compatible with verizon wireless devices every carrier is different so what one does doesnt necessarily mean every one else can or will accept the same product we have a development program in place to assist third parties in making other gps applications compatible with verizon wireless devices additional third party applications will be available in the future we chose to introduce the device with what was available rather than wait until additional applications became available
8651992 verizon claims xv6800 update doesnt block gps just makes everyone work with verizon

8652037 id actually make the point that for us second hand sales is a very critical situation because people are selling multiple times intellectual property
8652038 what were trying to do is build business models that are more and more online supported with additional services and additional content that you get online so people will see the value in not just getting that physical disc to play at home alone but actually playing those games online and paying for them
8652039 in our understanding of the business model we are actually giving away the rights to play and if you just pass it on pass it on pass it on that is not comparable to second hand sales in the normal physical goods area where you have physical wear out second hand cars second hand clothes second hand books theyre all physically wearing out so you have an inferior quality product
8652040 but digital goods is not actually becoming inferior in quality so people passing that on is actually very challenging for us
8652041 its actually also a very interesting discussion to ask how much cannibalisation do you really have on second hand sales
8652042 thats such a complex subject were not going to be overly confrontational were going to solve it with better more interesting and online offering going forward and that should actually solve the whole current dilemma

8652076 i believe it is important that charities are free to focus as much time as possible on their core purpose which is why i am delighted that these changes will see the administrative burdens of thousands of charities reduced
8652077 however i also recognise that proper accounting standards are important because people who donate money want to know it is being used properly but there is a balance to be struck and i am confident that these changes get that balance right
8652078 achieving proportionate regulation is about finding the right balance focussing on areas of greatest risk and ensuring that public accountability is greatest where the bulk of charitable resource lies these changes represent another crucial step towards lightening the load for smaller charities whilst targeting the regulatory and accountability focus on larger charitable incomes those organisations which enjoy most of the publics donations and most of the exchequers taxation relief

8652104 one of them zoomed in on what appeared to be a body
8652105 when the wind blew you could see it appeared to be hanging by a cable
8652106 it appears to be sitting in an aluminium harness and hanging from a cable so that leads us to believe its an airman
8652107 the location of the find is near a flight path commonly used by allied aircraft during world war ii sorties
8652108 a number of allied aircraft have been reported as missing in this area
8652109 these include a b 25 mitchell and a number of kittyhawks
8652110 if it is a body it is a significant find
8652111 unfortunately there are many in that part of the world that have never been found
8652112 every step would be taken to identify the body and accord it a proper burial
8652113 part of it maybe is trying to avoid the peaks with commuters knowing they can be congested and we want to see major investment to alleviate that

8652122 i see more money coming into system and i see it coming in a more obvious and direct manner
8652123 we hope go back to a system where people will send money directly to candidates
8652124 youll be able to track that and if contributions are not going directly to candidates youll have to question the motives
8652125 it just doesnt make sense that you can give more money to a state representative than you can to a candidate for president

8652143 la cl usula era de 150 millones de euros y nunca iba a mover un dedo para salir del valencia
8652144 si me quieren fichar deben negociar con el valencia porque yo estoy a gusto aqu mi actual club no ha aceptado una oferta de mucho dinero y eso para mi es un orgullo en definitiva no he visto posibilidad alguna de salir de mestalla

8652151 a la afici n hemos de decirle que tenga tranquilidad y fe que no nos den las gracias porque hacer grande al equipo es una exigencia que parte de nosotros mismos

8652155 i am proud and honoured to be in a position to be able to offer my advice to those candidates as they start the task of transforming this city for the benefit of all its people
8652156 boris johnson made it clear during his election campaign that he did not want to be on the payroll of hugo chavez and did not believe a poor south american country should be subsidising one of the wealthiest cities in the world

8652167 so far weve seen a series of unfortunate decisions by the russians that only serve to further isolate them and we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
8652168 i can assure you that these are purely humanitarian aid shipments that are going into georgia and nothing else
8652169 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8652170 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8652171 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8652226 we recognise the need for a practical and an achievable vision of a safe south africa a vision that encapsulates an ideal safe society

8652235 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterising the past decade continues
8652236 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the north pole area right now is covered with very thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8652237 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8652238 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the arctic ocean in summer by 2030 or so

8652288 and a lot of them didnt understand you cant order a vehicle
8652289 you have to take whats on the lots and you have to take delivery by the 16th
8652290 the bigger sales surge is going to be when the retirees get the 2 600
8652291 theyve never gotten that before now we have a lot of people coming in who are already retired looking for new cars and trucks
8652292 a lot of them waited until the last minute because they were waiting for the 2009 f 150
8652293 but now its been pushed back and it wont be available until november
8652294 does it make sense to put the most valuable thing which is the station in the middle of 16 lanes
8652295 highways are not friendly to transit oriented developments no one wants to live by them
8652296 what we would really like is to bury that toll road
8652297 es una posibilidad grande ayer con el gobernador daniel scioli estuvimos trabajando y hacerlo todo junto es una de las grandes posibilidades y ver si podemos a la misma oferta buscarle otras alternativas que mejoren la estructura del salario

8652315 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8652316 le kun et maniche nous ont donn des ailes pour penser que nous pourrions remonter
8652317 tout sest bien termin je me sens comme un de plus
8652318 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8652319 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8652320 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8652321 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8652322 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8652323 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8652324 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8652325 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8652326 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8652327 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8652328 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8652329 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8652330 mauras background in working both inside and outside the library system will help her communicate with a broad public audience the shape of the new public library services in this digital age
8652331 her dynamic style deep seated commitment to open principles and demonstrated success at implementing partnerships and initiatives in the digital space will be a powerful combination in taking the oca to the next level
8652332 we are delighted that maura will take on this leadership role at such an important juncture for the organization the open content alliance represents the largest group of libraries universities and cultural heritage institutions in the world supporting a universal digital library that is truly open non profit and non exclusive
8652333 maura will help to turn the oca into a stand alone membership organization that will play a leadership role on the national and global stage
8652334 over the past three years members of the oca have made incredibly important strides toward building a truly open digital information commons and i am thrilled to have the opportunity to lead the organization to new levels of growth and collaboration
8652335 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8652336 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8652337 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8652338 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8652339 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8652340 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8652341 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8652342 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8652343 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products
8652344 sfca maintains that it is not responsible for products previously manufactured by simplicity inc
8652345 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8652346 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8652347 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8652348 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8652349 hey dave whats up pause oh crap i will be there in 5 minutes

8652377 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market
8652378 at this time justification for use of thiazolidinediones is very weak to non existent
8652379 further compound their already increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease
8652380 represent conditions that are major precursors of congestive heart failure
8652381 we reported in the journal diabetes care in june 2007 that thiazolidinediones doubled the risk of congestive heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes
8652382 the increased heart failure appears to be a class effect
8652383 the unfavorable findings from the three trials have not been fully realized by the medical community
8652384 safer cheaper and more effective treatment alternatives are available that do not carry these negative cardiovascular risks in patients with diabetes the rationale for the use of the thiazolidinediones is unclear
8652385 vaginal birth has evolved markedly in the last 2 decades so that much greater emphasis is now given to the experience of the parents and to early bonding
8652386 to emulate as closely as practicable the woman centered aspects of natural vaginal birth
8652387 and the baby then frequently delivers his her own arms in an expansive gesture
8652388 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8652389 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8652390 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8652391 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8652392 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8652393 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8652394 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8652395 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8652396 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8652397 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8652398 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8652399 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8652400 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8652401 who are open to doing something on the production side
8652402 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8652403 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8652404 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8652405 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8652406 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8652407 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8652408 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8652409 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8652410 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8652411 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8652412 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8652413 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8652414 does your partner get angry so easily that you feel like youre

8652419 a close watch is being kept on the trend of sugar prices and if needed additional quantity would be released to check the prices
8652420 the rice procurement as on august 26 was 269 09 lakh tons against the overall procurement of 251 07 lakh tons in 2006 2007 in august 2008 6 06 lakh tons of rice has been procured compared with 1 09 lakh tons procured in august 2007
8652421 it is estimated that the stock of wheat as on 1 4 2009 will be higher at 78 60 lakh tons compared to the buffer norms of 40 lakh tons similarly rice stock will be 62 43 lakh tons as on 1 10 2008 against the buffer norm of 52 lakh tons

8652452 al parecer ha habido un error de interpretaci n por parte del gremio la resoluci n ministerial 578 2008 minsa de ninguna manera pretende que un m dico trabaje m s de cuatro horas en consulta externa s se busca que complete su jornada diaria de seis horas ininterrumpidas realizando en las dos horas restantes actividades sanitarias de car cter asistencial en funci n de las necesidades del servicio
8652453 de esa manera ser posible ampliar de cuatro a seis horas la atenci n de pacientes en consultorios externos que es el objetivo de la medida dispuesta por la sede central
8652454 se obtendr an un mill n de horas adicionales de atenci n al p blico en un a o

8652462 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point

8652474 trucking is big business in maryland so it is important to teach cars and trucks how to co exist safely on our highways share the road is a vital part of our efforts to make drivers aware of the blind spots around trucks and help everyone make it home safely
8652475 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

8652598 but if we can do it the way we play it is even better because football is to entertain people and to take pleasure and that is what we are doing at

8652604 it was a big disappointment for the fans to see what happened during the summer
8652605 ade is a big big player and last year he showed he has the quality to be one of the best in europe so we just have to be behind him
8652606 it is difficult of course for the fans but i am sure if he starts scoring goals and in december is on 15 20 goals everything will be fine

8652639 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
8652640 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
8652641 what is needed from the devolved administration at stormont is a set of policies to take account of the different population profiles in the catholic and protestant communities to answer their different needs and stop following the outdated nio mindset of trying to pretend that everything here would be ok if everyone started behaving as if they lived in england
8652642 in january five north belfast protestant clergy wrote to the unionist oriented news letter complaining of the failure of the executive to tackle sectarianism they wrote we have poor inter community relationships effective apartheid in housing across our villages towns and cities community division exemplified in but not confined to the physical structures of peace walls slow pace of reconciliation sectarianism and fractured educational provision our real angst is that a suggested programme for government almost totally fails to acknowledge these profoundly difficult issues exist the response from the dup junior minister in ofmdfm mr donaldson was that power sharing was the shared interpretation which seemed to confuse politics as means with the ends it aimed to realise the draft programme for government had significantly replaced the language of a shared future with a better future inline with its prioritisation of the economy a much more convivial focus for members of the political class than the challenge of tackling the communal divisions in which they were so deeply implicated the revised pfg32 published by messrs paisley and mcguinness introduced the clumsy circumlocution of a shared and better future
8652643 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well
8652644 in every society there is a substantial gap between the life expectancy of the children of the most affluent and privileged and those who are born into deprivation but some countries are better than others at closing the gap
8652645 a boy in the suburb of calton glasgow can expect to live 28 years less than one raised in lenzie a few miles away one born in hampstead london will live around 11 years longer than a boy from st pancras five stops away on the northern line of the underground
8652646 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8652647 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8652648 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8652649 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8652650 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
8652651 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
8652652 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8652653 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8652654 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8652655 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8652656 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8652657 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8652658 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8652659 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8652660 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8652661 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages

8652853 they locked themselves in a room for three days with five bottles of tequila and wrote the most offensive outrageous script ive ever read

8652871 many people thought the sky was falling this spring but the economy actually expanded quite solidly
8652872 a knowledgeable republican source says there the matter was settled at a major meeting of mccains advisers wednesday

8652876 we couldnt be more excited with the creative direction josh schwartz and his team are executing on chuck
8652877 this show has really hit its stride and deserves a full season commitment to carry out the producers vision for this unique series
8652878 quiero invitar al se or presidente a que saquemos esa bandera blanca
8652879 i read your name in the guest book from the funeral and i just thought i dont know what i thought
8652880 el estatuto org nico de bogot eob se qued corto en cuanto a lo que autoriza la constituci n de 1991 en materia de autonom a y descentralizaci n queremos en primer lugar exigir al congreso de la rep blica mayor autonom a para nuestra ciudad que se respete el cap tulo de r gimen especial para el distrito capital
8652881 queremos una ciudad unitaria con autonom a de sus localidades pero desde luego sin llegar a la municipalizaci n
8652882 quiero invitar al se or presidente a que saquemos esa bandera blanca
8652883 theyve expelled from all villages remnants of the georgian population theyve destroyed their houses theyve looted their property theyve burned down their fields forests
8652884 the presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of respect for historic and cultural traditions of every country and efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8652885 we understand the complicated history and reality of the south ossetia and abkhazia issue
8652886 in the meantime in light of our consistent principle and position on issues alike we hope to see relevant parties resolve the issue properly through dialogue and consultation
8652887 the situation in the region should be resolved in dialogue
8652888 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8652889 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8652890 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i cant wait to get started again
8652891 ive always admired him and hes certainly been a target of mine since i came to the football club
8652892 im stunned and surprised its absolutely brilliant news i wasnt really aware i was in the frame and it is a surprise but obviously it is a very nice one
8652893 the chance of linking up with the squad for a game at wembley is certainly something to look forward to
8652894 i have not been involved with any of the england teams before i think i was close to turning out for the under 19s but missed out with injury
8652895 its certainly a good progression for me which is what its all about as a professional its going to be a great experience
8652896 there are some top players in that squad just meeting up and training with them will benefit me its also good that kights kightly is there as well
8652897 im not really thinking too much about whether ill get a chance or not at this stage im still new to the squad and its still sinking in
8652898 i dont think a player should be able to play for two clubs in the same competition in the same season and i think we need to get the uefa strategic committee to look at the whole idea
8652899 i think that it is wrong that a player can play for two clubs in any competition scoring a goal for one team one week and then scoring against them a few weeks later
8652900 i also think we have to look at both the summer and winter transfer windows the season starts in many countries in july or early in august yet the transfer window does not close till the end of august
8652901 then we have another window in the middle of the season i think we need to look at the way the system works
8652902 vimpelcom announced today it has signed an agreement with apple to bring iphone 3g to russia expected later this year
8652903 new york listed vimpelcom part owned by norways telenor asa said it would begin supplying the latest 3g iphone which is suitable for use with third generation mobile networks by the end of 2008
8652904 like rivals oao mobile telesytems and oao megafon vimpelcom is in the process of building a countrywide 3g network capable of providing high speed internet and mobile television
8652905 all three operators will eventually offer the iphone russian media have reported
8652906 theoretically i expect the certification of the drink tax referenda could go all the way to the commonwealth or state supreme court
8652907 the slanderous allegations that are being made by mr ford in an attempt to clear his name i think are unfortunate
8652908 mr ford doesnt want to do anything which would in any way upset or interfere with such investigations as you know the proceedings regarding federal grand juries are secret
8652909 installing a new government could demotivate the security sector reform process if we say well reform and then nothing happens that will be very dangerous
8652910 guinea bissau has more generals than africas most populous nation nigeria
8652911 many members of the military and the police havent been paid in two months
8652912 you dont want military officers having to sell coffee in the streets to survive thats a recipe for disaster
8652913 drug trafficking is a big threat here and it will undermine everything we do to build peace here if it is not tackled
8652914 key people such as the ministers of defence and of justice have not changed and the new government has given assurance that it will not change ongoing plans
8652915 security sector reform alongside good governance and building up the governments administrative capacity is a pre condition for everything the un does here
8652916 estamos ante un problema grave de formaci n por eso tenemos que iniciar acciones desde la educaci n y desde la familia la idea es que los menores de edad cuenten con actividades extraescolares que les permitan utilizar bien su tiempo libre
8652917 los alcaldes locales saben que est n autorizados para tomar estas decisiones
8652918 quiero invitar al se or presidente a que saquemos esa bandera blanca
8652919 incremente la eficiencia de su departamento de soporte t cnico y mesa de ayuda con una herramienta de soporte remoto bajo demanda

8652922 i can officially say that stefano will stay at roma
8652923 the opinion of coach luciano spalletti was decisive and he wanted to keep okaka
8652924 he suggested that was the case before the friendly against monaco but it is only over the last few days that he made his decision
8652925 it could be valuable for okaka to continue at trigoria where he grew up and he is very enthusiastic for the opportunity to play for his place
8652926 hes a top professional who has spent his career in england playing at premier league level
8652927 he believes he is a premier league player i believe that as well so we have got a very good player on our hands
8652928 he will add some extra quality to the squad and is another step towards taking us where we want to be
8652929 hes not just the top manager in europe hes top of the world hes the one everyone looks up to
8652930 you cant work at that level and stay with one club for so long if you do not have exceptional qualities
8652931 i know sir alex but i havent played against him so i am looking forward to the game which i know will be very difficult
8652932 all the team knows is that things of this importance will pass above us and it does not have to affect us i see santi as very relaxed for us he is a very important player and key for the team his sale would have been hard to take
8652933 this situation is natural in the world of football and it should not affect anything i believe these things will motivate more than they affect
8652934 our research shows that when given the option consumers recognize the incredible value proposition that digital copy provides as a simple fast way to move content to a portable device
8652935 digital copy puts the disc at the center of the digital revolution happening in households nationwide and meets the entertainment needs of the entire family from the tv to the computer to an ipod

8652963 i mean souths fans are probably hoping he punches me in the head again
8652964 but to be honest its just not that big of a deal for me now you know
8652965 what happened last year im over it im sure hes over it too he had to sit out the first half of the season so he wouldnt be too happy its finished as far as im concerned
8652966 it amp squo d be hard not to remember wouldn amp squo t it

8652972 hes one player loved by people in queensland nsw and victoria
8652973 hes absolutely phenomenal i cant think of a player who has been in such freakish form for such a long period of time
8652974 brett mullins hit a purple patch midway through 1994 but he didnt do it for more than 12 months like billy has
8652975 hes no longer just a ball runner but a ball player
8652976 statistically he might be better but hes always been one of those players who is jumping out of his skin
8652977 hes a better player now in terms of experience and he probably understands the game better
8652978 if i need to dive and take a ball i know there could be a collision but thats my job for the team and if i dont put my body on the line or i dont take the bombs im not doing my job
8652979 if one or two players dont do their job then generally your team loses
8652980 so this year i made a point of enjoying myself and not worrying about things that are out of my control
8652981 a couple of years ago i worried about rep sides i was injured and had a couple of suspensions but theres no use worrying about those things it also helps having a great side to play with
8652982 if i get less room to move that means steve turner or greg inglis gets extra space to move there are phases

8652987 ya pokoknya dia baik sangat solehah kalo untuk lebih detilnya saya saat ini tak bisa ngasih informasi
8652988 with the recent departure of michael nicklasson were searching for a new bass player
8652989 contrary to popular belief the us doesnt welcome all foreign musicians with open arms
8652990 we regret to say this but the tour is over before it even started thanks to everyone that worked so hard to bring us down there for the shows we had booked well hopefully have better luck next time and be able to play for all you crazy west coast metalheads
8652991 the rotted are pleased to announce their new bassist as none other than the reverend trudgill former frontman of eccentric british metal loons screamin daemon
8652992 when doctors saw the baby had a temperature of 40 degrees centigrade they decided to use a catheter to administer intravenous fluids in order to bring down the high temperature
8652993 he beat me up and told me to go to the place where i got infected he did not believe what i told him
8652994 once they her in laws told me angrily since the child got infected because of negligence by the state medical workers it is the state that must treat him and provide all the necessary things
8652995 but i will never give my son to a nursing home he will live only with me
8652996 we have problems getting timely delivery of the necessary medicines
8652997 i am lost and i do not know what to do i know only one thing i should do everything to make my son feel good
8652998 they come from nookat osh and karasuu districts to see me i do not know how they found me
8652999 because of stigma they are afraid that people will find out that their families have hiv positive members
8653000 all of us talked about the problems that families with hiv positive members have
8653001 i received a lot of information and so much moral support that when i returned home i conducted similar seminars for parents of hiv positive children you cannot imagine how they listened to me how important it is to us
8653002 its a way for visitors to come and see and learn about water good stewardship conservation and also about plants that are around water
8653003 and its also a beautiful way to enjoy brooklyn botanic garden and its a cooling wonderful sensation you can hear water you can see it gurgling you can see it spraying and you can see the calm reflective pools
8653004 how do you expect them to sell at a cheaper price when they bought the maize at a much higher price
8653005 those who need the maize will continue coming to us and we will go by our terms i bought the maize at a high price and cannot accept anything less than the price i want
8653006 it is obvious that smallholder farmers will not grow enough maize because they will not make any profits i believe that farmers who have maize should continue selling to a trader who is offering more money
8653007 a throwback to an era of failed state control over food markets
8653008 an organ of the state and thus politically motivated which adds another level of concern
8653009 modern states typically work to reduce monopoly and monopsony power when a buyer controls a large proportion of the market and drives prices down to level the playing field for farmers consumers and traders this is a move in the opposite direction reconcentrating market power in the hands of one organisation
8653010 would do better to focus on providing the physical and institutional infrastructure necessary for private small traders to blossom grow and compete with one another to offer the best prices quality and service to farmers and consumers alike
8653011 since january we have been buying maize at prices that were not justified at all
8653012 with admarc as the only buying and selling point we are assured of enough maize at an affordable price
8653013 they the traders sold us our own maize at exorbitant prices for no good reasons
8653014 they started the speculation that there is no maize when we were told by government that there is enough to feed us till the next harvest all they wanted was to sell at high prices
8653015 we are in the process of re evaluating our relationship with russia
8653016 we are doing that in concert with our international partners
8653017 i dont think there is anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8653018 as far as support is concerned we are allies and that says it all
8653019 we cannot support the aggression which was unleashed by georgia i think what russia did was correct
8653020 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8653021 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president

8653035 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways

8653044 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january

8653046 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8653047 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8653048 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8653049 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8653050 no one works for someone we all just work together
8653051 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8653052 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8653053 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8653054 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8653055 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8653056 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8653057 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8653058 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8653059 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8653060 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8653061 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8653062 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8653063 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8653064 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8653065 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8653066 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8653072 im only in my second year at souths but it is something that ive certainly noticed
8653073 the two clubs have been great rivals for 100 years
8653074 im the new boy at souths but already i can feel something about playing the sydney roosters were neighbours of each other
8653075 there is such a lot of history to the two clubs and they have had so many battles so many great confrontations
8653076 the roosters would be disappointed that they have lost a couple of games with the finals just around the corner
8653077 they have been up and down over the past few weeks
8653078 im at that point where i dont want to talk about it i just want to play
8653079 with the position were in its time for the talk to end
8653080 i amp squo m only in my second year at souths but it is something that i amp squo ve certainly noticed
8653081 it was a risk because we knew in the backs of our minds how brilliant miagi was
8653082 but he could no longer continue to race on the leg and would have eventually broke down if he didnt have the operation
8653083 after the operation he kept pulling up sore in the hips when we worked him so we had to ease up in training him for four months
8653084 it was always going to be a rush job to get him to the nationals but hes such a champion racer his courage has pulled him through
8653085 it was a freak accident jill was coming out of the surgery and this cattle dog decided to suddenly latch itself on to miagi
8653086 to this day hes frightened of foreign dogs but thankfully it hasnt affected his racetrack confidence

8653095 to come clean and confirm whether this delay is because childrens personal information is at risk
8653096 however we have identified some issues as a result of recent system tests which we are working urgently to address
8653097 more work needed to be done before embarking on the final phases of testing which includes testing with users
8653098 i am sure you will agree that it is both prudent and sensible to take a little more time to ensure the system is right
8653099 we repeatedly warned the government of the problems with contactpoint but they pressed ahead regardless ignoring our calls to allow time to sort them out
8653100 there were clear indications in february of significant security concerns with this database
8653101 only now with just weeks to go until the project is supposed to go live have they finally agreed to pull back to try to iron out some of the problems
8653102 instead of delaying the launch of the database this intrusive project must be scrapped altogether
8653103 a recent independent review has already undermined all of the governments assurances that the database will be secure the discovery of further technical issues does not bode well for the future

8653123 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
8653124 in two or three years were going to be at 200 a barrel could be 300 a barrel for oil
8653125 and consequently our economy is going to struggle and our security is a disaster
8653126 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8653127 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8653128 i look forward to continuing to grow and develop the business as one of the uks leading lifestyle hotel operators
8653129 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8653130 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8653131 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8653132 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8653133 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8653134 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8653135 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8653136 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8653137 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8653138 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8653139 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8653140 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8653141 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8653142 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8653143 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8653144 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8653145 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8653146 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8653147 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8653148 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8653149 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8653150 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8653151 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8653152 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8653153 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8653154 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8653155 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8653156 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8653157 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8653158 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8653159 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8653160 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8653161 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8653162 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8653163 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8653164 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8653165 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8653166 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8653167 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8653168 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8653169 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8653170 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8653171 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8653172 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8653173 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8653174 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8653175 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8653176 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8653177 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8653178 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8653179 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8653180 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8653181 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8653182 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8653183 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8653184 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8653185 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8653186 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8653187 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8653188 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8653189 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8653190 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8653191 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8653192 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8653193 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8653194 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8653195 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8653196 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8653197 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8653198 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8653199 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8653200 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

8653216 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8653217 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8653218 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8653219 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8653220 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8653247 many patients end up taking warfarin for the rest of their lives but there has been a lot of debate about this because although blood thinners reduce the risk of clotting they also increase the risk of major bleeding and we havent known how to balance these risks
8653248 our study is the first to identify a group of patients who are at low risk of recurrent clotting and therefore may be able to safely stop taking warfarin after six months if the results are confirmed in further studies and this rule becomes widely used it could help prevent many cases of major bleeding and death and also reduce the large health care costs associated with chronic warfarin therapy
8653249 the study conducted by dr rodger and his team offers tremendous promise for the thousands of women who have suffered from blood clots and those who are at risk
8653250 the findings also demonstrate the importance of using knowledge gained from health research to create new treatment options that benefit our health and our health care system

8653518 for suspicion of either sneaking drugs in or attempting to seek work illegally despite the fact that the band had valid working papers in their possession
8653519 was detained for more than five hours at the blaine washington border facilities where bored security agents strip searched one of the members and refused to listen to the bandmembers account of why they were there singer greg cavanagh was held for four hours then refused entry to the u s because of suspicion of rampant drug use voluminous encounters with prostitutes and satanism after the border agents reviewed the bands myspace page at one point barthe was held at gunpoint by five officers he was asked to lay down on the ground was handcuffed and returned to canada in a u s border protection vehicle after almost five hours of screaming door slamming and accusations the rest of the band was asked to return to canada
8653520 contrary to popular belief the u s doesnt welcome all foreign musicians with open arms we regret to say this but the tour is over before it even started thanks to everyone that worked so hard to bring us down there for the shows we had booked well hopefully have better luck next time and be able to play for all you crazy west coast metalheads
8653521 we want as many people as possible to show up and to be filmed and be included in the crowd for the video dressed up and hot preferably
8653522 wow what a lame post to try to justify why zynga has a ton more users than sgn does
8653523 was acting under orders of the florida department of law enforcement in an attempt to set up criminal activity and was not in fact seeking money because of child support obligations
8653524 a girl was living with denker gt and his girl friend and this girl was fed drugs until the point where she was burned out
8653525 i believe in a crime of this nature there should be some jail time served
8653526 there was absolutely no proof of those allegations the sentence was made solely on the basis of the crime
8653527 i certainly hope i win my appeal and am absolved of the whole thing
8653528 i am especially happy that the judge firmly went on the record and cleared me of the allegations made in the pre sentence report
8653529 i do not fear prison i do not fear prison at all
8653530 some people on the outside think its the biggest horror show on earth
8653531 as for adjusting to it no problem as long as you act and conduct yourself as a man
8653532 you havent learned how to occupy yourself you feel youre on a treadmill with no end
8653533 i think its a horror show how the government has elevated the stool pigeon and the snitch to an honorable term in society
8653534 youve got somebody charged with a little bit of reefer
8653535 so smuggling drugs is a terrible crime therefore we should throw out the constitution and the constitution should not be applied to smugglers
8653536 our position is that its possible that the property they offer as collateral for the bond gt was purchased with the profits of the drug business
8653537 did you determine where they got the money to buy the property
8653538 just like i dont know where you got the money to buy your suit
8653539 we are still investigating and there is a possibility of more arrests
8653540 it was more than apparent that the bales came from their vessel
8653541 we hope this case will be a deterrent on trafficking
8653542 its very much easier to get a prosecution when they are in possession of marijuana
8653543 there comes a point where you have to put your foot down
8653544 fed up with folks dumping bales and walking for it in my knowledge this is the first time in the county weve done this
8653545 theyre stuck with a boatload of marijuana so they dumped it overboard
8653546 its quite common for people to pick up floating bales
8653547 but because of the proximity and the time of death and a few other indications we have to consider a connection possible
8653548 the defendants are guaranteed one bite from the judicial apple
8653549 they took that bite at the trial of this matter and cannot now be allowed to turn the clock back in order to take a second bite
8653550 each defendant steadfastly represented to this court that they understood their right to a unanimous verdict and that they freely and voluntarily desired to waive that right
8653551 the coercion now claimed is not supported by the facts
8653552 even if he isnt called as a witness his name is going to be mentioned
8653553 well you gt have a very sexy accent indeed but i gt didnt understand a single word that you just said to me

8653706 i also understand hes a footballer who wants to do the best for himself and his family
8653707 weve been in that situation before so any decision he makes is solely for himself and i understand that but in my opinion cassios a player here for the long term

8653722 i think nick has a lot of good leadership qualities which is something we definitely need in our forward pack
8653723 we had the opportunity to let him go he was off contract but we wanted him to stay
8653724 some guys who get it easy sometimes switch on and off but nick doesnt do that because hes had to fight for everything hes got which i admire him for

8653778 queensland has the second most registered football participants we think theres a very strong interest in football but more importantly theres a strong interest in following sport
8653779 i think we can win the league obviously thats going to be up to miron to pull a rabbit out of the hat

8653781 we probably want a few more games before that but thats the way it is
8653782 weve got one game before so well have to go back to our states and work pretty hard and try to do the best we can there to prepare as well as we can for india

8653791 that further vindicated our testing regime from the point of view of making sure that players are given a second chance
8653792 we are determined to have a policy that works we refuse to have a policy that names and shames and benefits no one
8653793 we are determined to put the health and welfare of players first

8653831 id spent 10 years in italy and i learnt a lot there
8653832 im happy that i started my career in that country but it was just getting a little bit stale there

8653835 theres a certain enthusiasm about all the stadiums of england the way that the people enjoy their football
8653836 i think the clubs have invested a lot of money in bringing in the top players and they have improved the football as a consequence
8653837 it is an enthusiastic league to watch the opportunity was there and i thought it would be good to measure myself against such a good league

8653840 alchemy of trading is a bit different from those weve reviewed before although stephen vita posts plenty of breaking market news and related charts vita who has an mba and has been trading professionally for 15 years presents a stream of consciousness in his multiple daily posts also shares commentary on his own portfolio and trades a better tool for experienced investors who can blend this conversation in with their own studied experience

8653846 i will be just trying to tackle him hes a big boy so i dont want to get in the way of him
8653847 were probably letting ourselves and each other down a bit when you lose three in a row you are looking for answers from everywhere
8653848 you dont want to go too far into it and you dont want to over analyse you want to work as a team and focus on the football
8653849 for me its a big game i love playing against souths all my family and friends come out here i know most of the people sitting in the crowd so it gets me going

8653866 the red hook waterfront that some residents complain is already starting to resemble a strip mall with ikea and fairway now firmly rooted is gonna get another big box retail tenant sources said today that they expect developer joe sitt to convert the former revere sugar factory site he owns into a big national chain store
8653867 sitt would need to get a zoning change through the citys land use review process because the retail business he plans to bring would take up more than 10 000 square feet in space
8653868 more warehouse sized retail stores like bj s could be tough to swallow for red hook residents many of whom bitterly opposed the ikea though its impact has not caused the apocalypse some predicted theres more traffic especially on weekends but there have been few complaints
8653869 were willing to take less for shipping because we think youll buy five more items from us as opposed to if we got as much as we could from you shipping this product you may never buy again
8653870 those five areas are software as a service saas global class computing the consumerisation of it web 2 0 and the open source software movement
8653871 people are frustrated with the restrictions placed on them by corporate it departments such as small mailbox sizes when theyre able to get virtually unlimited mailboxes from the likes of google
8653872 those services are either offered virtually for free or individuals are paying for access with their credit cards and getting immediate access that completely bypasses the corporate buying system which favours traditional it companies
8653873 the problem for it departments is that web 2 0 can get messy and it cant be understood in the way it departments have worked
8653874 ill be teaching journeydance regularly at theaterlab up until october stay tuned for the day it will change
8653875 surprising since the only catalyst was apparently a press report suggesting that federal officials are likely to recapitalize the gses soon
8653876 we are not convinced that treasury needs to take any action over the near term
8653877 while the decline in the gses stock prices if they persist may pose challenges to any capital raising efforts down the road the short term stock price performance does not have any bearing on the success of the paulson plan

8653879 theres always been an emphasis in pediatrics on prevention and immunizations are a big part of that but adult medicine has not caught up
8653880 i think people dont realize the number of deaths that occur because of infectious diseases every year
8653881 i think the flu and pneumonia vaccine are grossly underutilized
8653882 because adults havent been immunized against whooping cough in years the illness is now starting to show up in adults and so thats why theres been a new emphasis trying to immunize adults again
8653883 so although it seems were more concerned with heart disease and cancer i think the public needs to know that infectious diseases are still out there and are a potential cause of problems

8653886 the economic development of this country depends on ghana developing industries to produce what we need and selling others to earn foreign money to buy what we need from others
8653887 these shortcomings or defects in our society can be addressed when we improve upon the quality to tvet delivery in our training institutions and it is only relevant and appropriate curricula informed by the needs of industry that will produce relevant and skillful technicians and master crafts persons
8653888 we all want to live in a nice house wear good clothes and drive nice cars but nobody wants to work as an artisan
8653889 we need to change our wrong perception that tvet is only for low achievers and dropouts of the general education to the positive vision that the new tvet is for promising young human resources for the next generation industry as a national foundation

8653895 in some cases operators are charging you for a call of one minute two seconds what they can charge you for two minutes this leads to overcharging on average of 24 percent for calls made and 19 percent for calls received
8653896 the regulation of billing increments within the eurotariff or any other roaming tariff would amount to micro management and would risk further erosion of competitive differentiation in the market
8653897 billing increments are a point of differentiation that operators can use to appeal to customers with different preferences
8653898 this is an issue national regulators have recommended the european commission to address if you tackle this issue you have to tackle it in eu legislation this is something the european commission will consider in the weeks to come

8653902 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
8653903 i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8653904 barack obama is ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8653905 i know you hear that phrase a lot in politics i mean it
8653906 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8653907 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8653908 and president clinton reminded us of what its like when you have a president who actually puts people first thank you
8653909 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8653910 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8653911 you all sit down we have to get on with the show
8653912 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding instincts and insight america will have the national security leadership we need
8653913 the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam
8653914 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8653915 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8653916 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks
8653917 in 2002 ireland passed a tax on plastic grocery bags customers who want them must now pay 33 cents per bag at the register there was an advertising awareness campaign and then something happened that was bigger than the sum of these parts within weeks plastic bag use dropped 94 within a year nearly everyone had bought reusable cloth bags keeping them in offices and in the backs of cars plastic bags were not outlawed but carrying them became socially unacceptable on a par with wearing a fur coat or not cleaning up after ones dog
8653918 compass minerals posted record second quarter revenue and cash flow and generated a second quarter profit for the first time in the companys history this significant achievement illustrates the success of our strategies to strengthen our non winter non seasonal applications coupled with the companys minimal exposure to economic cycles
8653919 we are very optimistic about the growth opportunities for our sulfate of potash specialty fertilizer segment and the solid outlook for our salt segment
8653920 the new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurement because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8653921 the developing world is poorer than we thought but no less successful in the fight against poverty
8653922 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about 1percentage point a year since 1981 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8653923 activity levels improved in the united states in the quarter particularly horizontal drilling on land more than offsetting the seasonal sequential decline in canada drilling activity while the primary driver of increased rig activity in the u s compared to a year ago has been oil directed drilling we expect that our customers will increase the pace of their natural gas directed activity in the second half of 2008 resulting in additional opportunities for baker hughes

8653930 the war could no more have been avoided than an earthquake or any other cataclysm of natures unknown forces to say that a war arises from this or that individual event is folly such empty phrases were part of the old blind statecraft which we have outgrown war springs from human nature
8653931 there never was a war more easy to stop than that which has just wrecked what was left of the world from the previous struggle the human tragedy reaches its climax in the fact that after all the exertions and sacrifices of hundreds of millions of people we still have not found peace or security and that we lie in the grip of even worse perils

8653939 hay un ofrecimiento de aumentar el porcentaje del adicional asistencial hospitalario que conseguimos este a o nosotros conseguimos el 40 del b sico y se elevar a a un 55 y en eso consiste la propuesta salarial que dicho en dinero ser an unos 170 o 180 pesos pero adem s conseguimos que pr ximamente se concrete un viejo pedido nuestro y que consiste en sacar a las profesionales m dicas embarazadas de las tareas de riesgo guardias trabajo en reas de enfermedades infectocontagiosas a partir del quinto mes de gestaci n

8653948 la participaci n del estado cuenta con la integraci n tambi n de los usuarios los prestadores y las propias empresas se busc equilibrio en la elaboraci n del texto del proyecto y el resultado fue una votaci n tambi n equilibrada
8653949 las prepagas van a poder agregar prestaciones a las del pmo pero no reducirlas
8653950 no deber ser un desborde ni la cuota se puede llegar a convertir en un quebranto para la empresa
8653951 las empresas deber n demostrar el nivel de cuotas a cobrar al asociado que tenga una antig edad de 10 a os y cuente con 65 a os edad la cuota no le ser aumentada

8653983 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard is gone
8653984 so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve
8653985 mostly costello kept his disappointment in check refraining from the odd bitter comment would have been heroic virtue in a saint let alone an ambitious politician
8653986 he never challenged because he didnt want to wreck the government in order to lead it

8653988 moving to a consumption based approach without robust global accounting would involve significant risks for a small open economy such as australias

8654000 estas son de lejos las galaxias m s tenues que jam s se han descubierto y la menos luminosa de ellas es la que tiene un mayor predominio de materia oscura de las que conocemos
8654001 puede que tengamos un l mite en c mo puede agruparse la materia oscura y si esto es cierto puede que nos diga algo sobre la propia part cula de la materia oscura
8654002 se puede pensar en un c mulo de materia oscura como en un pozo y cuando m s masivo es el c mulo m s profundo es el pozo y m s dif cil es para la materia normal salir fuera del mismo
8654003 podr a haber c mulos menores pero sus pozos son tan poco profundos que cualquiero materia norma simplemente saldr a fuera
8654004 queremos descubrir si lo que estamos aprendiendo es realmente un l mite a c mo de masivos pueden ser los c mulos de materia oscura o s lo un l mite a la masa de las galaxias
8654005 lo que encuentro realmente desconcertante es bueno qu nos dice esto sobre la f sica es realmente un problema con la formaci n de galaxias o es algo referente a algo m s fundamental sobre la materia oscura es un resultado muy interesante y merece atenci n y algo nuevo sobre lo que pensar tenemos mucho trabajo por hacer

8654058 we want to open up the convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party
8654059 the question for obama is what have you done and what have you run
8654060 he has good oratory but when you shut off the teleprompter theres not much there
8654061 barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world

8654063 we just dont want anybody roaming around with a handgun
8654064 there was a period when suvs were a kind of status symbol and everyone in the suburbs wanted one
8654065 i think that has really changed i think there are a lot of people kind of embarrassed socially now with the kind of car they have
8654066 some of its permanent but some of it is highly dependent on two things the price but probably even as important is personal disposable income
8654067 dont want to be riding around in a hummer when they could be driving something fuel efficient
8654068 even though as prices fall wed expect some increase in travel unfortunately household budgets have been strained by these high prices
8654069 as gas prices came down they could have chosen to go back to the car but for the most part they didnt and gas prices were significantly less then than they are now

8654083 our entertainers dont necessarily need to be an olympic level athlete but olympians bring a certain mastery and intense dedication and focus compared to the others
8654084 they made us climb ropes sit in a hoop and sing and whistle like birds
8654085 the olympics are such a big event and we dont like to interfere with the athletes at the olympics
8654086 its not the best moment to be there to discuss an athletes transition we go to an olympics to see where the sports are going and what direction its taking we already know the coaches and athletes who are interested a lot of scouts are former coaches
8654087 i had no idea what to expect in the audition
8654088 i hadnt seen any of the cirque shows but i had heard of them we had to improvise our choreography but i went in there being the best in the world i knew i was good enough i had just won a gold medal in the olympics
8654089 we take them through to see their physical shape flexibility and their technical specialties
8654090 also we want them to play and have a good time with basic acrobatics
8654091 i was nervous to the point you didnt know what you were doing but after about five minutes of realizing what the director was doing it was more of an improvisational good laugh
8654092 it took me about five minutes to say i can do this it was a tremendous joy the more zany and off the wall i was the more it was a great big laugh
8654093 at the olympics youre training all your life for one big competition
8654094 you cant make mistakes with cirque its not like if you make a mistake youre done for its a lot more fun and competitive sportsmen say all the time that when they hang it up they miss that team feeling i feel very lucky that ive continued that for many years

8654098 she did her homework without being told she ate all her vegetables even the slimy ones and she never talked back to her nanny miss barmy although it was almost impossible to keep quiet some days of course no one can keep this kind of thing up forever but miss barmy had told emmy that if she were a good girl her parents would probably want to see her more often so emmy kept on bravely trying so far it hadnt helped
8654099 these deceptive mailers purposely and unfairly targeted consumers who may have struggled at one time to manage their finances

8654107 our outlook for sales and revenues this year still reflects another record year of growth in sales and revenues to caterpillar and for that matter for earnings
8654108 what is particularly impressive is that we have been able to sustain growth and strong earnings in the face of very severe recessionary conditions in our domestic market in the united states
8654109 we have not seen customers cancel orders to ask to postpone deliveries
8654110 a knowing and willful attempt to violate the strictures of federal election law
8654111 an investigation of the american issues project its officers and directors and its anonymous donors whoever they may be
8654112 this is a sad ploy to circumvent the first amendment by a campaign who has no arguments with the merits of our ad its the classic maneuver if you cant win on the merits file a lawsuit

8654121 in each and every moment mark spent with us on all saints he gave his all
8654122 to have worked with him was a privilege to have been able to call him a friend was a priceless gift
8654123 he had the most extraordinary combination of very deft comic touch and great emotional depth
8654124 i worked with him on stage and on screen and will miss him more than i can say right now
8654125 mark the actor was intuitive and graced every scene in which he appeared with a touch of whimsical genius that only he could apply
8654126 his work as an actor is always inventive and his performance in all saints is a joy to watch
8654127 he proved himself a classic comedian with a natural charm and ability to improvise
8654128 i saw him in a number of other stage productions and am convinced he had a great career ahead of him
8654129 he was surrounded by a close network of friends who were aware of his emotional fragility and gave him all the support they could
8654130 the financial services tax practice has experienced significant expansion in recent years and has worked very hard to produce some great results it is a very exciting time to be leading the team and i am confident that we will maintain out current momentum

8654138 based on the advice and information that i have made my decision on including reports from the csiro and geosciences australia and further independent advice from the chief scientist i am satisfied that the tough conditions attached to this approval will ensure the highest standards of environmental management by the mine operator
8654139 one of those conditions is the requirement that heathgate resources implements a rigorous monitoring program to demonstrate they are meeting the agreed environmental outcomes
8654140 for instance i did oppose the change in policy at the party conference last year but i also made it clear that if it was the democratic will of the party that the three mines policy should change that i would support it

8654152 no school is like another and mr rudd risks creating so called performing schools when a lot of families dont have a choice of schools they can go to
8654153 provide much richer suites of data to all tasmanian parents and school communities without the need for league tables
8654154 what i would say to our friends in the teachers unions across australia and many of them are fantastic people is that its time to arrive in the 21st century
8654155 that is lets get past the name calling lets get past all this pointless debate blaming someone here or blaming someone there
8654156 presumably what some of our friends in the trade unions would like us to do is just hand over a blank cheque well guess what i am not going to do that
8654157 its not right to have a situation where schools have been underfunded for more than a decade now he says come up with the goods or else
8654158 escalating strategies are being considered by the union nationally his plan is too simplistic
8654159 we have some real concerns about adequately funding all schools so we can achieve what the government wants us to achieve
8654160 im glad prime minister rudd and premier bartlett have finally come to their senses and adopted a policy they once vehemently opposed
8654161 the companys result for the 2008 financial year reflects the strengthening of demand for gunns plantation based hardwood products during the year as global competition for wood supply intensified
8654162 while slowing domestic construction activity and increased import competition impacted on our softwood operations late in the financial year we believe this business is well placed to benefit from improved market conditions with reductions in domestic interest rates and a weakening australian dollar
8654163 one of the reasons we need to do them on this sort of scale is because when we conduct our own training and development we can do it within our own agencies
8654164 the important thing about this sort of exercise is we get together with the other agencies and exercise our communication procedures while trying to develop a better understanding of how the other agencies work so collectively we can respond in a more effective way
8654165 whilst the directors believe it is probable that the mill project will proceed to completion the financing structure is yet to be finalised and gunns cannot state with certainty that such a structure will be achievable nor can it provide an assurance that the mill project will proceed
8654166 the board has no evidence at this stage of its investigation that dr kossmanns practise of medicine within the terms of the undertaking poses a risk to the health and safety of the public
8654167 i would like to reiterate i totally reject the flawed findings of the alfred hospital peer review and i see the boards decision as a positive step in fully restoring my professional reputation
8654168 honeybee health and sustainable pollination is a major issue facing american agriculture that is threatening our food supply and endangering our natural environment
8654169 haagen dazs ice cream is made from the finest all natural ingredients and the plight of the honeybee could mean many of the ingredients used in our top flavors like vanilla swiss almond and strawberry would be difficult to source
8654170 we use 100 percent all natural ingredients like strawberries raspberries and almonds which we get from california the bee problem could badly hurt supply
8654171 one third of our nations food supply depends on bee pollination but bees are vanishing in massive numbers this gift will help us to rebuild and revitalize our honeybee program
8654172 thousands of people with dementia are routinely prescribed dangerous antipsychotic drugs
8654173 increasing their chance of death and causing distressing side effects such as excessive sedation motor problems and dizziness
8654174 the latest research funded by the alzheimers research trust suggests that most patients with alzheimers on long term antipsychotic treatment would benefit from having the drugs withdrawn
8654175 that key has been marked as compromised please remove windows from your computer and buy a new copy
8654176 theres a hell of a lot of people to dumb to use a free alternative so most games are still written to run on windows
8654177 my copy of xp and vista is legit though because one came with my laptop and the other came with my desktop
8654178 our research has clearly shown that customers value the ability of windows to alert them when they may have software that is not genuine but they also want the ability to stay up to date with the least effort required on their part
8654179 sure in this case its against unverified copies but how can you be sure there isnt surveillance software in the os in gnu linux you can view all the code and see that there isnt you know exactly what your computer is being used for

8654184 relying exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8654185 the appropriate sides to resolve the existing problems through peaceful dialogue and apply efforts to reconciliation and promotion of negotiations
8654186 the sco member states welcome the adoption in moscow on aug 12 2008 of the six principles of resolving the conflict in south ossetia and support the active role of russia in promoting peace and cooperation in the given region
8654187 serious signal for those are trying to justify the aggression
8654188 the soviet union was not so alone even in 1968
8654189 as of now we can say with confidence that in both regions abkhazia and ossetia ethnic cleansing is fully completed
8654190 theyve expelled from all villages remnants of the georgian destroyed their houses theyve looted their property theyve burned down their fields forests
8654191 consumers have been clamoring for a single device with the most advanced windows mobile software to keep them connected informed and entertained all while looking sleek and sharp

8654194 there is no nato naval build up in the black sea as russian authorities are claiming in the media
8654195 we are trying to draw up a strong text showing our desire not to accept
8654196 just because theyre upset that the little pet of certain western capitals didnt fulfil their expectations
8654197 the sco member states express their deep concern over the recent tensions surrounding the south ossetia question and call for the sides to peacefully resolve existing problems through dialogue
8654198 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance
8654199 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
8654200 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia

8654233 i think the normally shrewd obama campaign has a blind spot about tomorrows big speech at invesco field the pepsi center is the visual home of this convention having obama do his big finish in another venue screws up the visual vernacular of the convention turn off the sound and watch the tape in the end it will look like two different conventions one visually dominated by clintons another by obama that is a message of separation not unity also ask any tv director staging a tv mega event outdoors is very tricky lots of things are hard to control the whole obama speaks to massive crowd thing is impressive but done we ve seen it before finally the mount olympus set looks problematical at best an obama staffer assured me it ll look better tomorrow for their sake it better they should have changed this up yesterday and moved to a more intimate man in the arena set up back in the pepsi center obama is the nominee he should own this house
8654234 bishop samuel aquila of fargo north dakota has joined several other u s catholic bishops in refuting nancy pelosis recent comments that confuse the churchs teachings about when life begins and abortion rep pelosi meanwhile said through her spokesman that she stands by her comments as your bishop aquila continued i have the responsibility to present to you the authentic teaching of the church to correct the misinformation she has given and finally to warn you that those who oppose the true teaching are not in good standing with the church aquila also addressed the issue of catholics who support so called abortion rights these catholics he said support a false right promote a culture of death and are guided by the father of lies rather than by the light and truth of jesus christ aquila also stressed that catholics who support these rights have placed himself or herself outside of visible unity with the church and thus should refrain from receiving holy communion out of respect for the teaching of jesus christ and the church
8654235 while pelosi spokesman brendan daly could not deny that catholic teaching is unambiguous about life beginning at conception he tried to bolster pelosi by saying that many catholics do not agree with the churchs teaching
8654236 late on wednesday afternoon the number of bishops criticizing nancy pelosis comments grew as archbishop jose gomez of san antonio and his auxiliary bishop oscar cantu added their voices
8654237 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years

8654246 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8654247 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8654248 saint augustine wondered about the stages of human development before birth how this related to the question of ensoulment and what it meant for life in the kingdom of god
8654249 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society

8654275 for blocking purposes the paymaster has to tell the producer each week who theyre voting off thats so they get the right shot but i dont like to know that information because it sort of helps with authenticity this way my reaction is real the way that everything was going and the way toasteee was talking i just assumed that whiteboy was going to go that was the smart choice why wouldnt she get rid of whiteboy as soon as she said 12 pack youre gone boom i stamped whiteboys check it was me being ahead of myself

8654289 israel missed a chance to learn from the most influential musicians of the decade and the beatles missed an opportunity to reach out to one of the most passionate audiences in the world
8654290 after my father was unable to listen to the beatles
8654291 its a nice story in this case much nicer than the truth
8654292 this is huge for district 2 we are defined as a growth centre in the regional plan and we need to look at what the communitys needs are right now its future needs and development as of right
8654293 what impact will all that have on our existing roadways
8654294 years ago they discussed the possibility of having an on off ramp egress on the 102 somewhere up in wellington would it be feasible to build another entrance to the highway
8654295 this will look at that kind of question again if they put that there would traffic really go that way we need to study the movement how are people going to work what routes are they taking
8654296 if youre in bedford or sackville and work at dartmouth crossing youre now coming to exit 5 in fall river and on the 118
8654297 if you live in sackville there are two ways youre going to burnside and thats through magazine hill or the 102 118 fall river im not saying dont drive through our district but we need help here people
8654298 this study is important because we need good information and due diligence to make sure we make good decisions
8654299 this isnt a small thing were talking millions and millions of dollars for this kind of infrastructure
8654300 there were at least 12 of us in a group wearing pink t shirts with 80s queen printed on them we were dancing and singing it was awesome
8654301 there were no big line ups for drink tickets or bathrooms
8654302 and i really liked the bus ride to the concert everyone on the bus was pumped for the show
8654303 chilliwack wasnt bad but you could tell haywire was really into the crowd
8654304 any money we do make goes back in the pot for next year
8654305 the feeling from the stage was electric and the feeling from the crowd was electric all the bands asked if they could come back again
8654306 next year people will be able to go on the website and vote for their favourite band
8654307 i have learned so much about the merchant navy these guys had a terrible fight just getting recognized what these guys did during the war was quite incredible
8654308 what better place to do this memorial than at dewolf park where were looking right out where the convoys were
8654309 i was thinking of water anchors and propellers people were looking at me like i had two or three heads
8654310 but when nobody came up with anything better i pursued it went to bruce and we went from there
8654311 that park is going to be one piece richer than it was before we got there
8654312 anyone going to take a photo of the bedford basin will be able to use that anchor as a focal point and it makes the park more meaningful
8654313 its called bedford d 250 but all the surrounding communities like sackville fall river hammonds plains and waverley are part of this history
8654314 the neat thing about d 250 is youd think it was all about politics and politicians but in their charter theyve said theyre also reaching out to honour our veterans and todays military
8654315 well be doing that and creating something for future generations to enjoy

8654320 we are convinced the inquiry and trial that led to reginald being sentenced to death reveal an abuse of the law errors of form and procedural flaws
8654321 we are convinced the us judicial system which still makes use of the death penalty too often makes legal errors and procedural flaws
8654322 the law decides whether a human being should live or die with a margin of error that is inevitably high and often linked to social and personal bias as well as to the inmates previous record and race all this in defiance of article 15 of the universal declaration of human rights we ask ourselves how many other innocent people will be put to death by the executioner before the death penalty is abolished and a respect of life is re established
8654323 we are able to demonstrate an incredible sequence of errors and violations of human rights in reginald blantons case
8654324 but we also wish to reassert the need to promote in all areas the abolition of the death penalty
8654325 es un error pensar que el cerebro lo hace todo y que nuestras experiencias conscientes son simples reflejos de la actividad cerebral lo que constituye una visi n filos fica com n si fuera as nuestros estados conscientes no ser an m s que espectadores pasivos de las actividades que realiza el mecanismo neuronal del cerebro nuestra creencia de que realmente somos capaces de adoptar decisiones y tenemos control sobre nuestras acciones no ser a m s que ilusi n somos una combinaci n de dos cosas o entidades nuestro cerebro por una parte y nuestra propia conciencia por otra el cerebro nos provee como personas conscientes de las l neas de comunicaci n con el mundo material
8654326 el determinismo no puede ser verdadero porque si lo fuera no considerar amos los argumentos de los deterministas como reales sino como reflejos condicionados s lo un agente libre puede ser racional el razonamiento y por tanto la verdad supone la libertad lo mismo acontece con la deliberaci n y con la opci n moral

8654332 but he loves music and likes to sit by the dj
8654333 as far as im concerned with this dance gone its like cancelling christmas to the rest of the world
8654334 the only reason they gave me for not letting us use the hall is that they would like to keep the space open and available for other things
8654335 then he wished us all the best in the future
8654336 a teacher asked me to help plan a dance the kids had so much fun we decided to continue them
8654337 they dont get to go to movies or go shopping this is their event and its the only socialization some of them get
8654338 theyre the most loving group of people ive ever seen i just cant believe the church has shut the door on them
8654339 its hard to move the people that come to these dances are comfortable at the hall they dont adjust well to change
8654340 for many people this is the high point of their month you can see it in their faces theres one couple that are both in wheelchairs and each month they just wait for the other to arrive and then they dance together all night
8654341 if they had problems with us i wish they would have let us know i would have loved to sit down and discuss this
8654342 helen makes sure there are new tablecloths fresh flowers and balloons etc to go with whatever theme is that month some nights shes there until 2 a m getting the place ready
8654343 some people might think no one would notice but they do and they deserve it more than you and i
8654344 they start getting ready at 4 p m then the access a bus picks them up for the dance at 7 p m they just love it this is a very sad thing
8654345 i have five nephews and two little nieces that i havent seen and obviously the rest of my family too so i think the first thing ill do is just have a little chill out session with them
8654346 i think its probably my favourite song and it means a lot for me coming from the east coast and nova scotia
8654347 i think everybody no matter where youre from can relate to that song
8654348 hopefully someday me and joel will cross paths and ill get to say thanks
8654349 its a cover show so i think its hard to come across as the artist that you want to be because you have to play the ball game when youre searching for votes and play songs that are a little more mainstream
8654350 i think ive done a good job of balancing out some of the not so well known tunes from the jay hawks and joel plaskett with songs everyone knows like during beatles week
8654351 im trying to be true to myself rather than just playing top 10 hits the whole way though
8654352 its been an honour to be a part of such an amazing group of artists
8654353 its been busy and overwhelming but i think its important to keep the fun factor there when you hit the stage to perform if youre not having fun then its just not worth it
8654354 earl id have to say spontaneous drew is genuine and theo is dedicated
8654355 i guess that just shows how much the east coast likes to support
8654356 its a crazy cool experience and im just enjoying the ride
8654357 we think theyre all great finalists but of course were cheering for mitch

8654399 today as we are about to enter the holy month of ramadan i urge the international community and in particular the global muslim community to exercise their moral and religious duty in support of the somali people
8654400 i saw women and children in bad conditions sometimes under the shade of a tree with no food
8654401 i am here to add my voice to the silent cry of millions of somalis
8654402 more importantly it the violence has a wider impact in terms of creating an economic crisis
8654403 we have no option but to do more and do it better
8654404 we have to invest in the security of our staff but that comes at a cost
8654405 its a beautiful instrument its a great program its a great department ive not had a bad teacher yet
8654406 the story of the pianos is one with many greats
8654407 great for the students enrolled at uwg and for future music students great for the performances that the university will produce and that many will hear and appreciate
8654408 becoming a kawai epic institution will have an astounding impact on the daily life of students and faculty
8654409 it affords access to the highest levels of music making provides for the basic necessities of instruction and greatly increases our visibility within the musical community
8654410 jesus will be watching your audition and judging you for all eternity
8654411 see the work you do if it truly matters becomes a part of you
8654412 like the mechanic who never really loses the oil stains under his fingernails our work stays with us wherever we go it becomes a part of our language and our very being which isnt to say work is everything but if your work is your calling not just your job you will embrace it in everything you do
8654413 with the internet with cable with the 15 000 journalists that we have here so many more people can experience it
8654414 being here on the ground to be part of that kind of change is something im glad is televised
8654415 its about developing the skills and developing the intellect and it teaches you how to be competitive
8654416 its being among all these democrats you know everybody thinks the way you think you can get into a conversation about things that are important for you and know youre not going to get into a confrontation
8654417 if youre a guest you cant sit in these seats
8654418 the peace and order of society is more important than even the relief of the miserable
8654419 the special products provision alone could effectively negate any market access gains that might occur from a formula tariff cut
8654420 it allows developing countries to designate 12 percent to 13 percent of their tariff lines as special to take no tariff cuts on 5 percent of lines and to take only a 10 percent cut in tariffs on special products overall
8654421 to put this in perspective a 10 percent cut in a 40 percent ad valorem tariff leaves a 36 percent ad valorem tariff most economists agree that a developing country could use this level of special product provisions to shield virtually all economically significant tariff lines
8654422 in addition to this and other loopholes the lamy proposal would have allowed developing countries to use a special safeguard mechanism to increase tariffs in some instances to levels that are higher than the bound tariff rates currently in place
8654423 in other words the proposal could decrease market access for agriculture
8654424 it would have been a bizarre outcome if the united states brought back a negotiating text that actually decreased market access for some us agriculture exports
8654425 u s agricultures message to u s negotiators was clear
8654426 the united states is giving up 34 billion in allowable domestic support while getting virtually no market access in return and while allowing china to essentially take a free ride through these negotiations this is unacceptable
8654427 there would be no credible argument that there was a balance between u s domestic support reductions and market access gains the lamy proposal seems to prove that a doha agreement based on the falconer text will leave worldwide agriculture with a skewed set of trade rules substantially in favor of large developing countries such as china and brazil named for new zealands crawford falconer chairman of the doha agricultural committee
8654428 the fact he almost succeeded is a testament to lamys considerable influence and determination
8654429 the fact that the united states almost found itself with a doha agreement that no segment of the u s economy could root for demonstrates how far off course this negotiation has gone
8654430 as a result the united states entered the geneva meetings with little chance of closing enough of these loopholes to make a difference still administration negotiators went to geneva with optimism and worked extremely hard for a deal
8654431 blocking my site is a move by a desperate government that is trying to silence me but its not going to stop me
8654432 it only reveals that the government does not know how to handle the internet
8654433 everyone is subject to the law even websites and blogs
8654434 if it can happen to raja petra it can also happen to other bloggers
8654435 in a democracy we dont have to agree with each other but we must defend the right of everyone to speak up including raja petra and other voices of dissent
8654436 intend to curtail peoples freedom or right to express themselves
8654437 its swinging like somebody caught in a tree and thats when you can really see the cabling and its the exact shape of a body same size everything but its just covered in moss
8654438 its exactly what it looks like just somebody caught in a harness in a seat harness
8654439 someone else with a vagina were sure to become bffs
8654440 actually i have a feeling you might get on better with the lads
8654441 i get kind of emotional sometimes if i hit a bad shot here i might let that affect another shot there
8654442 for cole becoming a more consistent golfer will mean being very scheduled as far as preparation
8654443 in the past he was a little sporadic and now his preparation has become much more disciplined he is also improving his mental game he used to fluctuate in mood swings and attitude if he was playing well he was doing great if he got off to a bad start he would immediately start pressing and get upset with himself
8654444 hopefully i can break out this year and get it
8654445 you have to set your goals high you cant think less than being one of the top teams in the big ten and realistically we have a shot my goal is to finish in the top five individually and as a team finish in the top three
8654446 you cant think less than being one of the top teams in the big ten and realistically we have a shot my goal is to finish in the top five individually and as a team finish in the top three
8654447 he sees himself as a great player and thats what allows him to play no 1 at the university of iowa that translates into helping his teammates to have confidence at bigger tournaments that confidence is necessary if you dont feel like you can compete then youre not going to cole always feels like hes the best player out there
8654448 it seems like yesterday when i was looking up to the older players
8654449 you respect guys who can shoot better scores that you i would like to see continued progress with coles preparation attitude and setting a good example for the younger guys hes going to be looked to a lot for leadership
8654450 as soon as i graduate im going to turn pro
8654451 i feel if i dont turn pro ive wasted 18 years of my life i cant wait after ive worked so hard for something
8654452 cole is very focused on going to the next level because i know his goal is to play professional golf
8654453 its going to be about living a clean lifestyle so that when he gets out on tour he can treat it like a business and not just play time out there he has very good support from his family hes shown he can shoot the kind of numbers that it takes to win money at the professional level
8654454 i hate finishing second my dad taught me to be confident and hes confident my coach is confident and all that kind of rubs off on me being confident is a big part of golf if youre not confident in yourself youre already in second place
8654455 my dad taught me to be confident and hes confident my coach is confident and all that kind of rubs off on me being confident is a big part of golf if youre not confident in yourself youre already in second place
8654456 there was a 180 degree turn from when i first got here
8654457 hes so positive and confident in us whatever we need hes there coach makes everyone better he learns from us and we learn from him my first two years were kind of stressful trying to balance school social life and golf it just didnt seem like i was at a division i golf school now it is so fun and so competitive i think coach hankins does a great job
8654458 those 36 hole days last 10 hours and by the last 10 holes some guys are huffing and puffing and you have to be physically tough to finish
8654459 when im standing on the last couple holes and i know i have to hit a certain shot i know i can hit it because ive done it over and over again coach has us in good enough shape to hit that shot in the past i would be so tired i wouldnt commit to my shot and i couldnt hit it
8654460 hes been one of the hardest workers in the workout room getting up early for practice and making sure hes ready to play a tournament im hoping hell continue to grow in that area and be a leader on our team
8654461 were on target to have a go at the irish st leger then down to melbourne
8654462 hopefully hell get 54 kilos for the melbourne cup which is about 8st 4lb 8st 5lb hell think hes running a little bit loose
8654463 the weights for the melbourne cup come out next wednesday and i hope he remains on about 54 kilos and the handicapper doesnt look at the ebor and put him up a couple of kilos
8654464 ill keep my fingers crossed if he got in with 8st 4lb or 5lb it will be worth going down there because hed have a good chance
8654465 we decided that steven would play through the pain against liege and then have the operation
8654466 i can assure you that there have been no offers
8654467 we may not be the favourites for the league but i think that we can cause real madrid and barcelona a surprise
8654468 i think this sevilla squad is stronger than it has been in previous seasons and we always want to beat the teams that are going for the title
8654469 the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
8654470 it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
8654471 he is a man of the cloth and so a lot of people dont want to think badly of him but frankly if someone has a huge crop of cannabis in their back garden its highly unlikely they are just sitting there admiring its horticultural properties

8654474 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8654475 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8654476 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8654477 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8654478 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8654479 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8654480 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8654481 many of the review submissions thought that the standard of english required was too high and discriminated against non english speaking migrants of which there are of course an increasing number mr woolcott said
8654482 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8654483 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8654491 people talk about asian and pacific islanders as though we are one homogeneous group we are not but thats our strength it doesnt matter its about us coming together and making a difference by getting barack obama elected
8654492 but there is something about coming from that part of the world that unites us
8654493 the issues that makes us one people people dont tend to hear it and its issues about education its issues about health care its issues about access to opportunity

8654514 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8654515 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8654516 an unprecedented opportunity for a community that is underrepresented on television
8654517 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8654518 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8654519 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8654520 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8654521 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8654522 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8654523 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8654524 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

8654552 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8654573 while we are saddened with his departure we are heartened that our colleague will have the opportunity to make a major impact on higher education not only in kentucky but across the nation
8654574 this is a tremendous opportunity for him and we know he will be extremely successful
8654575 i am deeply grateful for the opportunity the council on postsecondary education has provided me over the last decade to be a part of one of the most innovative and successful postsecondary education reform efforts in american

8654616 for example cross site scripting comprised roughly 23 percent of the total application vulnerability volume yet this vulnerability is very common in proprietary web applications

8654625 het was ontzettend moeilijk om de zaak draaiende te houden omdat de verbindingen binnen georgi plat lagen mensen die niet in de hoofdstad op loopafstand van het radiostation woonden konden hun werk niet bereiken
8654626 het radiostation bleef 24 uur per etmaal in de lucht het draaide vooral georgische muziek de mensen die in deze zorgelijke situatie naar radio muza luisterden vonden daar sterkte in
8654627 maar er is nog geen deskundige ter plekke geweest dus wij weten niet waar die beschadiging precies uit bestaat
8654628 zij weet niet waar haar grootvader is hij zat in zuid osseti en moest schuilen voor de bombardementen de familie weet niet wat er van hem geworden is en kan dat ook niet zelf nagaan
8654629 dat bestond daar nog niet ook al was er een behoorlijk ontwikkeld muziekleven zij zocht iemand die dat kon net op het moment dat ik met pensioen zou gaan bij de wereldomroep
8654630 ik heb in georgi gekeken naar de muzikale omgeving waarin het radiostation zou kunnen werken ik maakte kennis met orkesten het conservatorium de opera en de publieke omroep in georgi op basis daarvan heb ik een plan geschreven
8654631 het is onvermijdelijk als je zon land kent en daar nog geen maand geleden hebt rondgelopen dat je je zorgen maakt over het lot van al die vrienden en het hele georgische volk
8654632 het is een heel bijzonder volk ze hebben een eigen taal met een eigen schrift dat met geen enkel ander schrift is te vergelijken ze hebben een unieke muziekcultuur ze zijn buitengewoon gastvrij trots op wie ze zijn en wat ze hebben en ze staan in het leven met een soort nonchalante franse slag die vaak heel moeilijk is in de praktijk maar ook weer buitengewoon charmant
8654633 het hoort bij de georgische traditie dat ieder kind van zijn ouders leert om driestemmig te zingen dat kunnen ze ook allemaal
8654634 en als je het geluk hebt om te worden uitgenodigd bij een georgische maaltijd is het onvermijdelijk dat verschillende mensen een georgisch lied inzetten en dat andere partijen aan tafel invallen met een tweede en een derde stem dat gebeurt onder alle omstandigheden ook als het personeel van het radiostation aan het einde van de week samenkomt ze zitten bij elkaar iemand zet een lied in een ander pakt een gitaar en in no time hoor je dit soort klanken om je heen
8654635 niet dat muziek van beroemde russische componisten nu gevoelig ligt maar de afgelopen weken lag er wel een heel sterk accent op het versterken van de patriottische gevoelens van de luisteraars dus is er veel oorspronkelijke georgische muziek gedraaid muziek die troost kon brengen en inspeelde op de gevoelens van de luisteraars
8654636 dat geeft georgi de mogelijkheid te horen wat er in de wereld van de klassieke muziek gebeurt
8654637 andersom is er een groot potentieel aan zangers instrumentalisten en componisten in georgi die het verdienen om in de rest van de wereld gehoord te worden

8654639 i think its going to be through attrition through some kind of incentive hopefully through attrition we wont have to have a reduction in force
8654640 but these results clearly show that this is not the case especially in terms of one of the key drivers of firm profitability loyalty
8654641 it would be a grave mistake to think that because prices are falling property is becoming more affordable as a result
8654642 house prices have soared by over 170 on average over the last decade and remain at a historically high level with the average house still costing nine times average incomes
8654643 and far from helping first time buyers the credit crunch has made it harder than ever to get a foot on the property ladder as mortgages offers have slumped to an historic low and locked millions out of the market
8654644 it is with extreme reluctance that we have had to resort to the need for eviction in the case of mr and mrs sims
8654645 this decision has only been made after every other avenue has been explored it is extremely rare for the agency to evict people from their homes when acquiring land for a road scheme but unfortunately in this instance we have no alternative
8654646 the agency its contractor and the district valuer have offered extensive support to mr and mrs sims
8654647 mr sims had made repeated threats to use firearms and explosives to stay in the property we had to take these threats seriously
8654648 every effort was made to effect a peaceful eviction unfortunately mr sims became aggressive and abusive and was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace he was released seven hours later without charge
8654649 he was kept in custody for this period of time to enable the enforcement officers to clear the property and secure it

8654711 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears

8654713 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8654714 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8654715 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8654716 and if at all possible we wanted to get the obama campaign to get their side of the story
8654717 thats why the uproar is kind of amazing because we wanted the obama campaigns take as well
8654718 were very excited about the forum which we have packed full of vital information about the international market place it is a fantastic opportunity to learn the latest industry news and get up to speed with market trends as well as get hints and tips from the experts
8654719 as a result of developments in technology cheaper air travel and peoples changing attitudes to buying a home abroad buying overseas property is no longer an opportunity available only to the rich or famous
8654720 it has become increasingly popular in recent years and changes to legislation have made it easier to get a mortgage in certain countries particularly within the eu
8654721 mri sells 20 000 properties each year in 18 countries around the world including the usa cape verde egypt the bahamas and of course europe with french and spanish property still popular alongside newer favourites like bulgaria and romania
8654722 it has offices all over the world so buyers can get the advice and assistance they need at every stage of the process including after sales care they can even manage the property if the owner decides to rent it out and help them to sell it on in the future
8654723 bearing in mind that 2007 was a record year for emigration the fact that even more people are looking to move abroad this year shows that there is now a very real desire to escape some of the problems in the uk economy
8654724 however the problem many people are being confronted with is a simple one they cannot sell their uk property and without this equity from the sale of a house they dont think they can fund their dream move and so are putting their move off
8654725 our actual bookings for removals year to date are down on last year
8654726 frustrated brits consider remortgaging and then letting out their property in the uk releasing enough equity to fund the first 12 months of their move abroad
8654727 this also has the benefit of allowing migr s the opportunity to decide which area of the new country they want to live in prior to making a commitment to purchase
8654728 also if for some reason things dont work out as expected and migr s want to return home it is simpler to return to the uk and avoid all the purchase costs such as stamp duty and estate agents costs of buying a new home
8654729 for a rented property to pay for itself then migr s need to secure a rental income of at least 1 25 times the mortgage payments however some deals allow as little as 1 1 times
8654730 they should also change from a residential to a buy to let mortgage which is fairly straightforward as long as you have 25 per cent equity in the property although some lenders will allow as little as 15 per cent on some products
8654731 however buy to let mortgages can sometimes have higher fees so migr s need to seek independent financial advice to check that remortgaging is the best option for them and the mortgage product best fits their needs
8654732 provide a safe and secure process for buying properties in spain
8654733 buyers would like nothing better than upfront reassurance that their dream home abroad has been built in accordance with planning rules and regulations and theyre not going to be burdened with a poor or unenforceable contract after handing over their reservation deposit
8654734 in addition all the necessary legal documents will have been gathered ready to send on to the purchasers lawyer making conveyancing cheaper and faster and a check is also made on the solvency of the developer
8654735 many of the negative reports about spanish property have been overstated
8654736 the sbe will help to restore confidence and ensure that the purchase is secure and legally above board
8654737 remortgaging an overseas property can help to pay off uk or foreign debt finance further property investment or possibly reduce ones future inheritance tax liability
8654738 the strong euro means demand for european property has decreased so owners are finding it more difficult to cash in their asset one solution is to remortgage their property in europe where interest rates are lower and use the currency boosted proceeds to repay debt in the uk
8654739 weve built up a large portfolio of overseas lenders who not only assist with mortgages for house purchase but can now also assist our clients with the refinancing of existing residential properties in 15 countries and we hope to expand this list in the future

8654856 we have the olympics next and it seems like the whole country was watching beijing so gateshead is an ideal chance to start the journey to 2012
8654857 from an athletes point of view everyone who competed in beijing now realises that they are on show for the next four years so will be keen to impress
8654858 i cant wait for next sunday and i am pretty sure most of the athletes will be feeling the same
8654859 the north east is a sporting region there will be a great crowd a party atmosphere and i am expecting a warm welcome for all the athletes taking part
8654860 team gb as a whole did well and within that there was christine ohuruogu germaine mason phillips idowu and natasha danvers who all won medals
8654861 they won them deservedly and they will be on show at gateshead and i am sure the public will give them the reception they deserve
8654862 those who didnt do quite so well have a chance to put things right so that is a big motivation for them
8654863 it would be for me and i know there are some individuals who will want to prove a few doubters wrong
8654864 but i think the fact that the team gb as a whole did well will guarantee a pretty amazing atmosphere on sunday

8654878 users make their credibility based decisions about the people or organization behind the site based upon the sites overall visual appeal
8654879 users said they were more likely to believe web sites that looked professionally designed
8654880 a picture is worth a thousand words an interface is worth a thousand pictures
8654881 design is so critical it should be on the agenda of every meeting in every single department
8654882 design is not just what it looks like and feels like design is how it works
8654883 beauty and brains pleasure and usability they should go hand in hand
8654884 we require from buildings two kinds of goodness first the doing their practical duty well then that they be graceful and pleasing in doing it
8654885 design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose
8654886 to design is to communicate clearly by whatever means you can control or master
8654887 design is directed toward human beings to design is to solve human problems by identifying them and executing the best solution
8654888 design is the art of gradually applying constraints until only one solution remains
8654889 the greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution
8654890 interactive design is a seamless blend of graphic arts technology and psychology
8654891 leonardo da vinci combined art and science and aesthetics and engineering that kind of unity is needed once again
8654892 we find that people quickly evaluate a site by visual design alone
8654893 true interactivity is not about clicking on icons or downloading files its about encouraging communication
8654894 to dismiss front end design as mere icing is to jeopardize the success of any site
8654895 good designers can create normalcy out of chaos they can clearly communicate ideas through the organizing and manipulating of words and pictures
8654896 the ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak
8654897 the basis for success of media products in addition to their usability and efficiency is often the potential to arouse
8654898 visual appearance is one of the most effective variables for quickly differentiating one application from another
8654899 if a site is perfectly usable but it lacks an elegant and appropriate design style it will fail
8654900 ive been amazed at how often those outside the discipline of design assume that what designers do is decoration good design is problem solving
8654901 like all forms of design visual design is about problem solving not about personal preference or unsupported opinion
8654902 making the simple complicated is commonplace making the complicated simple awesomely simple thats creativity
8654903 the architect should strive continually to simplify the ensemble of the rooms should then be carefully considered that comfort and utility may go hand in hand with beauty
8654904 the location of visual elements in the ui has a huge impact on how the user interprets information
8654905 the design of good houses requires an understanding of both the construction materials and the behavior of real humans
8654906 the fusion of art and technology that we call interface design
8654907 that strange new zone between medium and message that zone we call the interface
8654908 form follows function that has been misunderstood form and function should be one joined in a spiritual union
8654909 questions about whether design is necessary or affordable are quite beside the point design is inevitable the alternative to good design is bad design not no design at all
8654910 science arose from poetry when times change the two can meet again on a higher level as friends
8654911 effective communication is a key factor in the success of your product
8654912 problems with visual design can turn users off so quickly that they never discover all the smart choices you made with navigation or interaction design
8654913 good design is the most important way to differentiate ourselves from our competitors
8654914 where you innovate how you innovate and what you innovate are design problems
8654915 your products run for election every day and good design is critical to winning the campaign
8654916 when people talk about innovation in this decade they really mean design
8654917 design is the fundamental soul of a human made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service
8654918 you cant just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them by the time you get it built theyll want something new
8654919 i prefer design by experts by people who know what they are doing
8654920 the commonality between science and art is in trying to see profoundly to develop strategies of seeing and showing
8654921 design can be art design can be aesthetics design is so simple thats why it is so complicated
8654922 simplicity is not the goal it is the by product of a good idea and modest expectations
8654923 a designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add but when there is nothing left to take away
8654924 truly elegant design incorporates top notch functionality into a simple uncluttered form
8654925 when you take technology and mix it with art you always come up with something innovative
8654926 an enterprises most vital assets lie in its design and other creative capabilities
8654927 business success is always defined by the quality of the overall customer experience
8654928 websites that are hard to use frustrate customers forfeit revenue and erode brands
8654929 its all about one thing creative problem solving to get the story out
8654930 the challenge is about taking things that are infinitely complex and making them simpler and more understandable
8654931 the product is the brand you build brand in our industry through the product and the experience
8654932 design is always about synthesis synthesis of market needs technology trends and business needs
8654933 het doorverkopen van legale tickets is een strijdpunt waar de bureaus voorlopig gelijk krijgen dit geval is pure oplichting
8654934 ik kan wel de eiffeltoren verkopen maar kan hem niet leveren in dat geval is er sprake van oplichting dit optreden wordt niet bevestigd door live nation het is dus speculatie

8654936 a musician must make music an artist must paint a poet must write if he is to be at peace with himself what a man can be he must be this is the need we may call self actualization referring to a persons desire for fulfillment namely to the tendency to become actually what we are potentially
8654937 no stop thinking that way you dont know this person and you know from experience that looks can be deceiving
8654938 while we dont have clout we do have water and we deserve a bigger voice in the future of our most important natural resource
8654939 while we dont have clout we do have water and we deserve a bigger voice in the future of our most important natural resource

8654945 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8654946 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas
8654947 but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8654948 what can i do to pay for my blogs costs without pissing off my subscriber and reader base
8654949 the one thing well continue to do is monitor every day and always reserve the right to do what we think is in his best interest and ours but i think hes doing ok the one thing we dont want him to do and weve told him this about 100 times is pitch with any kind of concern in his head weve kind of beat him over the head with that had him back in there today actually doing it again well just continue to monitor him i know the tingling is gone things like that which is really a good sign especially when he went out and threw so aggressively in the bullpen but well monitor how he feels

8654960 because black people were referred to as colored for so long the museum was being mistaken as just an african american museum
8654961 were trying to give the museum a name that identifies more with what the museum highlights
8654962 its a way for us to highlight past and present hall of famers who have had an influence in our multicultural heritage
8654963 it also lets us tell our story about our western heritage
8654964 the other nominees are people of great accomplishments especially those going into the hall posthumously like cowboy bones hooks
8654965 were willing to take less for shipping because we think youll buy five more items from us as opposed to if we got as much as we could from you shipping this product you may never buy again

8654977 in the past weve been asked a million times about when we were gonna put out a band dvd truthfully we never felt like it was a priority and we didnt want to release something just because the market was asking for it
8654978 the karmacode tour brought us to many different places around the world for the first time and we managed to record some of those great outstanding shows where the interaction with the people was just magic this dvd is a beautiful reminder of where we have been in the past 3 years with all our body mind and soul

8655027 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8655028 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8655029 i always want people to remember me of course as a tennis player as a great tennis player a champion whatever i dont want them to remember me as a clown
8655030 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8655031 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8655032 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8655033 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8655034 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8655035 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

8655037 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8655038 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8655039 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8655040 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8655041 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8655042 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8655043 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8655044 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8655045 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8655046 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8655047 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8655048 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8655049 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8655050 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8655051 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8655052 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8655053 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8655054 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8655055 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8655056 nous voulons que certains pays d velopp s en fassent plus
8655057 la convention des nations unies sur le climat de 1992 nenvisage aucune diff rentiation entre les pays en d veloppement

8655059 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8655060 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8655061 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8655062 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8655063 nous voulons que certains pays d velopp s en fassent plus
8655064 la convention des nations unies sur le climat de 1992 nenvisage aucune diff rentiation entre les pays en d veloppement

8655066 when one door of happiness closes another opens but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been opened for us
8655067 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8655068 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8655069 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8655070 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8655071 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8655072 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8655073 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8655074 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8655075 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8655076 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8655077 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8655078 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8655079 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8655080 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8655081 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8655082 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8655083 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

8655130 it was just about a year ago when i wrote most of you to say that i had decided to fundraise for the leukemia and lymphoma society by training for an ironman i definitely felt like i bit off way more than i could chew which is not a sensation i am used to feeling stepping outside of my comfort zone isnt a favorite pastime of mine and this was a pretty big leap out of mine i didnt own a bike i couldnt swim the length of a pool without stopping to catch my breath and raising 8 000 after fundraising several times over the last 4 years seemed pretty daunting i figured i could do 2 out of the three but i wasnt sure which one would come up short over the last year i trained harder than i ever have in my life i went from blinding fear of swimming in open water to doing 2 mile swims at redwood shores without a wetsuit and doing it happily i went from the sticker shock of purchasing a new bike to riding over 3 000 miles with close to 100 000 feet of elevation i started out working with a team full of strangers and ended up making some of the closest bonds imaginable my teammates are the salt of the earth and there isnt a thing i wouldnt do for them and i know that they would have my back whenever i would need it also its hard to believe i have only known them for a year i pushed myself to limits i never thought possible and certainly not at 40 years old after all thats when you get old right actually im not sure what 40 is supposed to feel like ill have to ask some of those folks who called me crazy over the last year which brings me to most of you p a lot of you thought i was nuts for even attempting this and for a while there i absolutely agreed with you jumping into the bay at treasure island on a sunday morning in january isnt exactly a model of sanity and neither is riding your bike to the top of mt hamilton but that didnt stop all of you from supporting me every stroke pedal and step of the way i wish you all could see the looks on your faces when i would tell you about our weekend workouts only to hear you tell me how crazy i was and then you would always say something supportive in the end you were all great and for those of you who donated to my fundraising i cannot thank you enough i was inspired to do this last year when i learned that my uncle mike was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in the last year i lost him as well as two other people in my life to cancer and leukemia your dollars are going to help those get through their ordeal with these diseases and one day a cure but until that time comes the fight goes on i leave for louisville ky soon and on sunday i will be in the water on the bike and running 26 2 all day long ill have a lot of time to myself and my own thoughts most of which will be of you guys believe it or not your support encouragement jokes and laughter will help drown out the down times in my race as my coach has warned me in ironman you will experience some level of discomfort knowing that you are thinking of me and sending positive vibes my way will get me through whatever that course can throw at me i encourage all of to you follow my progress online below is the link to the ironman louisville site just plug in my name or bib number 1429 and you can see how i am doing you can cheer me on when i am smokin and kick me in the butt when i need one too and know that when i get back i will finally have some time to see you all again and i will have lots of stories to tell you thank you all so very much for your support and understanding over the last year ive had the time of my life and i couldnt have done it without you

8655132 we dont intend to decrease our fare prices when the atf prices drop in september we will wait for the atf prices to stabilise before we think of passing the benefit to customers
8655133 there is a possible drop in atf prices by 10 12 per cent which could translate to about rs 300 400 in fares but we will not immediately cut our fares
8655134 our basic fare structure will remain consistent in the next 45 days between september to october we are neither increasing our fares inspite of the fact that festive season is coming up

8655141 nyatanya itu tidak terjadi terpenting ketika tim meemakai strategi balapan yang agresif dan didukung mobil kompetitif hasilnya akan bagus namun jika anda sendiri tidak yakin apalagi start di posisi terdepan ini potensi menimbulkan kesluitan saat lomba
8655142 tentu saja kami bangga inilah pertama kalinya volkswagen group sebagai industri mobil global berada dalam kelompok tiga besar sekaligus membuktikan bahwa kami berada pada trek yang tepat secara internasional posisi kami semakin kuat meski begitu program utama kami tetap membuat mobil yang diterima oleh pasar secara sistematik kami berhasil menciptakan pertumbuhan meski kondisi pasar sulit

8655158 every four years the question of how to rank countries comes up
8655159 the large number of conflicting rankings attests to the fact that its not easy to present an answer this year some ranking show the u s on top while others show china
8655160 this is some of the best classic rock and roll you will hear anywhere around

8655170 coach walsh said wed have to score at least 14 points to win this game and he was absolutely right
8655171 we failed to move the ball and that was very frustrating
8655172 i feel badly about our inability to run the offense if we had gotten two or three more first downs in the second half we would have won
8655173 tujuan pidatonya adalah menyuarakan ke masyarakat amerika mengenai tantangan yang kita hadapi dan apa yang kita perlukan untuk menyelesaikan masalah itu serta pertaruhan melanjutkan misi yang kita canangkan saat ini

8655177 el penal fallado por windell gabriel rendondear a la p sima noche rojinegra alajuelense
8655178 la liga no pudo ni con un penal cuando el partido estaba a punto de finalizar
8655179 ante un equipo sin nombre sin mucho ataque por no decir ninguno aunque con mucho orden t ctico para defenderse
8655180 secaron a el salvadore o eliseo quintanilla secaron a la liga y se llevaron un empate del morera soto
8655181 los muchachos del islanders perfectos desconocidos en el rea resultaron m s dif ciles de lo que muchos esper bamos
8655182 contaron en realidad con la complicidad alajuelense con sus dificultades para generar opciones de peligro para convertir la posesi n de la pelota en opciones de gol
8655183 qu lo diga quintanilla al salvadore o le pusieron encima una marca personal con la misi n de seguirlo a donde fuera sus celadores no lo acompa aron a la ducha porque no pod an y l ni la liga lograron sacudirse la marca
8655184 un penal desperdiciado por windell gabriel dej a alajuelense con un empate que pone al le n
8655185 el islanders de puerto rico sac un empate y sembr congojas de cara al juego definitivo la pr xima semana
8655186 tener la pelota le sirvi a la liga para dominar el primer tiempo todo ante un rival que se plant al inicio pero su bloque se diluy con el paso de los minutos
8655187 con una rayita el equipo rojinegro patentiz su mejor rendimiento
8655188 para complicar m s la situaci n de los erizos alajuelenses en este partido no podr contar con el volante salvadore o eliseo quintanilla
8655189 el delantero windell gabriel fall ya sobre tiempo un penal lo que le impidi a la liga deportiva alajuelense vencer anoche
8655190 gabriel remat al lado izquierdo del portero william guadette quien rechaz el disparo con lo que el marcador se qued uno a uno
8655191 los visitantes mantuvieron el esquema defensivo al extremo de que su primer remate a marco fue al minuto 41 pero el disparo sali desviado
8655192 ja voll happy urgemein weil der sowieso auch nicht besser ist
8655193 cesc fabregas er spielt sehr intelligent obwohl er noch so jung ist hat das periphere sehen und eine gute bersicht das gef llt mir
8655194 ich will nicht nach einem spiel eine einsch tzung treffen
8655195 pero no por mis palabras sino porque es lo que corresponde despu s de que todos los pilotos de michelin estuvi semos tan mal en brno
8655196 dije lo que sent a no miento ni me invento las cosas pero m s all de eso ellos deber an moverse para mejorar el rendimiento no porque yo me haya quejado
8655197 en 125 y 250 ser a m s f cil en motogp tengo m s dudas no todas las motos son iguales
8655198 pero ahora lo m s importante es estar a la altura no siento nostalgia del inicio del campeonato porque las cosas pasan y ya est y tampoco se puede decir que lo haya echado todo a perder
8655199 una cosa menos de la que preocuparse mejor para ahorrar energ as
8655200 no estoy bien del todo pero embrago con normalidad y ya me puedo sujetar fuerte a la moto
8655201 no es f cil cuando se tiene una pretemporada como la que nosotros hemos tenido en la que a veces te faltan diez hombres por razones diferentes bien por compromisos internacionales o por los juegos ol mpicos
8655202 entonces regresan dos o tres jugadores una semana la siguiente vienen m s
8655203 seguiremos mejorando y estaremos totalmente preparados como equipo cuando comiencen las fases de grupo ya que hasta ahora nos hemos ido preparando para cada partido sin contar con cuatro o cinco jugadores en cada encuentro
8655204 trabajamos para mejorar la plantilla no es f cil fichar a nuevos jugadores a estas alturas con el mercado a punto de cerrar quiz tan s lo podamos traer a uno m s
8655205 embrace the disingenuous charge of elitism or as i prefer to call it maturity by not pretending that everyone is equally special to you remind the people who matter to you that youre always available for them then tell them how to do that including specific instructions n b this is important for relatives who think the internet is just ebay urban myths and joel osteen get a friends only email address get a friends only grandcentral number do whatever it takes to provide a backchannel for your super secret network
8655206 teachers are inherently a skeptical lot not a natural base for the kool aid culture of 21st century electioneering with its cynical smarmy manipulation of language as a start how about the most recent word du jour elitism only an intellectually bankrupt political system would dare to twist such a perfectly good noun into a pejorative a negative a mortal stigma websters defines elite as the choice or most carefully selected part of a group sounds to me like the perfect baseline description of a president
8655207 here it is in brief gifted students hate school because school is a sucking quagmire of mediocrity
8655208 okay i know this hardly qualifies as an original thought but perhaps my personal experiences can enlighten the issue a little bit the mediocrity begins in society but it seems to be concentrated like b o in a cabbies upholstery in schools of education
8655209 the influential 1983 report a nation at risk whose findings have not substantially changed since its publication found that too many teachers are drawn from the bottom quarter of graduating high school and college students those same students become teachers so rather than your kids or my kids being taught by the best and brightest or at least the solidly competent theyre being taught in too many cases by people who essentially werent very good at school
8655210 very significant wage substantial bonus and pension increases and improves benefit programs for active employees and retirees
8655211 while no policy can protect against every possibility we will continue to review our policies and procedures
8655212 i can only guess it was not a high level security holster
8655213 one of the things we do and i certainly hope the department of corrections would too is semiannual reviews on what to do when someone tries to take your gun
8655214 a hospital is a city within a city anything that can happen on main street usa can happen in a hospital
8655215 this is certainly an incident we would be concerned about
8655216 sometimes you dont really address things until something tragic happens
8655217 im sure its being addressed in hospitals all over the state today

8655224 mis representantes me comentaron que el equipo estuvo muy bien es un buen momento para el club y en lo personal tambi n entrar en liga de campeones es importante as que hay buena competici n
8655225 las cuestiones econ micas forman parte de las relaciones entre los clubes y los jugadores no se comentan nunca por nuestra parte
8655226 ive heard so many great things about tel aviv and israel but hearing is one thing and experiencing it for yourself is another we are planning to have a great time and a great evening we cant wait to get out there and rock
8655227 there is no doubt that it was a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform

8655234 you better not ask that question too much so far as i know they havent had a union meeting in two years and theyre not having one soon
8655235 knall pils og d rlige realitystjerner er rektig men i bandet er vi rimelig ihugga fans av godset s du hadde to av tre jeg kaller det tre av tre til gullet havner i drammen lars petter artig med litt gode karakterer innenlands siden vi ikke har sett mange norske reviews
8655236 jeg synes det gikk helt kanon masse utfordringer som det b r v re for pr ve overg seg selv med en mastermind som torstein p musikk vet man bare at det blir bedre og bedre
8655237 skal nok ogs klare overg warring factions n r tiden kommer for ei ny skive
8655238 tja vi har jo et nske om v re noe for seg sj l vi ville liksom ikke la noe st i veien for oss og det gjelder sjangre ogs men det er jo viktig forst at sjangereksperimenteringen ikke er en stor del av helheten men heller at vi bruker forskjellige sjangre for oppn partier som kler skiva best
8655239 det rykker litt i d nsefoten p det partiet der men jeg vil ikke si det er inspirert av noen spesielle artister i alle reviews som har komnet av skiva kom ut har county bluegrass partiet v rt et tema og det liker vi det kommer til ta av helt sykt live det skal jeg skrive under p
8655240 n r vi f rst begynte fundere litt p hvordan v r andre plate skulle h res ut h rte vi jo for oss et helt s regent sound vi har ikke hatt referanser til f rsteplata n r vi har puslet sammen visjonen om skiva men vi har definitert l rt en ting eller to om b de musikk og produksjon men n r det musikalske konseptet var p plass gikk hele prossessen naturlig selv om visjonen har utviklet ogs siden skiva ble p tenkt n r vi skal lage skive g r vi jo ikke rundt og sier fy faen n skal vi lage s r s r obskur prog heh jeg trodde egentlig skiva skulle appellere til en ganske stor m lgruppe men det er fortsatt ikke lettford yelig musikk for mannen i gata men n r jeg ser reviews som beskriver musikken som jazz fusion prog avant garde metal med innslag av country og 80 tallspop skj nner jeg at folk kan bli litt skremt jeg skj nner at noen kan oppfatte skiva som litt i s reste laget men vi synes ikke vi speller sykt spesielle greier det har for det meste kommet naturlig og vi er veldig forn yde med resultatet
8655241 det er en historie som bygger videre p axiom axiom ble skrevet utydelig og upersonlig for sette p mystikk som igjen skulle f lytteren til fundere litt med warring factions gjorde vi det mer lettford yelig og vi satte for eksempel navn p karakterer fra axiom som tidligere bare het the ettellerannet vi nsker fortsatt at lytterne skal fundere litt og historien har en moral som kan tolkes p mange m ter derfor sier vi ikke mer enn det
8655242 vel for v re helt rlig har vi ikke rukket spelle skiva live enda pga at vi jo m ve inn dette faenskapet og det tar tid men til h sten av er vi klare til kicke i gang med nye livespellinger men det har v rt masse selvpromotering plussat plateselskapet har bidratt med sende ut promoer rundt omkring i europa s det har blitt en god del promotering for det
8655243 den saken er biff vi har f tt med oss en vannvittig god musiker p orgel vi har spilt med ham et par ganger p vinger og han kan virkelig sakene sine
8655244 spelle masse live spelle flere skiver you know det band egentlig driver med
8655245 vi leiter etter management og bookingbyr for tiden s jeg h per vi f r den delen i boks snart ogs skal vi jo selvsagt fortsette feie gulvet med resten av musikk norge
8655246 b de g p vre og nedre del av skalaen slik vi liker det
8655247 responsen fra utlandet har v rt mye bedre enn i norge etter min mening spesielt i frankrike har anmeldelsene v rt knall og tyskland har jo ikke v rt langt etter vi burde jo fikse no gigs der nede vi hadde jo en turn i planlegging rundt i europa med et tysk band men hele greia gikk adundas

8655256 there are over 500 school districts in the state so theres no way we could review them all
8655257 what we did is went through and took a sample of schools from rural city suburb and other areas
8655258 it used to be that if timmy was acting like a twit in school hed get in trouble and then everyone would know about it
8655259 even his mother would know about it before he got home from school
8655260 but things arent how they used to be and not everywhere are people knowing whats going on or watching out for each other
8655261 are there things we can do better on of course
8655262 but i think all of us are trying to stay on top of things

8655292 i played in the game nine years ago and beforehand we probably didnt realise the importance of it we had league games the tuesday before and monday after which were the priority but thats not the case this time so theres no excuse we have to go out and win it its a trophy that many of us have never won and thats an incentive for us
8655293 its a big challenge to win the competition any season but the way this teams set up and the players we have means were so unpredictable in the way we attack
8655294 for me looking on last season that was the main difference we had so many players who could change games in attack
8655295 we have a young squad and theres no reason why we cant do it winning the league and champions league puts us into competitions like this and we have much to look forward to our intention is always to win and to do that we have to go out and perform as a team weve done it over the last two seasons consistently and we now have to do it this year if we continue to perform theres no reason why we cant be successful
8655296 winning the first match was important and i was very pleased with that i hope it will help us to be less tense we have played against very strong teams and it was clearly something new to us when we controlled the match in the second half we played much better
8655297 the result might not have gone in our favour but there are a lot of positives that can be taken from the performance we played some very good football had lots of possession and created a lot of chances
8655298 we lacked pace in the first half the second half was again much better of course we want to maintain aspects of our play that already work well and at the same time work to improve things we can do better
8655299 playing scotland and in november wales was something we really wanted meeting british teams will do us good they play very aggressively and we must pass the ball quickly

8655323 it is not necessary that we should have any unexpected extraordinary experiences in meditation this can happen but if it does not it is not a sign that the meditation period has been useless not only at the beginning but repeatedly there will be times when we feel a great spiritual dryness and apathy an aversion even an inability to meditate we dare not be balked by such experiences above all we must not allow them to keep us from adhering to our meditation period with great patience and fidelity it is therefore not good for us to take too seriously the many untoward experiences we have with ourselves in meditation it is here that our old vanity and our illicit claims upon god may creep in by a pious detour as if it were our right to have nothing but elevating and fruitful experiences and as if the discovery of our own inner poverty were quite beneath our dignity with that attitude we shall make no progress

8655466 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8655467 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8655468 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8655469 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8655482 the association believes if members take the action as listed in response to reasonable safety concerns it is not unlawful the desired outcome of the action is for the brumby government to start listening to police about their genuine safety concerns as a result of inadequate resourcing
8655483 estamos apoyando la formaci n de esta ruta ufol gica porque los expertos dicen que esta es una zona caliente para avistamientos
8655484 era un objeto anaranjado que se ubic a unos 400 metros de distancia con movimientos oscilantes
8655485 aqu se han visto impactantes avistamientos de esferas luminosas que descienden en las aguas y en las zonas boscosas sin ninguna explicaci n humana
8655486 en ning n caso podemos asegurarle al turista de que si viene a san clemente ver un ovni
8655487 this is a win win situation for medicine and ethics
8655488 it is really an immensely significant step in regenerative medicine not only because it doesn t involve ethical concerns or embryos or indeed stem cells at all but because if it translates to humans it is work that can be done directly in the body of a living patient
8655489 the late late radio show with tom snyder amp steve mason
8655490 this is really a brand new sport that s really as urban as it gets
8655491 this is really a brand new sport thats really as urban as it gets it will be fun to watch it grow
8655492 i got up to have a look but the moment i got to the door i was attacked suddenly immediately i was struck on the head with a blow which made me totter
8655493 father sergio baldini came to my aid he put himself in front of me to try and defend me but he too was knocked down without mercy they hit him until he stopped crying out then they beat father salvatore and father martin as well it was terrible
8655494 presumably the attackers thought they would find riches at the monastery
8655495 i cannot name the two companies but they are really on the brink and we are doing our best to help them but it is a very difficult task
8655496 it has a massive effect on suppliers and it is fair to say that 3000 jobs could go following the ford losses
8655497 this is a tragic situation for these workers and many companies are facing the position where they want to defer redundancy payments which is not very popular with their employees
8655498 part of it maybe is trying to avoid the peaks with commuters knowing they can be congested and we want to see major investment to alleviate that
8655499 these figures confirm that there has been strong patronage growth not just in peak hours but right across the day
8655500 mid evenings are now particularly busy yet there have been almost no services added at these times in decades
8655501 it may not be possible to run the entire network all night but there needs to be something there to help party goers shift workers get around seven nights a week
8655502 in tough times people wont go and buy a new refrigerator they may not buy a new car or take a trip to paris but they will allow themselves little indulgences
8655503 history has shown they want to get away from their worries and escape to the movies and theme parks they buy dvds and it is all good for us
8655504 we said a year or two back we were going to shift the emphasis of the company to a greater one for theme parks aquariums and water parks
8655505 weve done that and we are looking at other opportunities i hate to take advantage of other peoples misfortunes but if we cant do good deals we wont do any deals
8655506 for the continued progress of the development we are going to pay these fines and move forward with our work
8655507 discharged dredge material and graded approximately 1 622 linear feet of two unnamed turbinates to middle wheeling creek which flows to the ohio river respondent county has violated section 301 a of the clean water act by failing to obtain a permit
8655508 we will just be happy to put all of this behind us
8655509 we communicate with the corps on a regular basis and we are going to do whatever we can to comply with their requests
8655510 al lami was a moderate official and we are surprised by his arrest
8655511 jerry had all his pitches working today the fastball the slowball the ball that starts fast and then slows down right before it reaches the plate and the breaking pitch that starts down the middle and then slowly curves 15 feet outside as the batter begins his swing
8655512 his pitch sequences were set up beautifully he did a great job of throwing pitches inside to make the batter stand in the far corner of the batters box and then coming back with a fastball that painted the outside corner worked every time
8655513 a habit of basing convictions upon evidence and of giving to them only that degree of certainty which the evidence warrants would if it became general cure most of the ills from which the world suffers
8655514 watching stephen harper do his election striptease is not an edifying sight we all know where this is going so why does he have to be so coy please just call the stupid thing and get it over with
8655515 the liberal government will not force an election until they are ready
8655516 its a different kind of hockey to what im used to and obviously playing in the nhl is my ultimate goal so i knew i had to come over early learn all the different rules and get adjusted to the smaller rinks you certainly dont have as much time with the puck as you do in europe so i was thinking that coming over and learning would only benefit me
8655517 ive been in the q for two seasons and wanted to get to that next level so when the swedish team called and wanted me i really felt playing senior hockey on that level would only enhance my skills
8655518 i signed for one year and hopefully when i come back to north america ill be ready to take that next step with the flyers
8655519 when i return to sweden ill continue to play the style of game that i learned in north america because thats why the flyers drafted me and thats what the flyers staff wants me to do ill continue to showcase my quickness and square me shoulder to the net when given the chance
8655520 going back to sweden doesnt mean that hed be out of our plans but simply that it might be a better fit for him right now
8655521 hes at a point where we have to decide what is best for his development
8655522 my coach at st johns real paiement taught me how to play good defense and thats something ill certainly take with me
8655523 in europe i was more like a guy with great speed who would look to get those chance breakaways but that strategy didnt work out so well in north america as it did in europe so i had to learn to play a little bit different and it was a great learning experience
8655524 coach paiement actually named me assistant captain in my first season and that was something i didnt expect at all especially since i was just coming over from sweden and my english wasnt very good but coach told me that he wanted me to be an assistant because i showed good respect for the game and i always gave it 100 percent and those are the qualities i want to bring to the flyers some day in the locker room im a little bit laid back and quiet and really having the a on your jersey is much like an assistant coach you just have to pick your spots and lead by example
8655525 my goal is to play with the flyers and im going to do everything i can to make that happen
8655526 the new rules in the nhl can only help me im not very big so if i continue to move my feet and make things happen ill be able to draw a lot of penalties for our team and then get some time on the power play and score some goals
8655527 my goal is to play with the flyers and im going to do everything i can to make that happen
8655528 i have my own style but ill try and watch how other great players do it like pavel bure and marion gaborik speed mario lemieux the shortest distance to the goal and mikael renberg grinder
8655529 i enjoy playing for the fans and try and watch players with a similar style to mine it gives me more ideas and things to work on
8655530 i dont think he tends to get the credit he deserves as a two way player because he is often looked at as just an offensive player but he played for us in all situations in 2007 08 including the penalty kill hes the type of player that i think will have a role as a situational player even if he is not a big offensive player because he is very versatile
8655531 he definitely has very good skill quick feet and goes to the net hard
8655532 hes very noticeable out there and i really feel he has a good future in front of him so long as he continued to work hard and improve
8655533 there were permits applied for and there were permit time lines and we thought we met all those but apparently they had a different opinion so they issued the penalty and the fine its disappointing that its taken so long on such in our minds such a small issue its been almost a year to resolve that issue thats why were going to chose to pay the fine and move on
8655534 creating the worlds largest train set is a dream of many a thomas fan young and old
8655535 we wanted to design the most magnificent train track in the world
8655536 it was a challenge to build but after a bit of huffing and puffing we have reached our destination and now have a fantastic 1 1 mile long train set
8655537 this is really a brand new sport thats really as urban as it gets it will be fun to watch it grow
8655538 there were permits applied for and there were permit time lines and we thought we met all those but apparently they had a different opinion so they issued the penalty and the fine its disappointing that its taken so long on such in our minds such a small issue its been almost a year to resolve that issue thats why were going to chose to pay the fine and move on
8655539 we congratulate stu on an outstanding playing career and we are very excited that he will now join our coaching staff
8655540 stu was a consummate professional on and off the ice throughout his career and was the type of player who always exhibited the qualities you would associate with a future coach stu will be an excellent addition to our staff which we feel is among the best in the league
8655541 i was truly fortunate to play as long as i did and i knew this was the time for me to wrap up my playing days
8655542 a great opportunity to become an assistant coach was presented to me by the stars and i look forward to making that transition and learning a new part of the game
8655543 no one wants to talk about a problem until theyve got a solution to sell you
8655544 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
8655545 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8655546 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8655547 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8655548 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8655549 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8655550 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8655551 think of it this way the people having the most kids today are uneducated and poor so within a few years we will have a pretty dumb country
8655552 i agree with so many of you but particularly with
8655553 tell this headline to every uneducated person from a third world or
8655554 let this limited children initiative start with the third world countries and the islamic families that are currently trying to out produce the rest of us in order to take over
8655555 i wish i had know this before we had three
8655556 as usual another bible thumper that cannot offer proof to back up his beliefs
8655557 to muttonhead31 since you asked i will respond by repeating myself look around you
8655558 that mountain is not really there everyone is just imagining it
8655559 mixdown it is not a personal attack it is math
8655560 to mixdown you believe there is a god and thats what this country is all about but show me the proof that u speak of
8655561 about the argument over being frugal with resources in having more than two kids
8655562 to the jackal if you cant find proof that god exists then you are blind
8655563 wowsers this from scientists that are generally left of center politically and all in favor of the usa becoming north mexico in a few years
8655564 i recently saw a item on this on pbs and was shocked at how soon this is goign to become a global problem
8655565 i cant believe that people get so up in arms about the suggestion that they not have huge families i have chosen not to have kids and am regularly attacked for the decision by people who do choose to have them
8655566 charlie hustle you should run for president on that platform
8655567 in america we have generations of welfare recipients who beleive the more kids you have the more the government will reward you so why would they ever stop having children besides how else would the women be able to buy those new 24
8655568 i myself have only two children but i resent the premise of these arguments
8655569 it is about time someone took this thought process public in a more aggressive manner
8655570 plea for a politics of consensus serving as a warning against single issue political movements or against the separation of america into racial ethnic or gender based constituencies
8655571 well they ought to do this they ought to do that
8655572 if they asked me id say spend your time in ohio or some of these other states where its going to be very close
8655573 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8655574 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
8655575 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8655576 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
8655577 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
8655578 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8655579 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
8655580 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8655581 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
8655582 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
8655583 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8655584 clinton is the first woman to run for this prestigious office
8655585 in the most recent poll i am ahead by a commanding 1 percent
8655586 right now we are holding a majority by the skin of joe liebermans teeth
8655587 and president obama is going to need a working majority in the senate
8655588 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8655589 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
8655590 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8655591 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
8655592 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8655593 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8655594 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8655595 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8655596 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8655597 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
8655598 the long answer is well ive lived in the philly area for most of my life and i know it well maybe too well so i figure nows my chance to get to know somewhere else l a is sunny and theres good vegetarian food
8655599 not only because people seemed to really appreciate it but because talking to farmers was like some kind of therapy so nice and relaxing made me want to quit journalism and become a farmer
8655600 im hoping california is like one big headhouse market everywhere you look fruits and veggies even if its not that way im going to have a little yard out there and i plan to start a garden so i will send you a tomato and you can decide
8655601 these gaps in the federal environmental safety deserve closer scrutiny and i am examining whether changes are needed
8655602 beim sport kommt man heute nicht mehr umhin werbebotschaften mitzutransportieren
8655603 mit mir hat emig nie dar ber gesprochen dass es einen verschiebebahnhof gab von dem geld einfach abgerufen werden konnte
8655604 squeeze it when right wing policy gets your blood pressure up
8655605 soziale ungerechtigkeit t tet menschen in gro em ma stab
8655606 dies ist ein herausragendes beispiel dessen was berall auf der welt geschehen muss
8655607 from this day on the official language of san marcos will be swedish
8655608 in den 1930er jahren haben fast 100 helgol nder fischer ihren lebensunterhalt durch den hummerfang bestritten
8655609 es gibt offenbar einfach zu wenig tiere als dass er sich aus eigener kraft erholen kann
8655610 aufgrund der jetzigen situation die eine von mir nie f r m glich gehaltene eigendynamik entwickelt hat habe ich mich dazu entschlossen meinen posten zur verf gung zu stellen
8655611 dass er kaum kredit bei den anh ngern hat ist kein geheimnis
8655612 der trainer hat ja deutlich genug kundgetan dass er sich hier nicht wohl f hlt
8655613 dass er den abstieg aus der bundesliga nicht verhindern konnte war die erste gro e entt uschung
8655614 der start in die 2 liga war die zweite entt uschung
8655615 nicht nachvollziehbar f r mich ist nach zwei spieltagen einen trainer komplett infrage zu stellen wider besseren wissens dass eine neu formierte verj ngte mannschaft zeit zur entwicklung braucht
8655616 das kommt berhaupt nicht infrage wir haben einen teuren kader und genug spieler
8655617 you need to take me back there so we can look for my purse
8655618 we have believed all along that weve done a good job and the court has confirmed that
8655619 the contractor will be out there just as quickly as possible were moving
8655620 there will always be some opposition but the majority of the residents in bonner county have been very supportive and its time to move forward with this
8655621 any person or business that is presently selling or offering for sale a used vehicle after having sold or offered for sale five or more used vehicles during the previous twelve months
8655622 talking through the language of the bullet should be stopped
8655623 weve witnessed the positive impact of athletics on a childs life time and time again
8655624 we wanted to give a free camp so that children of all means would have the opportunity to participate we applaud the university of tennessee athletics for getting on board with this effort
8655625 celebrating and remembering knoxvilles history is important each of us can learn from our communitys leaders of the past
8655626 i think its great that were going to see this locomotive restored and back on the tracks in east tennessee
8655627 and im grateful to the old smoky railway museum which owns it and the folks at three rivers rambler for working together to make this happen
8655628 i know we will miss seeing it at chilhowee park but look forward to seeing it restored to its original purpose
8655629 ut students are a vital constituency of the city and i look forward to hearing their suggestions on how city government can better serve their needs
8655630 im also eager to hear how we can work to make knoxville the city of choice for them after they graduate
8655631 how could a wind turbine possibly be bad for you
8655632 hes not going to get off and fight me is he
8655633 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8655634 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8655635 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8655636 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8655637 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8655638 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8655639 this shows a disrespect for the electorate a belief that they are dumb and can be manipulated
8655640 weve taken a unit of work and linked it all together
8655641 our aim is to make it make fun engaging and educational
8655642 my favourite experiment was the hovercraft where you use a balloon with a cd and they spin
8655643 our class has actually been doing science for some time
8655644 you have to sticky tape metal to metal and then the lights comes on like this
8655645 it really lets the kids construct their own understanding and age is no barrier to what they can do
8655646 its kids teaching kids and how to learn in kids language
8655647 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8655648 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8655649 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8655650 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8655651 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8655652 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8655653 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8655654 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8655655 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8655656 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8655657 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8655658 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8655659 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8655660 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8655661 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8655662 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8655663 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8655664 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8655665 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8655666 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8655667 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8655668 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8655669 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8655670 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8655671 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8655672 providing access to improved health and wellness with compassion and respect for all
8655673 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8655674 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8655675 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8655676 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8655677 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8655678 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8655679 it was when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8655680 is just helping people get set up in the morning
8655681 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama i just liked how many people had their signs up
8655682 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8655683 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8655684 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8655685 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life
8655686 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8655687 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8655688 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8655689 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8655690 we recognise a proposal of this type has implications not only for the local area but the region we also believe a genuinely sustainable community stands the best chance of being successful if a broad range of stakeholders in the region feel fully engaged in the process leading up to a decision we believe this is most likely to be achieved through a review of the regional spatial strategy
8655691 unable to even look at the fiasco of the war anymore
8655692 the nation is now just waiting for someone to administer the last rites
8655693 jamie los protagonizadores del programa se dedican a poner a prueba y desmentir todos los
8655694 mccain has himself been critical of the drift of the presidential primary system toward a national primary yet his campaign refused to apply the leadership that would have prevented it
8655695 one of the fundamental principles of the bus is that there is no such thing as a dumb question

8655711 we can put more than 100 000 pages onto a 2 inch square surface
8655712 however thats going to require an expensive reading system but we can do it so it can be read with a 500 power microscope or a 200 power microscope two hundred is much more common it all depends on what people want
8655713 many of these groups are very interested in preserving their data
8655714 we put the bible on a little cross a quarter inch square it is nearly 1 500 pages and you can see it very clearly under 200 power microscope we can even do nano jewelry
8655715 eventually i think this technology will end up in the county seat and the court house and in government agencies like the

8655717 my background is archival preservation so when i found this at los alamos i was excited
8655718 i call it permafilm because it is a much more permanent form of microfilm
8655719 we tried to develop both digital may happen years down the road
8655720 but it is eye readable data that is important to our culture now this is a way of preserving the history of our culture
8655721 depending on the data it takes time to write it with a focused ion beam copies are not as expensive
8655722 i think you captured it perfectly in your last sentence

8655734 this leads me to my conclusion building new cables is the equivalent of adding new roads new shipping lanes or flights the undersea fibers of today are what sea trading routes were in the past an indicator of future economic activity and the subsequent boom

8655739 i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8655740 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me
8655741 he has no idea what is going on in my life samantha has not and would never sell me out
8655742 i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is
8655743 im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living i think its safe to say that there is not now and never will be a tell all written by me
8655744 to have some kind of recognition for a young life well lived
8655745 when you build toll gates its a huge investment and it only covers the main roads
8655746 using gps and gsm in a system like this you could cover all the small roads and the big roads too thats why people find it so interesting
8655747 hai sa vedem daca ne iese hai sa incercam sa invatam ceva din aventura asta hai sa vedem drumurile si solutiile pe care le au ales altii ca sa rezolve provocarea care ne sta inainte asta daca a rezolvat o careva
8655748 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8655749 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8655750 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8655751 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8655752 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8655753 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8655754 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8655755 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8655756 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8655757 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8655758 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8655759 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8655760 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8655761 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8655762 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8655763 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8655764 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8655765 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8655766 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8655767 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8655768 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8655769 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8655770 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8655771 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8655772 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8655773 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8655774 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8655775 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8655776 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8655777 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8655778 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8655779 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8655780 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8655781 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8655782 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8655783 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8655784 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8655785 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8655786 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8655787 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8655788 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8655789 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8655790 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8655791 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8655792 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8655793 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8655794 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8655795 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8655796 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8655797 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8655798 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8655799 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8655800 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8655801 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8655802 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8655803 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8655804 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8655805 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8655806 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8655807 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8655808 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8655809 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8655810 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8655811 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8655812 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8655813 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8655814 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm

8655816 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8655817 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8655818 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8655819 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8655820 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8655821 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8655822 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8655823 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8655824 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8655825 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8655826 formed in 1998 we are a creative agency working with a diverse range of clients from international names to niche markets creating bespoke solutions rather than using one house style
8655827 se hai un sogno nn permettere a nessuno di calpestarlo nemmeno se qst tuo padre

8655830 a papua new guinean father has lopped off his sons hand when a family fight erupted over a bunch of bananas
8655831 it seems that he just had a pen in his hand and they started fighting and at some point during the fight he began to stab the victim
8655832 its really an ugly time and its only going to get worse
8655833 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8655834 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8655835 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8655836 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8655837 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8655838 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8655839 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8655840 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8655841 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8655842 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8655843 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8655844 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8655845 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8655846 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8655847 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8655848 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8655849 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8655850 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side

8655856 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time

8655866 ellisons compensation was already sky high and didnt need to go higher
8655867 the company is hiding behind the fact that they did well in the past year
8655868 we draw you inward in this way beloved orem addressing you and we draw you inward using this line of light energy to be with us and indeed you are welcomed and welcomed with all the other people assembled here who link in and welcomed also by the higher members of the brotherhood and indeed with us in the communication chamber here we have the beings who have come directly through inter dimensional portals to be with you you may sense the change in energy as they move around you and you may sense their light forms insubstantial in terms of a dense physical body yet retaining the shape of a physical form they are with you to hasten your energy adjustment you would find this is necessary for you will realise that there are changes within the inner workings of the earth of the planet indeed shiftings and openings occurring for you to bring forth the higher energy into what is happening you need to receive this greater input from these beings around you so it has been connected to you communicated by you in many little ways to know more and to work more and to be present actively aware of the connections inter dimensionally and so it is that the intersection of that desire has come into form some of you are having difficulty absorbing the higher frequency pattern into what it is that you perform and do and the energy brings you forth into speedy activity and in that way you are out of phase with the ordinary unfoldment and your pace of carrying out your daily duties so there is a point of balance between these two layers required and here you may feel beings working directly connecting you in different ways working on your energy centres working on your memories again what is it that you are remembering and what is it that you think about your early life that you would want to be and what is it that ties you into those memories and thoughts they are of a lower frequency so they will not be absorbed into the higher pattern in the codings that you are immersed in and receiving for this moment here as we do in each transmission allow the energy to be drawn into you to deal with these matters that still occur around you you may feel that you have finished with this but is that so indeed if you are still receiving these messages then you will know there are still memory linkages affecting you indeed as we experience with this voice channel there is continual adjustment into these finer vibrations necessary we draw you here altogether to experience the crystalline energy once more and this is moving deeply into the connections which convey the messages that your body uses to perform its natural functions the energy moving deeply within those communication lines must be allowed to flow and in turn they are awakening that newer pattern of life the new creative force that was brought to you in the previous transmission this is ongoing work yet if this is the first time you have received one of these transmissions you will still receive the benefit of the adjustment by these inter dimensional conscious beings in pursuing your life journey you have come to the point where the opportunities are fully around you and some of you have heard the voices telling you that the portals are open the gateways are open do you recognise these make a conscious effort to move through these with your light form and perhaps you may say just with your mind patterns but they are a great energy which is linked with your greater light form and as you allow that to go before you you physically also go through and feel that you are stepping up and through and being greeted and welcomed into new spaces new light frames this will assist you and you will understand more fully as time evolves around you you comprehend that the earth travels in its orbit as do the other planetary forms and beings and in the turning each part of earth is exposed to a wave of enriched energy in a continuous wave form and so you all are bathed in the same energy frequencies you may experience it in a different light intensity depending on where you are on the planet but it is still being received and currently as the earth rotates it is being measured and it is being assessed for the changes happening and the energy systems that enclose the earth are also being assessed and checked and there is clearance and adjustment occurring there are places being located which will be able to adapt more cleanly to the pattern that comes forth to assist the upliftment of earth and much of what you opened your consciousness to reveal to the councils of light is part of what we are presenting to you in this moment there has been the removal from some areas of disturbing objects and thus there is a more balanced receptor to the energy frameworks coming in a more stable platform to enable these greater inter dimensional beings to come forth and physically be with you upon the earth these ones will speak to people of the brotherhood of love that is necessary to be created upon earth and you have that choice to participate in that universal brotherhood and to be listening to this messages means you already have made that choice and commitment you will recognise that it is also offered to other people around you and you have noticed that they have been given special opportunities and you will have noticed that many did not comprehend that they could change so within this transmission you are given a level of understanding and you will witness much being taken from lands and places and people and you will witness also much being given to a large number of people who work expressing the essence of creation as you know it to be within you you may say it is the inner working of good and support upliftment assistance that you would naturally give to another but where did that come from it was not initiated by you it has existed as part of the creation and there is a great returning to that so this is all about reminding you to turn to absorb the higher energy patterns of love and acceptance and in turn to allow that to go to everyone in your life you will be experiencing in this part of the transmission a drawing forward and upward away from planet earth indeed you visibly may see it beneath you part exposed to sunlight part covered in cloud as you travel beyond that deeper into a different system you are taken collectively as a group of light forms in this journey and you are being invited to participate in a wider programme an expanded programme and link up are you ready to accept this your greater light aspect already has accepted it and you may be aware that there are many of you your self individually present in this aspect of the dimension these are those aspects that you filled with love and acceptance and welcome all these with joy at this time collectively you become a fuller expression of what is termed light it is information projected into experience and materialisation and so you have great knowledge within you because this has been experienced and once something has been experienced it is part of the whole we bring you back now to be in the communication chamber because that level of vibration maintains a different atmosphere and you still need to retain your links with planet earth as it is in its transformation the purpose of taking you into that space was so that you would bring that back into the aspect of you here and therefore it will be connected in to the vibration of the earth station this journey has been extended and you were welcomed through all stages of it and supported and protected you will realise at this stage that these beings have no physical form in their energy form they can materialise to you and they can show you transportation vessels and collection areas of light such as this communication chamber the connections extend well beyond the system where you live now beloved i bring you back to exit from the communication chamber and i embrace you with love and it is with love that you will progress orem out

8655875 i dont want anybody thats been in my life before in my life anymore i dont even want them to have any way of contacting me
8655876 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8655877 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do

8655890 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8655891 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8655892 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8655893 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8655894 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8655895 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8655896 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8655897 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8655898 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8655899 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8655900 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8655901 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8655902 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8655903 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8655904 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8655905 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8655906 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8655907 no my life is not better off in fact it is worse
8655908 i dont use liberal talking points i excrete liberal talking points
8655909 i dont use liberal talking points i create liberal talking points
8655910 he also says listing to his one sided rhetoric that comes to you via radio station filled with one sided propagandist looking to get rich by blindly riding off his coattail
8655911 calypso you speak like a true mind numbed liberal i am going to address your point bullet by bullet
8655912 you talk of how the cia tortures prisoners and yet say nothing of how our people have been tortured and murdered i guess it is not ok to merely waterboard a terrorist who by the way is not subject to the protection of the geneva convention but it is ok to be beheaded by a rusty and dull sword
8655913 do our people get that and what about abu graib do you know what those photos look like saturday night and ted kennedys oh the poor terrorist had to wear panties on his head boo hoo
8655914 show me the proof of the thousands upon thousands of dead civilians that were murdered by saddam just because some code pink moonbat says it doesnt mean it is true please provide any credible report
8655915 an excess mortality of nearly 100 000 deaths was reported in iraq for the period march 2003 september 2004 attributed to the invasion of iraq
8655916 i take it then you were for the surpeme court decision to upholding the decision to negate the dc ban on handguns i mean hey they were protecting the second amendment
8655917 at this point in the war name me all the people affected by the patriot act that were unfairly targeted by the patriot act i bet if bill clinton had wanted the patriot act youd have loved it
8655918 and what is that other than the fact that you hate bush
8655919 force may be used only in a truly just cause and solely for that purpose correcting a suffered wrong is considered a right intention while material gain or maintaining economies is not
8655920 just war conduct should be governed by the principle of minimum force
8655921 were you for or against the war in kosovo and why
8655922 when did this happen i mean in the last ten years bush never did this
8655923 show us the proof why this was pure conjecture there is proof that the military votes were infringed according to the fec
8655924 was that bushs fault what did he do or not do what did the local people do or not do did you know that there was a plan to reinforce the levees and when it came time to do so the environmentalists filed a lawsuit against the army corp of engineers and won thus repventing any more work from happening did you know that instead of using the federal money they got to improve the bilge pumps new orleans officials built a casino the locals had ample changes to either help prevent problems or get people out and they did nothing and they are democrats one and all
8655925 ahhh the swift boat attacks oh boo hoo i have yet to see john kerry sue any of those men for slander or release his military records compared to some of the filth i have seen posted against bush i would say kerry had it easy he could dish it out but he couldnt take it please do find a single thing the swift boat veterans said that wasnt true and post back
8655926 who cares i do give a crap if he unites us or not i want him to follow and implements the republican platform i take it the messiah will unite us wioh that extremely liberal racord fat chance
8655927 what science global warming that isnt science they have proven nothing there is no proof just conjecture they used phony data and no scientific method to prove their claims just alot of bullying tactics alternative energy has been around for 30 years and is has gotten no where nuclear is alernative energy can we use that
8655928 so what he has kept us and you safe id rather have him than some phony who reads a teleprompter well but has no orgininal thought
8655929 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8655930 we komen konijnen tegen in alle kleuren van de regenboog
8655931 sinds dit jaar zien we dat er na kippen en schildpadden steeds meer konijnen worden achtergelaten in het stadspark
8655932 de afgelopen maand hebben we al twaalf konijnen gevangen maar we denken dat er ook nog een stuk of twintig in het stadspark zitten
8655933 als mensen tamme konijnen zien zitten brengt dat hen blijkbaar op idee n we hebben ook al een paar cavias gevangen maar die beestjes kunnen niet overleven in een park ze worden voer voor roofvogels en raken aan de diarree van de verregende boterhammen die ze opeten
8655934 we komen met opzet niet t vaak dan beginnen ze ons te kennen en schieten ze meteen weg als ze onze blauwe overal zien
8655935 gt freshers telecom jobs lt gt tata indicom delhi ncr lt gt icici bank ltd
8655936 the story isnt anna wintour or her behavior its the fact that some people are willing to let her get away with it
8655937 who lets evil bosses get that way and what can we do about it
8655938 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8655939 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8655940 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8655941 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8655942 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8655943 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8655944 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8655945 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8655946 and the difference is evident between belgrades policy towards kosovo and how saakashvilis regime behaved towards south ossetia and abkhazia
8655947 the conflicts were halted in different ways through the ruthless inhumane bombardment of belgrade in the case of kosovo and without punishing tbilisi for its attacks on sukumi abkhazias capital
8655948 a no to the independence of kosovo and a yes to the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia is a stand that does not elicit trust
8655949 in kosovo the west decided to make the rules on what humanitarian intervention meant said that it had the power to do so and decided not to stand by legal arguments in the middle of a genocide
8655950 the makeup of a storm can have all the difference
8655951 slow moving storms have a tendency to churn up underground pipelines so you dont need a category 5 to do a lot of damage
8655952 during a hurricane temporary and sporadic supply interruptions may be unavoidable
8655953 the government will be a lot quicker to release crude oil out of the strategic petroleum reserve should we lose any production

8655961 they have a good record and we havent had any violations issued against them in the last five years on this oasis line

8655994 american military officials sought on wednesday to refute claims that as many as 90 civilians among them 60 children were killed in airstrikes on a village in western afghanistan last friday
8655995 in the face of an investigation by afghan officials and a report by a united nations team that support the high number of deaths united states officials maintain that 25 militants and 5 civilians were killed in airstrikes called in after afghan and american commandos came under heavy fire during a raid on the compound of a top taliban commander

8656092 one of the best ways to find college students is on facebook since thats where they meet and interact with each other
8656093 we found that two thirds of our participants were recruited online either through facebook or through e mail
8656094 studies show that if you have higher perceived knowledge you tend to be tested more
8656095 and that may partially contribute to the higher testing observed among black students in the study
8656096 we couldnt be more pleased with our new hotel and were proud to open one of the most modern lodging facilities in the region
8656097 with our proximity to honda great interstate access and outstanding hampton amenities we hope to be the hotel of choice in southeastern indiana
8656098 we are committed to providing comfort convenience and great value and are dedicated to providing our guests consistently top notch service which we back up with the 100 hampton guarantee
8656099 unfortunately we cannot support advanced bios settings but we recommend you read this article as a guide
8656100 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8656101 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8656102 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8656103 regardless of the mechanism or explanation physicians should be careful when assessing each patients medication needs
8656104 patients also need to take their medications exactly as prescribed after an ami statins in particular should only be withdrawn after an ami under close clinical supervision

8656119 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8656120 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8656121 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8656122 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8656123 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8656124 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8656125 our primary findings suggested that smoking physical inactivity and obesity are inversely associated with awareness of the psa test these risk behaviors are linked with higher prostate cancer morbidity and mortality
8656126 the results concur with our initial hypothesis that men who adopt unhealthy lifestyles may be less concerned with health and less aware of preventive measures like the psa test
8656127 the trial of nine men accused of murdering a young lesbian more than two years ago has been postponed because one of the accused now wants a new attorney
8656128 it is in our view an important step forward to understanding the properties of the mysterious dark matter
8656129 dark matter makes up five times more matter in the universe than ordinary matter this study confirms that we are dealing with a very different kind of matter unlike anything that we are made of and were able to study it in a very powerful collision of two clusters of galaxies

8656138 because of speculation among scientists that viral infections provoke the inflammation that increases the risk of macular degeneration we tested for associations between amd and tlr3 which is known to support innate immunity and host defense
8656139 if you are genetically susceptible to macular degeneration and are exposed to a virus that activates tlr3 it could lead to the death of cells in the macula
8656140 ironically in some individuals using rnai to cure wet amd might actually increase the risk for blindness from dry amd
8656141 these findings pave the way for using tlr3 inhibitors as a potential new therapy for dry amd and simultaneously highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by rnai based therapies
8656142 what tlr3 does in the case of perceived infection is to sacrifice infected cells in this case retinal pigment epithilial cells to protect the neighborhood
8656143 biologically well intentioned though the sacrifice may be it can lead to blindness
8656144 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available
8656145 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8656146 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8656147 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
8656148 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
8656149 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes

8656162 clearly export prices matter as much as volumes when it comes to canadas balance of payments and commodities in particular have been keeping canada on track toward a decade of quarterly current account surpluses
8656163 whats interesting is the very strong numbers coming out of retail banking in canada up 19 percent that is a clear leader in the space
8656164 having seen all of the big six banks report i would say that the winner of the reporting season is royal
8656165 our retail businesses on both sides of the border which again produced more than 90 per cent of our earnings this quarter continued to perform very well providing td with a solid base of consistent earnings
8656166 in what continues to be a tough environment for banks were showing our strategy is working
8656167 weighing together likely slowdowns in export growth and consumer spending and the continued troubles in the banking and housing sectors forecasters expect gdp growth to slow to about 1 5 per cent in the third quarter and to near zero in the fourth

8656172 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8656173 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8656174 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8656175 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8656176 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8656180 we are extremely pleased with the increase in production this quarter and the progress we have made since may in developing the voigts lease our march 31 2008 reserve report included seven proved undeveloped pud locations on the voigts lease as highlighted above since our last reserve report we have drilled and are in the process of completing 55 new wells with zero dry holes within that project based on these results we plan to completely drill out the additional 15 locations on this lease before moving on to any of our other 30 plus leases which cover over 13 500 gross acres we anticipate the total capital cost to fully develop the voigts lease will approximate 2 0 million we also plan to continue to implement our strategy of prudent acquisitions and development as capital becomes available
8656181 the impact of gustav could now be assuaged by this intervention
8656182 the impact of gustav on the downstream sector could be felt more acutely at least in the short term as there is no u s government inventory that can be released
8656183 there is the u s labor day holiday on monday and the market will be shut theres a lot of nervousness
8656184 our sense is if the figure surprises it may be on the down side

8656192 we finally have a potential therapy for preventing vision loss from dry amd
8656193 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance
8656194 this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available
8656195 collectively these studies highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by sirna based therapies
8656196 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men
8656197 the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or lose of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight with an average body mass index of 38 they already were obese and become more insulin resistant
8656198 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8656199 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes
8656200 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
8656201 in our first study of diabetic men we found that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
8656202 whether obesity or insulin resistance is the major determinant of hh has to be addressed in future studies and the pathogenesis of hh needs to be defined
8656203 from this nationally representative telephone survey we estimate that more than 4 3 million u s adults are taking opioids regularly in any given week
8656204 the extent and characteristics of opioid use among u s adults reflected in this study reinforces the need to strike a rational balance between opioid misuse and effective control of chronic pain
8656205 in fighting climate change we must look beyond the emissions from our own operations and look closely into the products and services we use and the suppliers we work with i am very pleased that defra is one of the first organisations to participate in this really important pilot project
8656206 i am pleased that the fco through its collaboration with the carbon disclosure project is leading government in the area of gaining a better understanding of the impacts of its expenditure decisions on carbon emissions throughout the supply chain understanding the carbon emissions and policies of our suppliers will help to embed the sustainability agenda within our procurement decision making
8656207 gloucestershire county council is committed to both minimising our own carbon emissions and working with our partners to reduce emissions from the whole county we are pleased to be part if this pioneering initiative to understand the carbon impact of council purchasing we are working with 2 000 of our suppliers to help them understand the impacts of their products and services and so reduce our contribution to further climate change
8656208 the public sector has enormous power to shape new markets through its procurement practices and these organisations are showing the way in the development of a low carbon economy by joining this project the public sector has positioned itself at the cutting edge of this issue and will be learning with the private sector rather than from it

8656237 by knowing this minimum galaxy mass we can better understand how dark matter behaves which is essential to one day learning how our universe and life as we know it came to be
8656238 suppose you are an alien flying over earth and identifying urban areas from the concentration of lights in the night from the brightness of the lights you may surmise for example that more humans live in los angeles than in mumbai but this is not the case
8656239 what we have discovered is more extreme and akin to saying that all metro areas even those that are barely visible at night to the aliens have a population of about 10 million
8656240 we are excited because these galaxies are virtually invisible yet contain a tremendous amount of dark matter
8656241 this helps us better understand the particle that makes up dark matter and it teaches us something about how galaxies form in the universe

8656251 even if it is hypothetically accepted that the victim had lost her virginity earlier it did not and cannot in law give licence to any person to rape her

8656253 the school initially didnt tell us that she has fallen from the fifth floor we came to know about it later she was not someone who would commit suicide

8656255 she was competing with herself she may have been stressed due to studies she had scored less in two monday tests
8656256 she got 26 marks out of 40 in her english test and because of that she may have been depressed according to her classmates she was very studious and was always occupied with books
8656257 let the police probe the matter the school is shocked and sad
8656258 the case is still open and we are waiting for the postmortem report before the investigations are taken forward and we come to any conclusion

8656273 delegate the things that other people can do better than me
8656274 we dont have layers and layers of management by design
8656275 i dont think a player should be able to play for two clubs in the same competition in the same season and i think we need to get the uefa strategic committee to look at the whole idea
8656276 i think that it is wrong that a player can play for two clubs in any competition scoring a goal for one team one week and then scoring against them a few weeks later
8656277 i also think we have to look at both the summer and winter transfer windows the season starts in many countries in july or early in august yet the transfer window does not close till the end of august
8656278 then we have another window in the middle of the season i think we need to look at the way the system works
8656279 we cannot force a young player to sign for his first club after that age
8656280 what i know is that negotiations are ongoing and that is about it we have agreed a fee but nothing has been signed yet
8656281 he is going to be a big loss for this club he has been fantastic here at mk and it is a bit of a shame but it is the players wish and dream and we wish him good luck
8656282 he has done well but not only him i think the whole team did extraordinarily well last season football is a team sport not an individual sport and i guess well survive without andrews
8656283 it is going to take time to see how much hell be missed here and obviously you know the transfer window closes in a few days so there is not much time left
8656284 but i guess the chairman will be happy he has got a richer bank account and we will see what we can do

8656313 shame on you barack obama i am a pow version of him talking at the camera since i am not near a tv i cannot tell if people are buying this but i a sure the msm is already trampling all over themselves over it
8656314 you are a wonderful speaker senator obama but speeches dont solve our problems do you understand that
8656315 we implore you to totally ignore any mail that claims you have won money in a lottery when in fact you never purchased a ticket for that particular lotto draw
8656316 the confident tricksters have gone to the extent of affiliating themselves illegally to legitimate international lotteries hoping that it will give them more credibility
8656317 these criminals target people outside johannesburg so that when the victim is asked to fly through to or tambo they instead opt for the money to be deposited into their bank account and the only way they can do that is by giving the scam operators their banking details
8656318 the way people reacted when we walked off the field and they booed thats more than enough motivation for the guys to put in a big performance
8656319 weve got to make sure we learn from our mistakes and move forward
8656320 jacques was obvious hes done it before hes our most experienced player
8656321 my biggest stand was people getting involved in selection who shouldnt have been
8656322 thats now been sorted out the presidents veto doesnt exist any more
8656323 so i just had to sit down and make sure i had my mind right and it is something im really proud to do
8656324 graeme had a cortisone injection this morning he probably shouldnt have played from the end of the edgbaston test
8656325 but testimony to the captain we have he got himself out there took injections and worked through a lot of anti inflammatories
8656326 we were trying to pull up a bit of a buffer early on in the one day series and then thought we could leave him out towards the back end
8656327 but its just got too bad he pretty much cant grip a bat with his top hand now so its best for us to get him home rehab and get him ready for what is a huge summer for us
8656328 weve got some work to do were by no means out of this series we can still come back and win this 3 2 but were going to have to play really well
8656329 i think england are a very good one day side

8656332 eu me encarrego de tudo do que valentino n o gosta
8656333 a jury was able to see that and come to the correct verdict
8656334 we thought there was certainly enough evidence to convict this person of this crime the jury chose to ignore it
8656335 im not saying its a conspiracy but you know what it certainly gives pause and gives a motive
8656336 gorki aguila has not committed any specific crime as defined by the current criminal code
8656337 these kinds of trials are very biased its difficult for someone to be absolved
8656338 a lawyer can do very little because theres no evidence of criminal activity presented only what the police say
8656339 weve finished our new album we dont know if this is because of that or if it could be something thats been cooking for months
8656340 however the department of foreign affairs dfa wishes to call it it still is the same banana insane absurd useless and burdensome
8656341 this proves how clueless and off the mark government is about what needs to be done the dfa refuses to go to the bottom of this issue
8656342 investigate and crucify these embassy officials who would rather take the easy way out have our ofws admit to being insane rather than seek for justice and truth
8656343 the dfa opted to tone their proposal down from psychiatric to psychological in hopes of dousing cold water to the widespread protest generated by the ofws
8656344 hey im not working full time now i can take a class something fun something i can use to take a step toward my art goals and build a better future
8656345 exaggerated reactions tend to happen when you have thin trading
8656346 we must not tear families apart with such cold calculated indifference
8656347 theyre realizing that the risks are there and theyll realize that the benefits outweigh the risks and theyll come begging for it

8656353 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8656354 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas
8656355 but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8656356 we like to provide as many services as possible for free
8656357 people like samantha ronson dont need to be around lindsay who was samantha ronson before lindsay lohan she was nobody
8656358 she is using her for her own gain all these people have inserted themselves into her life like parasites and its not right
8656359 has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me
8656360 im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8656361 i am always will and always have been here for her for her not for anything else so i think its safe to say that there is not now and never will be a tell all written by me when does your book come out mr lohan
8656362 talking through the language of the bullet should be stopped
8656363 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page if anyone has any questions id be happy to answer them as best i can if anyone has any comments im glad to listen
8656364 i have a fairly specific idea of what the first 15 pages of the screenplay will be and no idea what will happen on pages 16 through 130 i have very strong feelings about the internet and its effect on our national culture but frankly those feelings are being countered by the sophistication kindness curiosity and wit of the posts in this site
8656365 matt and andy have had their eye on setting up a pub for ages when the property came on the market they had to have it
8656366 its perfect matt puts in most of the money and andy can dj there and manage it when matt is off touring all the lads can relax there and bring their mates

8656371 you dont wait around in a hot rental market like this as ghoulish as it sounds people will rent that place in a heartbeat
8656372 it the criticism just doesnt make sense to me either the moment i read the screenplay i knew it was an important story and as its a true tale of heroic resistance to one of the great villains of history i cant imagine that people wont want to see it
8656373 im having to do things differently as i get older i used to be able to tour for 16 months at a time but theres no way i could do that now i split it up into shifts these days
8656374 people ask me why syd withdrew and i think it was a combination of too much lsd and a very eccentric creative brain
8656375 if youre very tired and put a load of acid into the mix youve got chaos havent you it was all very nasty but it was inevitable when you put those three factors together you are going to have an explosion arent you

8656383 our children are our most precious gift on this planet
8656384 to have that innocence ripped away from a child is unacceptable every child should be allowed to be a child
8656385 is a little bit of relief shasta will have some closure and justice will be done for her family when he receives the death penalty
8656386 ms martinez deserves that closure just as much as any other mother until there is closure for those families for me its not over yet

8656396 long past time that we all shut up stop making public statements and we get on with the job we are meant to do
8656397 we have been petrified and worried and absolutely out of our wits worrying about our own family
8656398 but as for the corbys our hearts really go out to them
8656399 tim was a friend of micks for over 30 years he was a renowned figure in the racing scene who was universally popular in the industry

8656403 by all rights we should be having a fierce debate over the role of government what should it do for whom and why what can we afford who should pay these questions would suggest a campaign that seriously engages the future but instead we have a bidding war between candidates to see who can promise the most appealing package of new spending programs and tax cuts as we watch the conventions we should recognize that weve entered an era of fantasy politics like fantasy football and baseball fantasy politics is an exercise in make believe that is intended to keep its players occupied and to make the winners feel good senators obama and mccain emit pleasing slogans and programs that as often as not are disconnected from the countrys actual problems theyll encounter in office

8656413 she is doing everything she can to move away from how she is perceived in london the truth is that max offered her a way out of it all she was offered stability and a move away from the negative press she was receiving in the uk now peaches is planning a move to new york and is starting over with a place at nyu and a new job at nylon magazine
8656414 she wasnt too sure about new york at first but her father persuaded her and so she signed up at the university and was offered a job

8656418 i am honestly not thinking about the other girls at all because i am always just jumping against myself i have moved on and put the bitterness of beijing behind me but what happened there will make me more eager to win my next competitions

8656426 theres a specific law the family entertainment and copyright act that deals specifically with pre release material the rationale being that leaking this material prevents the owner of the copyright from getting the first release
8656427 the first release is always the one thats going to get the most profit for the person who owns the copyright to take that first opportunity from someone is more serious and is usually pursued criminally to try to prevent that from happening again
8656428 in my opinion and im assuming its his first offense
8656429 i wouldnt expect significant jail time but i would expect a fine and some jail time its a felony not a misdemeanor and the federal courts have guidelines depending on how much profit was made the seriousness of the crime and whether the person cooperated
8656430 he may end up getting probation i would be shocked if he got anywhere near three years in prison
8656431 the band is in the position now where they can start a civil action and they would be successful
8656432 but how are their fans feeling about this theyll have their own public relations issues as to whether theyre going to start an action here
8656433 i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for

8656435 under the police services act eventually the unclaimed property will be auctioned theres certain requirements within the statute that have to be followed and time periods to be met and then they are disposed of by auction
8656436 were probably a day or two away from being very confident about where it will land
8656437 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8656438 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics
8656439 i think its long past time that we all shut up stop making public statements about private disputes and get on with the job that we are paid to do

8656452 research shows the network supports some of the last strongholds of australias most threatened native animals and plants on public land and it provides some of the last connections of nature in our extensively cleared and modified landscapes thus facilitating the movement of animals and plants across the landscape
8656453 its only by keeping the network as a complete network in public hands that we can manage the connectivity it provides across the landscape as species try to move in response to climate change
8656454 it was worth taking the time to go through the pilot process to really do it right

8656623 in some cases operators are charging you for a call of one minute two seconds what they can charge you for two minutes this leads to overcharging on average of 24 percent for calls made and 19 percent for calls received

8656656 obama showed a rude unbalanced side that had previously been hidden a side of his persona that seriously calls into question whether he has the temperament necessary to have his finger on the nuclear button
8656657 the truth is all he did was do anything it took to survive that doesnt make him a hero and it doesnt make him honorable its just makes him not suicidal
8656658 before you unthinkingly start giving mccain too much credit for all his self declared heroism
8656659 in my book anyone who serves this country is a person who has heroism and honour
8656660 denounce this administrations policies on torture and then question whether mccain was tortured
8656661 honor is what no man can give you and none can take away

8656666 so you think helping make the propoganda films that so many other pows utterly refused to participate in makes mccain more honorable personally id have to say less

8656717 voor deze uitzending vroegen we een aantal jonge vrouwen hun ideale man te beschrijven
8656718 wat daar bij opviel is dat ze eisen dat mannen absoluut geen haar hebben vrouwen vinden het blijkbaar veel hygi nischer als hij zijn geslachtsdelen scheert
8656719 het is niet nieuw dat vrouwen voor geld en macht vallen mannen met status en macht hebben een sterker gen en dat is goed voor het nageslacht maar ook kunstenaars hebben een speciale aantrekkingskracht op vrouwen een wetenschapper vergelijkt in de uitzending een kunstenaar met een pauw zijn staart is niet levensnoodzakelijk en eigenlijk een heel onhandig ding maar voor een pauw is het wel een lokmiddel om de vrouwtjes te laten zien hoe sterk zijn genenpakket is kunst is blijkbaar ook als het tentoonstellen van je genenpakket en dat wekt reacties los bij dezelfde hersendelen als een grote penis een brede kaaklijn en testosteron dat doen dat blijkt althans uit onderzoek

8656737 students who are coming out of kelley are almost certainly going to be in supervisory capacities shortly after entering an organization if you have people who already know how to coach others give positive and negative feedback to their subordinates and help all of the people in their department maximize their skills that immediately adds value to an organization
8656738 theyll see the results of their own abilities to guide and motivate and understand what people need its not just learning its doing
8656739 other programs focus on you as an individual and your own leadership development rather than what you can do to develop others
8656740 these 30 students have already excelled they are leaders at kelley iu and in extracurricular activities but how do you make the people around you leaders as well thats what other programs dont do
8656741 many people can achieve a lot for themselves but to be able to externalize that and help other people succeed is a critical leadership skill
8656742 one of altrias core strategic focus areas is the development and recruitment of leaders we hope to attract develop and retain diverse employees at all levels our support for this program directly falls in line with our recruitment goals and our efforts to attract future leaders
8656743 by the end of the year well have a solid package of information about what works in this environment to help students accomplish leadership goals
8656744 there will be accountability were going to be keeping an eye on the process to make sure everyones getting what he or she really needs throughout the year
8656745 i want to share my experiences and help other students take advantage and succeed in this program

8656831 the combination of a technically eye popping opening ceremony and impressive execution of the olympic games demonstrates the lengths to which china went to ensure the world saw the best it had to offer and paid china its due respect
8656832 china won more gold medals than any other country and its leadership sought such an outcome to be the worlds focus for two weeks not darfur tibet or democracy this was a coming out party of unprecedented size and scope
8656833 inflation is a threat the country is rapidly aging the divide between urban and rural quality of life is vast corruption is widespread global energy resources to fuel its rapid industrialization are limited and there are horrendous environmental problems the political system limits the free flow of information lacks the self correcting mechanisms of democracy and stifles creativity so the governments mission is to preserve stability amid formidable challenges this task has been particularly burdensome in 2008 an uprising and vicious crackdown in tibet in march inspired protests around the world the may earthquake in sichuan killed more than 50 000 and international outrage over beijings ties to the sudanese government continues
8656834 for now my impression is that china is focused on economic growth social stability and national unity not outward aggression at the end of the day on north korea energy security the global economy and even iran we agree with china it is startling to see chinas capacity to allay or aggravate our concerns regarding the economy energy the environment and foreign policy
8656835 treating beijing as a threat only will guarantee that it becomes one we should seek an enduring relationship that facilitates chinas further integration into the community of nations while constructively engaging china on issues like tibet taiwan darfur the rule of law and the freeing of political prisoners

8657108 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8657109 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8657110 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8657111 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8657112 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
8657113 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8657114 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
8657115 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8657116 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways
8657117 humans and other large mammals primates and large carnivores like tigers for example exist in cluttered environments like forests or jungles and their eyes have evolved to point in the same direction

8657139 our outlook for sales and revenues this year still reflects another record year of growth in sales and revenues to caterpillar and for that matter for earnings
8657140 what is particularly impressive is that we have been able to sustain growth and strong earnings in the face of very severe recessionary conditions in our domestic market in the united states
8657141 while there has been some positive change in the fact that sales declines narrowed in july compared to other months this year the economy continues to keep some buyers out of the market
8657142 political conservatives have long believed that the best government is a small government but if this were true noted economist jeff madrick argues the nation would not be experiencing stagnant wages rising health care costs increasing unemployment and concentrations of wealth for a narrow elite

8657418 i took off cesc early last night because it was his first game back but it was just precautionary at ajax in pre season he stayed on too long and got injured two or three days later of course you cannot plan to take a player off before a game of that importance but if you can rest them then you will do it
8657419 global warming has now got to the stage where it is only maintained by media self censorship if the general public ever got to know of the scandals surrounding the collection and processing of data or that there has been no detectable warming for the last decade the whole movement would be dead in the water but they dont so it isnt it has become the most powerful myth in human history sending much of the world into a downward helix of economic decline it is a tenuous hypothesis supported by ill found computer models and data from botched measurement dubiously processed
8657420 its extremely difficult to know how the consumer will respond in the back half of the year
8657421 while our history would say that trends would improve what we are seeing today does not support that premise

8657424 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8657425 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8657426 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues but he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8657427 hillary clinton won blue collar voters through a heavy dose of economic populism combined with intense retail politicking through diners and small towns clinton transformed herself into a heroine of the working class winning most of the later primaries
8657428 a fifth of clinton voters plan to vote for mccain and another 10 percent may stay home
8657429 mccain tying obama in virginia and colorado gaining an edge in ohio florida new mexico and nevada and establishing a strong foothold in missouri
8657430 many swing state delegates think the obama campaign has got to start pounding on the economy emphasizing the sharp contrast between the candidates on the issue that has voters most upset
8657431 with people who have a lot of gifts its hard for people to identify with them rendell said
8657432 rendell told her that obama needs to hammer home his economic message because voters are
8657433 but it is not enough to declare mr bushs terms a disaster mr obamas task is to make the case unequivocally that his ideas and his partys ideas are the best way to recover from that disaster
8657434 the jobs picture in san bernardino riverside county right now is not particularly good people want to know when are things going to bottom will we have a v or u in terms of the recovery
8657435 prices have come down so fast and rents have gone up enough that house prices in this region are sensible
8657436 the inland empire lags southern california it lags the state of california it lags the united states as a whole
8657437 have pushed class a office vacancy to its highest level in more than two decades
8657438 fuel costs are definitely having a major impact on the industrial business in the inland empire
8657439 we also have a lot of industrial manufacturing engineering related to the manufacturing process medical manufacturing
8657440 the office sector along the i 10 corridor thats the future in our opinion

8657445 remember what is unbecoming to do is also unbecoming to speak of
8657446 as scientists were excited about this discovery because its a fundamentally new approach to regulating what enzymes do in cells
8657447 the fact that it also offers a potentially novel use of a drug already widely in use for other applications is an unexpected bonus

8657451 boys and girls in america have such a bad time together
8657452 its the most battered sector if the u s economy is doing better than expected then people might assume that the financial crisis is not as bad as thought
8657453 im extremely doubtful that the credit crisis is over but these are very low levels for the banks they are good trading stocks at the lower levels
8657454 we admit that retail was satisfactory and this could reassure somewhat
8657455 rumours of the death of the australian economy are overdone
8657456 certainly there are economies around the globe skirting recession territory yet the outlook for the domestic economy remains robust
8657457 this data shows that many businesses are still confidently investing in future capacity despite the global economic downturn and 12 straight rate rises pushing up business costs
8657458 i would ask this question why is it that when there is positive economic data out there those opposite find no reason to embrace that in their argument at all
8657459 the abs conducted this survey in july and august and if ever you were going to see a downgrade from collapsing confidence youd have thought it would be now
8657460 to see a bigger than average upgrade tells you how robust the story is now
8657461 manufacturing is the weaker component but to see any sort of positive increase is a good result given higher interest rates weaker consumer spending and the strong dollar
8657462 the mining companies in western australia will be buying copper pipes for plumbing from manufacturers in victoria
8657463 this will be good for employment investment is one of the channels for the terms of trade benefits to be distributed throughout the economy and these numbers show it is working pretty well
8657464 it is possible that investment might remain surprisingly resilient given that much of it is concentrated in the resources sector which is still performing strongly and this will provide continued support for growth
8657465 indeed these data provide no support for the notion that firms will savagely slash their capital spending expectations
8657466 while the directors believe it is probable that the mill project will proceed to completion the financing structure is yet to be finalised
8657467 and gunns cannot state with certainty that such a structure will be achievable nor can it provide an assurance that the mill project will proceed
8657468 discussions with potential debt providers are at various stages certain debt providers have indicated agreement in principle to facility terms with other debt providers discussions are ongoing
8657469 in addition gunns is continuing its discussions with a number of potential equity parties including industry participants who have expressed interest in making a direct equity investment in the mill project
8657470 it is gunns current intention that a joint venture equity partner will be invited to take up to a 50 per cent interest in the mill project however whether this eventuates will depend on the outcome of negotiations
8657471 the process with potential equity parties will take a period of time to work through and gunns does not expect the financing plan to be finalised before the first quarter of 2009 with principal construction activities unlikely to commence before then
8657472 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard is gone
8657473 so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve
8657474 mostly costello kept his disappointment in check refraining from the odd bitter comment would have been heroic virtue in a saint let alone an ambitious politician
8657475 he never challenged because he didnt want to wreck the government in order to lead it
8657476 we are going to celebrate the public life and recognise it so far of peter costello
8657477 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama

8657480 i am honoured to be here tonight to support barack obama
8657481 primarily driven by the impact of economic and regulatory conditions in the groups two largest regions australia and north america
8657482 not expected to improve over the balance of the year
8657483 this outcome which represents the equivalent of approximately 9c per issued share has no impact on the groups operational and strategic objectives or its financial strength or capital management policy
8657484 on an investment portfolio of 100 billion they are quite immaterial
8657485 if you have a look at the monoline wraps they are invested in australia and nz credit
8657486 in difficult market conditions like this we have a clear bias towards holding more capital rather than less
8657487 we have no plans for a buyback in this environment

8657496 the average wage in 2006 was 46 996 down 101 or a fraction of 1 percent from 47 097 in 2000
8657497 i think the reason for it the union criticism is that those individuals from one or two unions are locked into a view of equity which doesnt work
8657498 but i think weve got to put ancient debates behind us which are purely about throwing resources at one end of the system without measuring the results at the other end of the system
8657499 we are concerned that there is a group of communities a group of young australians who are in a grave grave danger of being left behind
8657500 plainly you are going to have some people in the unions who are going to go for us big time that is a matter for them
8657501 all we are seeking from the government is the evidence from experience in the us and the uk these are flawed models
8657502 ultimately in order to achieve the outcomes we want we need to ensure that our schools are properly funded
8657503 i dont support narrow league tables as they all too often distort both student progress and teacher achievement
8657504 but i dont think that is why the government is suggesting them either
8657505 we want to open up the convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party
8657506 the question for obama is what have you done and what have you run
8657507 he has good oratory but when you shut off the teleprompter theres not much there
8657508 barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8657509 hes going to lay out a case for change hes going to set the stakes of this election the risks of continuing down the road were on which is plainly what senator mccain is offering
8657510 have sought creditor protection by filing legal notices of intention to appoint an administrator in both the u k and canada
8657511 the airlines flights will continue to operate and the decision to instigate creditor protection proceedings means that the demands of existing creditors are frozen while we continue negotiations on an investment package which already are at an advanced stage

8657518 champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8657519 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time
8657520 john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8657521 let us declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8657522 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8657523 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8657524 and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8657525 to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the effort to take america back
8657526 rose highlighted the companys strong performance in north america where there had been concerns that a slowdown in consumer spending would impact heavily on the companys lucrative spirits business
8657527 from all across this continent cultures indigenous to this land have experienced a continuous uprooting and dislocating of our people
8657528 well if you look around and you see the construction and whats happening around the state you see that the fires still burn the progressive act of building something this challenging in todays world is proof that our cultures do endure
8657529 im getting people on all sides telling me how unbalanced the questions are

8657532 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his job depends on not understanding it
8657533 eric is a tremendous friend incredibly bright young man he has wonderful credentials and i think would be a very good complementary candidate to john mccain

8657543 the different strokes give swimmers multiple opportunities to win medals
8657544 the growth data are even better than many expected and again counter beliefs the economy was in recession in the first half of the year
8657545 t he momentum going into the third quarter is clearly greater and could result in a significant upward revision to 2008 real growth estimates
8657546 w e think it is too soon to turn optimistic as the economy faces important challenges in the months ahead most important weak consumer fundamentals will likely begin to assert themselves in the second half of the year as the stimulus from the income tax rebates begins to fade
8657547 the income side of the economy has expanded by only 0 3 over the last year in real terms while expenditure based real gdp is up 2 2 moreover the income estimate of gdp fell in both the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year looking much more like a classic recession that we think began in december 2007
8657548 of course not ive worked my entire life ive got nothing in common with the man

8657551 hes a bafflingly popular cnn sports anchor he is i believe portuguese and demonstrates this by saying the names of spanish and portuguese players in an exaggerated iberian accent when presenting on cnn he has never been known to have a hair out of place

8657559 it was great to see a teams fans really enjoy their moment and the chance to see barcelona bayern or whoever i remember i think when europe was special to me as an arsenal fan when these games were unique and unusual now they are humdrum and routine except the odd san siro trip just hope i can get tickets for basel v big guns
8657560 did you know that robert pires in his last and slightly knackered season at arsenal managed to score more league goals than hleb did in his entire arsenal career
8657561 not that im bitter expect arsenal to get one dutch side they should cruise past but dont
8657562 after yesterdays debacle the likes of anorthosis cfr cluj and borisov must be hoping and praying they get the golden ticket

8657576 t he big publishers cultivate and manage premeditated blockbusters based on plot progressions and positioning
8657577 you can read each story by itself but if you read both
8657578 the big publishers tend not to wake up and realize they have hits in their midst based on folks reaction to a creative approach
8657579 weve done britneys sets and a whole bunch of rock shows but this was far more elaborate and complicated and we had to do it in far less time
8657580 the biggest challenge has been making sure we dont damage the playing field underneath
8657581 with the convention hammering obamas lack of experience and judgment
8657582 he said people were not treating him very well he said they dont like arabs
8657583 i told him just be cool this is only for three months and then you will come back to your country you must study
8657584 there is a very bad situation now not only for qataris but for all arabs
8657585 for the majority of good people who live in hastings that is far from their minds
8657586 but we do have a significant minority of individuals who are racist and they are encouraged by extremist groups that seek to play a part in stirring up unrest
8657587 an event like this apart from being a dreadful tragedy for mohammed and his family is not good for hastings

8657590 gustav has either reformed to the south or been moving more to the south south west overnight the reformation of the center has caused a big southward change in the early part of the forecast
8657591 this should allow gustav to turn more to the west and then northwest around the time it enters the gulf of mexico
8657592 a mid latitude high is forecast to be in the ohio valley in about five days which may continue steering the storm northwest rather than allow a more northward motion

8657604 often movies have to reshoot scenes when the powers that be are less than satisfied with the original footage but peter facinelli who plays vampire patriarch carlisle cullen put a positive spin on the work theyll be doing
8657605 the picture has a graphic novel visual element similar to the movies sin city and 300
8657606 the show is a sort of mash up of buffy the vampire slayer and the x files all wrapped up in a classic road movie and following this format so expertly forged by whedon and carter the shows writers are given the freedom to craft some brilliant standalone episodes whilst also building a satisfying season long narrative
8657607 i cant guarantee itll be great literature but anything featuring sam and dean is worth checking out

8657623 iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki has no interest in integrating these guys none
8657624 he thinks they re thugs he thinks they re hooligans in fact there s some evidence that he s trying to pick fights with them hoping that they will start a fight that he can then turn around and finish them
8657625 without more pressure from the highest levels of the u s government
8657626 the sons of iraq will rightly conclude that theyre not going to get a place at the table and go back to doing what they were doing before
8657627 rather than trying to join the political process they will try to undermine it with violence as part of the insurgency
8657628 oh sure we ll let that colonel in the republican guard into the iraqi police but we ll make him an enlisted beat cop
8657629 do you know how low on the social scale that is in iraq and how humiliating this is
8657630 you don t have to believe that 100 000 of these guys are going to turn back into insurgents

8657648 la scuola ha detto il ministro deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali
8657649 abbiamo pensato a un periodo di tre quattro o cinque anni entro il quale i libri non possono essere cambiati i contenuti di alcune materie fondamentali come italiano o matematica non cambiano da un anno allaltro

8657652 weve done everything we entered victoria crater to do and more
8657653 our experience tells us theres lots of diversity among the cobbles
8657654 we want to get a better characterization of them a statistical sampling from examining more of them will be important for understanding the geology of the area
8657655 the patterns broadly resemble what we saw at the smaller craters opportunity explored earlier
8657656 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time
8657657 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
8657658 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem
8657659 both rovers show signs of aging but they are both still capable of exciting exploration and scientific discovery
8657660 no im sorry sweetie but its time to turn the television off and play outside for awhile
8657661 god remember count chocula i used to live on that stuff
8657662 oh yeah but what ever happened to boo berry the one with the ghost on the cover and the blue marshmallows i havent seen it since i was a kid
8657663 oh we would never let dakota ryder eat sugary cereal were a sugar free household dakota ryder banjo only eats all bran no trace of anything that tastes remotely edible flakes from whole foods its only eighty five dollars a box

8657665 i actually love cleaning i clean everyday anyway so when a party comes up im already halfway there
8657666 i normally wouldnt send this kind of email but this ones really funny you guys
8657667 i realize its chances are very remote but even if we do not pass a bill this lays the groundwork for us to pass major energy legislation after the first of the year
8657668 these bills would be a step in the right direction
8657669 i dont think theyre enough but we need to look at everything
8657670 i think drilling should be a part of it but not everything
8657671 im not willing to let oil companies be the engine that drives our energy policy weve got to start looking at all the alternatives and i dont think we ought to keep giving the oil companies tax breaks
8657672 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8657673 i was truly fortunate to play as long as i did
8657674 a great opportunity to become an assistant coach was presented to me by the stars and i look forward to making that transition and learning a new part of the game
8657675 its really only just a safety measure just something to have on hand in case god forbid youd ever need it
8657676 if a child is lost in the park we need parents to be able to give that information to the police
8657677 its something that would be able to assist law enforcement in case theres an incident in the future
8657678 by having certain tools at your side like fingerprints or dental records it can assist to properly identify a child

8657690 i think its unfortunate that so many in the national media think that you can only win elections by appealing to fear
8657691 i think thats clearly what the mccain campaign is doing and theres a vigorous debate about whether or not you stoop to their level or you stay above it and stay focused

8657699 we copped equine influenza in the first half a few changes to the way you can run gaming machines in this state victoria but then all of a sudden lotteries kick in with a marvellous run
8657700 our businesses have all got nice momentum as we move into the new financial year
8657701 were expecting this half to be very solid the way things are panning out for us theres nothing on our horizon that gives us any real cause for concern
8657702 if you have a look at the numbers overall they show that the domestic economy remains pretty robust
8657703 its down to the fact that the mining boom is having a significant impact but its not just mining you are seeing it across other areas as well with transportation and construction remaining quite strong
8657704 the important factor is that there are other economies around the world that are noticing a pretty significant slowdown but were in a much more enviable position
8657705 it is reassuring for the reserve bank that the death of the australian economy is not at our doors yet
8657706 this sort of gives them some light at the end of the tunnel
8657707 weve seen weakness in consumer sentiment weve seen weaker business sentiment numbers but really it hasnt translated into a weaker investment number yet
8657708 really the supply side of the economy is pretty well primed to grow quite rapidly and absorb the inflationary pressures so wages will remain in check
8657709 it gives the reserve bank the option of making that rate cut come next week
8657710 i think theyve compounded the problem and i think thats why wayne swan really has been the worst treasurer in australias history
8657711 in tough times people wont go and buy a new refrigerator they may not buy a new car or take a trip to paris but they will allow themselves little indulgences
8657712 history has shown they want to get away from their worries and escape to the movies and theme parks they buy dvds and it is all good for us
8657713 we said a year or two back we were going to shift the emphasis of the company to a greater one for theme parks aquariums and water parks
8657714 weve done that and we are looking at other opportunities i hate to take advantage of other peoples misfortunes but if we cant do good deals we wont do any deals
8657715 gunns is working towards a financing structure which will not require additional equity to be raised by gunns shareholders
8657716 the process with potential equity parties will take a period of time to work through and gunns does not expect the financing plan to be finalised before the first quarter of 2009
8657717 the financing structure is yet to be finalised and gunns cannot say with any certainty that such a structure will be achievable nor can it provide an assurance that the mill project proceed
8657718 awb has said it needs these changes in order to move forward and be able to offer a competitive price to australian wheat growers
8657719 we are committed to the coal seam gas monetisation project
8657720 the outcome of that process will be a major determinant of the shape of origin going forward
8657721 if bg lifts its bid further thats when it becomes difficult to decide on the more attractive option the takeover or an alternative path of going with a global partner
8657722 i would say there is still a good chance that bg will lift its bid although the likelihood is lower now than it was a few weeks ago before qgcs offer for sunshine
8657723 this class action was the only recourse for the shareholders and without it they wouldnt have got a cent
8657724 i think the regulator does a pretty good job in australia
8657725 but like all regulators theyre under resourced and they cant possibly prosecute every case so there is a role for both
8657726 the first half of 2008 has been particularly challenging with replacement demand in our key markets running at historic lows
8657727 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8657728 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8657743 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8657744 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8657745 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8657746 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8657747 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8657748 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8657749 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8657750 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8657751 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms

8657764 we initially thought a greater number of vehicles would be sold
8657765 the economic environment the crude oil price and the raw material cost trends were not accurately forecast
8657766 we consider electric vehicles as one of the candidates for sustainable mobility but for the time being the most realistic approach is to use the electric vehicle for short distance travel

8657770 the toads have made it to darwin where they are doing well they have had trouble establishing in sydney despite lots of toads finding their way there but our predictions make us feel quite safe from toads in melbourne
8657771 we considered the ability of adult toads to move around on the surface and the potential for the toad tadpoles to develop successfully
8657772 it simply becomes too cold for them to move around
8657773 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
8657774 although permanent water sources like those in the beautiful west macdonnell ranges and the pilbara are of concern
8657775 the toads are also likely to be limited by dehydration as they move inland
8657776 they are mutually claiming the other side started it at the moment its very difficult to confirm who has started it
8657777 we explained that we want dialogue to end this fight
8657778 its not true that were breaking the ceasefire theyre trying to lie because they want war when theyre fighting us how can we disarm
8657779 our goal in this thing is to create the brand
8657780 i wont say its a slam dunk that were going to be a success
8657781 yeah i cant believe people are still paying us to play concerts
8657782 the fact that john mccain made a great sacrifice in the service of his country but i dont see how mccains experience as a pow despite his campaigns exploitation of it makes him necessarily more qualified to handle national security and foreign policy than barack obama
8657783 if you dont mind me saying the only thing john mccains pow experience says about him is that he knows how to suck dick
8657784 badges and a handgun are out there and that is a big concern

8657787 he is a yale educated intellectual who is also a rock and roll musician and an actor of great wit intuition and sensuality so all the seemingly contradictory sides of jans personality can come into play besides hes a san franciscan so hes an anarchist and utopian at heart
8657788 i couldnt ask for a better opportunity to be able to play this role in rock n roll a guy very much like myself whose love of vinyl leads him belatedly to political activism
8657789 even when its not overtly political rock music is by its nature primal visceral irrational and rebellious a mere act of playing a record can be a way of speaking truth to power that even to this day remains inherently dangerous to authoritarian regimes

8657810 on a positive note 66 percent of all vulnerabilities identified have been remediated underscoring the value of a consistent web site vulnerability management program
8657811 it should be noted however that the frequency with which security issues are reported does not reflect the frequency of their distribution in the wild
8657812 for example cross site scripting comprised roughly 23 percent of the total application vulnerability volume yet this vulnerability is very common in proprietary web applications

8657826 if i live 1 000 years i will never understand that accounting rule its dishonest
8657827 why have increased penalties for attacks on pregnant women if the not yet born baby doesnt matter
8657828 either that child matters so that attacks on pregnant women are more heinous in which case bill c 484 is a direct recognition of that reality or that child doesnt matter in which case we dont need any new law the saddest thing of all is that the government bill likely adds nothing that doesnt already exist in law
8657829 as members of parliament we continue to support the passage of the unborn victims of crime act a private members bill sponsored by ken epp mp for edmonton sherwood park
8657830 the unborn victims of crime act c 484 is an important piece of legislation one that will create a separate offence under the criminal code to injure or kill an unborn child when the mother is assaulted
8657831 at the present time the criminal code of canada does not provide for any charges to be laid in respect of the unborn child who is injured or dies as a result according to mp epp
8657832 we the undersigned will continue to use all the legislative avenues at our disposal to ensure the successful passage of the unborn victims of crime act into law we look forward to supporting mr epps bill at third reading

8657834 just trying to take it all in and remember every experience ive had
8657835 a little r amp r here and there but i think over the next month and a half ill be able to settle down a little bit more and hopefully get settled in my new place and have some downtime
8657836 for the next few months just taking some time off actually i havent exercised at all since my last day of competition over a week ago but i think i need to start doing something im getting kind of antsy just sitting around
8657837 in beijing i had to really focus on one event at a time and once that event was done i had to put it behind me thats just sort of where my mind frame was during the meet and once it was over i dont think everything has really set in but i think over the next few months and years i think it really will set in and im proud of everything that ive done and im happy i had this opportunity
8657838 all had sort of like a group huddle and we were talking a little bit about you know sort of the real definition of teamwork and what it means to each and every one of us were all just thankful to have he team we had and that we were able to be successful
8657839 the medals are a little crooked but its a cool shot when i first was taking it i had never had them all on at once and i never realized how heavy it was but it was a fun picture and im glad i was able to take it like that it looks pretty cool i think
8657840 we wanted to create a news aggregating site where its just as simple as clicking on the logos of your favorite web sites its for mainstream news readers not early adopters or techies
8657841 pilot mark believes the myth that the plane will be held in place
8657842 a plane is standing on a runway that can move some sort of band conveyor the plane moves in one direction while the conveyor moves in the opposite direction this conveyor has a control system that tracks the plane speed and tunes the speed of the conveyor to be exactly the same but in the opposite direction can the plane take off

8657844 there have been a lot of changes in the last 18 months
8657845 we are restructuring the whole company we are refocusing our whole business and were planning that we have a clean start in 2009
8657846 were going to stay quiet on that its a political decision
8657847 the opinion expressed by newspapers and the business papers here is there is no practical value for such a law
8657848 slack economic conditions throughout the world as well as surges in the prices of natural resources and raw materials
8657849 arsenic poisoning is behind many instances of ill health in southern asia including a rising number of cancer cases developing a low cost method of decontaminating ground water that is laced with high levels of arsenic is a key challenge for sustainable agriculture there
8657850 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
8657851 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8657852 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers
8657853 with their help we now have a solution which is transferable to many areas in need across asia
8657854 currently food heated in a microwave loses heat to the cold dish because the dishes are transparent to microwaves
8657855 the plates are still cool when the cooking is completed
8657856 dishes heated by themselves or with food could keep the food hot of up to 15 minutes one might even cook a pizza on a plate and then deliver it hot
8657857 we used cooking oil because it is an innocuous substance
8657858 we could perhaps use this material in a closed system to decompose organic contaminants in soil or dirt
8657859 the association between magnesium sulfate and a lower incidence of cerebral palsy has biologic plausibility because magnesium stabilizes blood vessels protects against damage from oxygen depletion and protects against injury from swelling and inflammation all of which threaten the vulnerable preterm brain
8657860 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to evaluate the effect of magnesium sulfate on the incidence of cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8657861 our finding that magnesium sulfate protects against cerebral palsy is consistent with two previous randomized trials both of which were well done and which in total enrolled over 1 600 women our trial and the two others show that magnesium sulfate can reduce the risk of this devastating condition in preterm infants until we can prevent early preterm birth the best that we obstetricians can do is to improve the prospects for infants who are born very early i think that our study says that magnesium sulfate can help us do that
8657862 it is kind of the issue of the snake swallowing the watermelon

8657866 i think there are times when the camels system is more informative and times when market price more informative
8657867 you can look at this and say they are missing the problems but this business cycle is different from others
8657868 you need to go through this to be able to update the model it is really a catch 22
8657869 improving crystal quality and purity leads to explosive materials that are safer less likely to react violently when subjected to mechanical impact or heat
8657870 the design of custom solvents through first principles modeling opens up new possibilities for the dissolution of materials that are hard to dissolve
8657871 these are all strong indications that t costata may be the earliest example of marine overexploitation
8657872 our discovery that t costata was already on a trajectory of decline prior to this period corroborates this hypothesis by providing the first circumstantial evidence that humans were not only using but also depleting reef resources making t costata the likely earliest victim of anthropogenic degradation of coral reefs
8657873 declining marine and terrestrial resources by human and climatic factors respectively may have acted in concert to thwart the precocious but short lived colonization of the near east by anatomically modern but technologically primitive humans at the end of the last interglacial
8657874 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8657875 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8657876 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8657877 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
8657878 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
8657879 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter

8657881 whether its protecting gorillas in the republic of congo or monkeys and gibbons in cambodia conservation can and does work when you have government commitment and scientific knowledge on the ground
8657882 now we must put into place the management to truly protect these populations and apply the approach to other regions where primates are in trouble
8657883 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
8657884 wcs is therefore committed to continuing to work with the cambodian government to ensure that these globally important primate populations will continue to remain secure

8657898 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8657899 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8657900 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice
8657901 jika pemain kita memainkan bola bola atas atau sering melakukan operan melalui bola bola atas pemain kita akan kalah karena libya akan memanfaatkan tinggi badan
8657902 tetapi jika sebaliknya di mana kedua pemain sayap libya dibiarkan bebas beroperasi maka lini pertahanan indonesia bakal kesulitan untuk menghalau serangan libya

8657904 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market

8657908 we reported in the journal diabetes care in june 2007 that thiazolidinediones doubled the risk of congestive heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes
8657909 the increased heart failure appears to be a class effect
8657910 the unfavorable findings from the three trials have not been fully realized by the medical community
8657911 safer cheaper and more effective treatment alternatives are available that do not carry these negative cardiovascular risks in patients with diabetes the rationale for the use of the thiazolidinediones is unclear

8657927 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8657928 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8657929 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8657930 the wind blew them down quickly so we need to make some money quickly
8657931 youre going to have all the resources this campaign has available thats the good news
8657932 the bad news youre going to have a whole helluva lot of me because im coming home
8657933 i was a 29 year old kid running for the united states senate in 1972 there was somewhere between six and 10 busloads of people from scranton who just spontaneously got on a bus and came down literally there were hundreds of thousands of people
8657934 barack obama couldve made that speech were he alive in 1972
8657935 by the way if i hear one more time that he was 11 years old when i went to the senate im going to smack somebody
8657936 a sale to a chinese bank would provoke a very negative reaction from the government and public opinion
8657937 al lami was a moderate official and we are surprised by his arrest
8657938 senator obamas speech tonight will be as he himself has characterized it more workmanlike a very direct conversation with the american people about the choice we face in this election about the risk of staying on the same path were on the risk of just more of the same versus the change we need
8657939 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years
8657940 doing the speech at mile high is an important point for our campaign its symbolic of how sen obama won the nomination it will show how obama wants to involve people who are not usually involved in the political process
8657941 colorado is probably one of the most important states in this election if john mccain does not win this state he has a very very limited chance of winning the white house
8657942 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8657943 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there

8657946 it is important to the national interest to furnish assistance under the act in an amount not to exceed 5 75 million from the united states emergency refugee and migration assistance fund for the purpose of meeting unexpected and urgent refugee and migration needs
8657947 the complainant requests that the itc issue an exclusion order and a cease and desist order
8657948 it is vitally important that we better understand the mechanisms of disease transmission during blood transfusions so we can develop the most effective control measures and minimize human to human infections
8657949 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection this suggests that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for these diseases
8657950 since the results are consistent with what we know about human transmission the work helps justify the control measures put in place to safeguard human blood supplies it also shows that blood from bse and scrapie infected sheep could be used effectively in non human experiments to answer important questions such as which blood components are most heavily infected and to develop much needed diagnostic tests

8657957 people of various ethnic groups coexist in harmony and equality and the situation in xinjiang is generally good
8657958 this has nothing to do with any alleged persecution or oppression of the uighur people
8657959 it is part of chinas worsening crackdown in the area
8657960 the international community should prevent the chinese government from carrying out their systematic crackdown policies on the uighurs

8657970 shes also not eating very much right now and blames that on being busy the doctor says that she needs more calories to gain strength and ensure that her breast milk is healthy

8657975 you cant tell me aof is worse than underoath and doesnt play with better bands
8657976 i am honored to be here tonight to support barack obama and to warm up the crowd for joe biden though as youll soon see he doesnt need any help from me i love joe biden and america will too
8657977 i would support the cdb if the commerzbank does not make extensive job security guarantees
8657978 i strive for the huddle to be very relaxed and everyone focused on me
8657979 it has been that way if things go wrong if you have a dropped ball or a fumble and we recover you want guys to come back to the huddle and say hey you know what guys my fault ill get the next one
8657980 when you get that it reassures confidence in everyone else im not here yelling at everyone my job is to provide confidence i tell guys im coming right back to them and i need them
8657981 if you can get the feeling of youre up 21 youre going to play a lot better when you start thinking about stuff and worrying about stuff that messes your game up and slows you down a little bit it comes from experience but you have to be able to be in that situation where this is no problem were just going to roll down the field and get where we have to get
8657982 hes the president of the group he gets us in the positions we need to be in hes real loose and i like that about donovan hes not so uptight in the huddle that affects everybody when the person leading is relaxed and confident then everyone else is going to feel that and try to display that same attribute that he has

8657984 i see other people with their little flags or their bandannas or their belts or key chains and its really nice just to see other people on marta other people in the queer community in public out in public
8657985 i see more lesbian families like family units with the happy couple and their child on marta than i have seen gay male couples
8657986 its easier to get to because not all of the youth drive and so its very important the youth can get here by marta
8657987 i think if we werent as close to a marta station as we are a lot of kids wouldnt be able to come to the center
8657988 it makes them more involved not just in the cente r but in the city
8657989 its either queer folks noticing other queer folks or some random straight person starting mess
8657990 its rare that someone is just asking questions thats not trying to be an ass
8657991 there were like these straight guys or whatever on the train and one was like all these faggots on the train
8657992 it takes a lot more to offend me now so something like faggots i laugh at it i think its humorous
8657993 its almost kind of like at certain train stations you have to conform and you have to all of a sudden be straight just to keep from being harassed or keep from having someone bother you and taunt you
8657994 its not even about the gas prices its more about the responsibility factor and being intoxicated
8657995 the only thing i dont like is how marta ends at 1 a m and the bars close at 3 that doesnt make sense
8657996 but some clubs close at 3 and we be stuck
8657997 what we have to do is just wait until it starts running again
8657998 i guess the reason we dont do it now is because were a lot older and i guess in the black gay community its just they look at you as a nobody if you ride marta or catch the train
8657999 i just feel bad its just been pounded in my head a million times that oh you ride marta
8658000 like everything else could be there you could be in school have a job but guys will be like aw he rides marta he dont have a car oh well
8658001 every situation presents its own set of circumstances but i dont think its a disadvantage if someone rides marta
8658002 a lot of people are doing marta because its smarter but if youre depending on marta because of some bad choices thats a different conversation
8658003 she taught me how to use the trains a little bit and its something that i dont do since were not together
8658004 i liked her independence and confidence and familiarity with the city and thats something that i really dont experience as someone who is somewhat uncertain about marta

8658006 we undertook a strategic review of our business in republic of ireland looking at scale and the fit with our core uk business
8658007 the roi operation is the only part of hfc bank not operating in sterling which presents a challenge for us and were unable to make economies of scale to counter the extra costs generated by the change in currency
8658008 the differing regulatory legal and business climate between the two countries also represents a significant challenge
8658009 id like to take this opportunity to thank all our staff for their hard work and dedication during hfcs lifetime in ireland
8658010 we have now entered into consultations with staff representatives and we will make every effort to help staff throughout this transition to find alternative employment with the help of professional outplacement services as well as providing a generous redundancy package
8658011 it is a shame that we have lost damien duff for the two opening qualifiers
8658012 he started very well and he is a very important player in the irish squad
8658013 i am happy that fifa and the georgian football federation have made a decision to play the game against georgia in a neutral venue
8658014 we understand that it was a difficult decision to make but feel it was the correct one given the need to prioritise the safety of the players and fans
8658015 he has size 6 4 220 and great speed for his size
8658016 he has a chance to stick one way or the other
8658017 we encourage our players and work to get our people into the nfl
8658018 we sell that when talking to prospective players in the offseason come to philadelphia be on tv get exposure and get back to the nfl
8658019 its great exposure for the organization we want them to succeed and earn more money sure replacing them isnt easy but im always making calls on players behalf
8658020 i need to see him be better than he was last week
8658021 im not going to say he was poor last week but i want to see improvement he is on his second week here so there should be marked improvement there
8658022 theyre asking me to pick it up fast and im going to go as hard as i can but its somewhat of an experiment and its not guaranteed to work out
8658023 thats like me asking you how long it would take you to be an astronaut
8658024 if somebody hasnt practiced at something you can only expect them to do what you ask them to do and go 100 percent ive been there a week and a half so if i was comfortable there would be no point in going to camp for as long as we go to camp
8658025 we do that so people can practice a position and get better at it if a guy can just step in and be ready to go after a week then they wouldnt practice guys as hard as they do and wed save a lot of bodies
8658026 ive been here long enough and i havent been here long to know that you cant let anything surprise you i tell people all the time that i have the kind of job where i can come in and i might not have a job so being moved to a different position doesnt surprise me at all
8658027 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8658028 whether we get a bunch of attention or we dont i dont think were going to feel pressure we know what we can do i think were good i think we feel comfortable with each other theres great communication going on so far im anxious and ready for us to get into a real game and see us put together a whole game
8658029 were a pretty cohesive group off the field and i think it carries on to the field
8658030 not only are we similar in age but i think in interests and work ethic so i think its a good thing that were all the same age were all young and in a similar situation
8658031 chris started 12 games last season so hes pretty much a vet by league standards and stews a smart player who did start last year its not like theyve never seen a start in the nfl although stew is picking up full duty this year from day 1 he has done well with the checks and things of that nature he and chris are very smart players so im not surprised at all how theyve progressed
8658032 assignmentwise and our communication i think we feel pretty comfortable
8658033 were making sure we know what were doing and being in the right spots to be able to make big plays you always want to stay fundamentally sound but i think were feeling pretty comfortable out there
8658034 for me last year i was learning the wil and the mik this year concentrating just on the mik i feel like im over the hurdle of grasping what it is im supposed to be doing and when a play comes when im just reacting so far most of my reactions are correct so thats a good sign
8658035 mentors of young scientists need to exhibit the highest standard of ethical behaviour and collegiality
8658036 but all i know is that i got to prepare myself like a starter

8658041 now there are going to be 50 000 people or more at this show so everyone doesnt get to sit down and play it for an hour but well have six kiosks setup in our booth for folks to come by and have a chance to take it for a spin and myself and a number of devs will be on hand to answer questions and talk to folks
8658042 well also be giving out handy vault dweller survival guides to everyone that stops by the booth plus you have to come by and checkout the airstream
8658043 on saturday at 2 30pm we will be giving a new fallout 3 demo in the main theatre this is right after the main theatre session where gabe and tycho draw a strip
8658044 our demo will be pretty lengthy and shows a lot of stuff most folks havent seen we may have a chance to do a short q amp a with folks i dont know between the demo and what we have planned after the demo we may be pretty short on time if you like schwag i wouldnt leave early
8658045 its an incredible time to be around i wish my momma could have seen this day
8658046 with obama we make history if you ready for obama make some noise yo man lets do this for obama
8658047 the bad news is youre going to see a whole hell of a lot of me because im coming home
8658048 it is not hyperbole we cannot win without winning pennsylvania it is that simple
8658049 theres a lot of people i should recognize because as they say you brung me up

8658056 we need leaders once again who can tap into that special blend of american confidence and optimism that has enabled generations before us to meet our toughest challenges leaders who can help us show ourselves and the world that with our ingenuity creativity and innovative spirit there are no limits to what is possible in america
8658057 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created you can make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time
8658058 although these areas werent designed to protect against bleaching there is an expectation that they will protect an assemblage of fish fauna which will hopefully assist the reef to recover
8658059 the currents are probably flushing the reefs and removing any excess sediment which can discourage coral from settling
8658060 advanced wastewater and storm water treatment reduction of sedimentation and runoff from agricultural areas and no discharge zones for boater sewage are all ways to ensure that corals can survive
8658061 merely expanding protected areas without cleaning up the water will not
8658062 the whole point of developing a long list of potential locations was to get down to a shorter final list and we remain committed to announcing this final shortlist of up to ten potential locations early in the new year
8658063 there remains a serious shortage of housing in the cambridge area with almost 10 000 families on the waiting list for affordable housing and this is an issue that must be resolved
8658064 we have been clear that only proposals of the highest standards stand a chance of becoming an eco town
8658065 the promoters have decided they need more time to develop their proposal and we would expect it to be considered as part of the planned review of the regional spatial strategy
8658066 eco towns started off as an idea that sounded good but labours incompetent handling of the project has led to wide scale distrust amongst the public and developers alike
8658067 now even those who are behind the applications have decided that it is better to go it alone and forget the government sponsored eco con scheme
8658068 my hope is that it will encourage other countries to follow suit

8658074 all i knew was my family didnt have money and so therefore i couldnt go to college
8658075 i fell for the mission hook line and sinker i was like lets go kick some hajji ass
8658076 you had to be that way the moment you realize you dont have a purpose you fucking lose it

8658081 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me
8658082 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8658083 the site itself went from being a handy tool for organizing high school reunions to a drastically silly explosion of susie wants you to take the what type of candy are you quiz oh and you were bitten by a vampire invite all your friends to be vampires so you get points and be sure to update your status so all your friends including that person from biology 201 that you never talked to can stalk you

8658096 we just told the subjects to follow their intuition or gut feeling
8658097 if you are conscious you win much more money but you can still win money if you cannot consciously perceive the cues
8658098 this might now provide an explanation why we often base our decisions on intuitive hunches where a certain option somehow feels right
8658099 but we shouldnt be worried that we could be influenced against our will by such unconscious processes the study shows that the unconscious brain is intelligent enough to select the best options
8658100 as far as we know these are the most dark matter dominated galaxies in the universe
8658101 this implies that we are approaching the scale at which the properties of the elementary particles which presumably make up the dark matter are producing observable astrophysical effects
8658102 no this story isnt true and if you believe it youre a lunatic
8658103 a lot of folks are saying insert spurious assertion here but is it true
8658104 we undertook a strategic review of our business in republic of ireland looking at scale and the fit with our core uk business
8658105 the roi operation is the only part of hfc bank not operating in sterling which presents a challenge for us and were unable to make economies of scale to counter the extra costs generated by the change in currency
8658106 the differing regulatory legal and business climate between the two countries also represents a significant challenge
8658107 id like to take this opportunity to thank all our staff for their hard work and dedication during hfcs lifetime in ireland
8658108 we have now entered into consultations with staff representatives and we will make every effort to help staff throughout this transition to find alternative employment with the help of professional outplacement services as well as providing a generous redundancy package
8658109 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8658110 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8658111 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis
8658112 they fought and triumphed in many battles through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8658113 if one were to name those who have made the most difference to various movements whether its civil rights farm workers rights womens rights we all know whose those names would be
8658114 when it comes to the person who moved lesbian gay bisexual and transgender issues forward that figure would be del martin we all stand on her shoulders
8658115 the birds are living not dying but pcbs are affecting some part of their life cycle
8658116 one of things they can do is mess up hormone receptors in the brain and you need hormone receptors to develop correctly to be either male like or female like
8658117 the birds might look like they are just fine but they either cant produce a song or cant find a mate
8658118 it was kind of scary because their immune system was shot to hell
8658119 the females were preferring males that were singing better but the song wasnt an honest signal of quality
8658120 that is sort of the major achievement or milestone that we all had to reach
8658121 id like to hear and i would love to be a member of the research team or community that does define an efficacious therapy but i think it needs to be approached with enormous caution
8658122 no human subject committee would allow this kind of experiment to be done
8658123 i definitely want to be able to do this in my lab and a number of other labs will try to set this up as well
8658124 i spent five and a half years in a prison cell without i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i spent those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
8658125 and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses what it has to do with putting americans in houses and keeping them in their homes
8658126 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like
8658127 only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
8658128 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs
8658129 psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
8658130 the huge nitrogen and phosphorus rich prokaryotic biomass represents a potentially enormous and high quality food source for benthic consumers in deep sea ecosystems
8658131 it is surprising that viral activity directly impacts such a large fraction of the flow of material and energy at the sea floor
8658132 we think we have a real good team this year and were going to surprise some people
8658133 this is one reason why the testicles hang outside the main part of the body
8658134 is she saying that all depth on a character in modern games like gears of war and mgs4 are all created manually
8658135 so all the wrinkles in their faces are all full polygon models with meshes that are hundreds of thousands of points in a characters face alone
8658136 so my 400 gaming system has to process all those points on the fly making it more powerful than a program on a 5000 with an equally expensive 3d modelling program where all those points would have to be rendered frame by frame
8658137 it is unclear whether it is in any way related to orientation and navigation
8658138 these are animals that originally lived in dense forests or in grasslands prairies savannahs and steppes without landmarks
8658139 the number of clusters is extremely sensitive to that figure
8658140 this data allows investigators to identify suspects examine their contacts establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time
8658141 combining two different sources of data has the tendency to increase your false positive rate or your false negative rate
8658142 if youre looking for burglars in a run down district where 50 per cent of men have a criminal conviction you may find plenty but if youre trying to find terrorists among airline passengers where they are extremely rare then almost all your hits will be false
8658143 currently there are no good patterns available to recognise terrorists
8658144 now in 2008 these very characteristics are presented as value added selling points in the company advertisement of its product
8658145 the efficiency and reliability of such tools is as yet unknown
8658146 more surveillance does not necessarily lead to a higher level of societal security hence there must be a thorough examination of whether the resulting massive constraints on human rights are proportionate and justified
8658147 we implement stringent safeguards to prevent misuse of such systems for unauthorised purposes in all countries where we operate we do business strictly according to the nokia siemens networks standard code of conduct and un and eu export regulations
8658148 event which is aiming to be a zero emissions alternative to todays high performance
8658149 in the sustainable future that we want to live in you can still drive around in circles just because you want to
8658150 formula zero will be a competition between fuel cell technologies
8658151 one of the issues in introducing new technologies is customer awareness and acceptance and anything which demonstrates or supports that is welcomed
8658152 the students that are doing these events now are potentially the managers of our technology centres in 10 or 15 years time
8658153 while searching for bat carcasses under wind turbines we noticed that many of the carcasses had no external injuries or no visible cause of death
8658154 if bats are killed in canada that could have consequences for ecosystems as far away as mexico
8658155 when used in conjunction with for example hydro electric generation it is most certainly a reliable and very viable energy source
8658156 generally the impact of low frequency vibrations on human health is not well understood
8658157 smaller turbines can be noisier of course because of their scale smaller turbines are also more likely to be installed close to homes schools and businesses
8658158 we dont have to worry about what pollution is doing to the water supply because natural forces do way way more damage
8658159 all the more reason not to add to the problem
8658160 there is always going to be some adverse effect on something when we obtain power
8658161 bulldozes through controversy hosted the dali lama chastised mugabe and wants to make the euro a bigger player in global financial markets as the dollar wanes

8658173 one of the constant themes that comes through loud and clear from the people of north wales is that they want to see police officers out on the beat in their communities
8658174 new technology can help us make the best possible use of our officers so that they spend as little time as possible on paper work back at the station
8658175 it is vital that our officers are spending as little time as necessary locked away in a police station behind a desk and as much time as possible out in the street in contact with the public
8658176 one of the things that we are doing and we are leading the service in this is making better use of modern technology to cut down on that bureaucratic load traditionally undertaken in the police station
8658177 we can look at every photograph ever taken of anybody who has come into contact with the police
8658178 we have actually been able to separate twin brothers by their tattoos in a photograph on a blackberry
8658179 it is a phenomenally powerful tool and the great difference here in north wales is that every officer has got one already

8658182 roberts was in a position of trust and his actions have had devastating consequences for the charities and people involved
8658183 he was regarded as a family friend by two of the victims which has made his deceit even harder for them to bear roberts not only used the cash he had stolen to pay his business debts he also used it to fund his own lifestyle owning two properties and putting his children through university
8658184 the charities involved have had substantial amounts of cash stolen from them cash that they rely upon to be able to continue providing help and services to vulnerable people
8658185 the future of some of the charities is under threat as a result and i only hope they are able to get some of their money back now this case is over

8658269 it was in cathedra that israel knohl an iconoclastic professor of bible studies at hebrew university in jerusalem first heard of the stone which yardeni and elitzur dubbed gabriels revelation also the title of their article knohl posited in a book published in 2000 the idea of a suffering messiah before jesus using a variety of rabbinic and early apocalyptic literature as well as the dead sea scrolls but his theory did not shake the world of christology as he had hoped partly because he had no textual evidence from before jesus

8658276 gaining benefits requires solving a number of difficult scale out issues there is no one size fits all solution to database scale out you need to be able to flexibly combine and extend technologies to create workable solutions
8658277 for there to be increased adoption of open source databases at the enterprise application tier a number of factors need to be addressed
8658278 these include increased enterprise functionality improved service and support offering proof that performance fears are misplaced increased resistance traditional database software licensing and a move to web based architecture for internal applications
8658279 continuent tungsten is a very important database extension as it allows open source databases to support business critical solutions and provides a performance boost

8658284 now is the moment for any art collector art connoisseur or art lover looking for the next big name to seriously pay attention to the caribbean region the art simply cannot be overlooked
8658285 we find it imperative to represent an important selection of cuban artists at the international caribbean art fair icafair gives us the opportunity to show some of the exquisite quality in modern and contemporary cuban art
8658286 the caribbean has often times been overlooked in the history of art cuban artists have been producing incredibly powerful work that broadly ranges in styles icafair gives the new york public a chance to view some magnificent visions of its neighboring countries
8658287 exposing people to caribbean art can motivate them to visit the islands it happened in the 40s when haitian art was introduced and acclaimed by the international art scene and it will happen again for the entire region
8658288 when caribbean art reaches the global market the artist benefits and indirectly supports and stimulates art related industries in the islands

8658346 accordingly we hold that the court committed plain error when it failed to give the accomplice jury instruction and that clarks convictions must therefore be reversed on this basis
8658347 i would reverse clarks conviction outright and not remand for a new trial

8658367 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8658368 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8658369 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8658370 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8658427 a reference to our current president who i very publicly despise
8658428 i just cant stand the guy or his administration and it was about him going to the graveside of martin luther king one of my heroes and i think desecrating the memory of that great man and his work by being there during the iraq war
8658429 i found it pathetic so i wrote that song about it
8658430 this is a dream first commission for superbox and were very excited to have the most wanted duo in fashion fronting the series

8658435 confident without arrogance happy a guy who is fully at ease in his own skin unlike lena his uninhibited approach to life also makes him comfortable flowing in and out of relationships in a way that is foreign to her
8658436 just as the girls have matured left high school and are navigating their way in the world so brian has grown up hes not the awkward video game playing geek we first met although theyre both freaked out by whats happening their reactions are different brian is focused on working things out but tibbys impulse is to shut him out

8658438 i have a lot of respect for paris shes ballsy shes learned to play with the paparazzi attention and have fun with it and she creates little mysteries in the tabloid arena i have fun with her but its always been platonic our relationship wasnt sexual though i understand that sex sells
8658439 she and i have a very open communication were friends with common interests if you want to know the whole story youve got to be my friend its easy to put those labels on people but theyre not accurate were young in hollywood having fun

8658451 wed like to have a full fledged relationship and partnership but we dont need the illusion of a partnership when were being surrounded with military bases and when more and more countries are being included in the north atlantic alliance
8658452 there is a russia narrative that we were weak in the 90s but now we are back and we are not going to take it anymore but being angry and seeking revanchist victory is not the sign of a strong nation it is the sign of a weak one
8658453 russia is going to have to come to terms with the reality it can either integrate with the world or it can be a self isolated bully but it cant be both
8658454 suspected islamist militants detonated a remote controlled explosive device when the prison van was crossing a bridge over the kurram river killing six policemen and a passerby

8658457 people of various ethnic groups coexist in harmony and equality and the situation in xinjiang is generally good
8658458 this has nothing to do with any alleged persecution or oppression of the uighur people
8658459 it is part of chinas worsening crackdown in the area
8658460 the international community should prevent the chinese government from carrying out their systematic crackdown policies on the uighurs

8658470 considero que con maniche y ver banega tenemos dos futbolistas que se acercan un poco a lo que quiere aguirre tambi n consideramos que la solicitud del entrenador que es l gica y que hemos intentado cubrir tampoco se puede cubrir a cualquier precio

8658474 mladic may have had a plastic surgery but he is not hiding like karadzic
8658475 he not only changed his image but also the way he walked and talked
8658476 but when he cut his hair and the beard he started walking quickly like old karadzic that was the disguise
8658477 karadzic likes public appearances in the hague hell be like a fish in the water like milosevic
8658478 the profits are not there like they were the past couple of years
8658479 i dont think anybodys saying its going to be a year or two years down the road its probably more of a 5 or 10 year cycle and at that point theres potential for capital gain
8658480 really spend a lot of time understanding the numbers and what youre getting into
8658481 siempre lo admir y desde mi llegada a este equipo l siempre fue una de mis prioridades
8658482 the comment was inappropriate and extremely disrespectful towards senator roberts
8658483 as a united states senator representing kansas he deserves to be treated with much more respect its my hope that all staff members on the campaign will engage in a much more professional campaign from this time forward
8658484 multi cultural game development is a major theme when you are talking about a region such as the asia pacific
8658485 with the number of international companies we are presenting as well as some confirmed world exclusive premieres we are confident this years gca and gcac will eclipse last years show in terms of knowledge exchange and importance on a global level
8658486 gamesindustry biz is a vital and relevant news channel for the video game industry and a daily must read site

8658489 witch axe gonna by it marvy rose what there if tank glut treasure no pain
8658490 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia

8658495 at the conclusion of issue 2 it was revealed that mavis trent aka payback shares her body with a fearsome phantom entity that is somehow inextricably linked to her dead father
8658496 early on in issue 3 mavis finds herself a split second away from certain death but in that split second which will encompass a full 90 of the book we will learn the extraordinary series of events that bestowed mavis with her powers and motivated her to form the true believers
8658497 or to put it another way this issue is also the origin story
8658498 luke cage was always high on my list of potential true believers guest stars
8658499 whats unique about his explosive encounter with payback is the time frame because he meets her
8658500 all he knows for sure about this very strange looking woman is that shes unregistered like him
8658501 the second time around hell have a much clearer idea who and dealing with
8658502 as anyone who follows this limited series will discover most super heroes shun the true believers for fear of seeing their own secrets pop up in paybacks blog
8658503 since it will be revealed that these two entities are symbiote cousins for lack of a better term i think some sort of clash down the road is highly likely
8658504 the best way to destroy your enemy is to make him your friend
8658505 a couple of years ago i was like you know
8658506 if he can do it everybody else can do it
8658507 im very very disappointed that the boise citys prosecutors office has continued to make the judgment that this case is appropriate for a jury trial
8658508 focused on ways to better work together to defeat extremists on the border and to help pakistan deal with its own internal threats from extremism
8658509 they are coordinating complex infantry like attacks against fixed targets
8658510 is comfortable general kayani understands the threat and he and his forces are working to deal with that
8658511 we got a decent boost from the stimulus which hit the economy at a time when we really needed it
8658512 it will have less of an impact going forward though and we may even have a payback in the fourth quarter
8658513 we would have had growth even without the stimulus as much of the rise in gdp had to do with the trade deficit
8658514 without a price spiral the fed wont have to squeeze the life out the economy which should help sustain modest economic growth
8658515 n o sei se a viol ncia factual moderada ou in dita exagerada ou sentida

8658519 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful they expect you to be perfect they dont look at process anymore
8658520 its like what we havent gone to the final four what we didnt win the national title very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot
8658521 part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win
8658522 im not saying that it happens all the time but it happens at the end of that spain game most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career here at duke
8658523 each one of the coaches brings such a wealth of knowledge to the table and for a young coach to obviously be around coach k every day is an amazing opportunity
8658524 but to be around some of the other top coaches in the world and be able to pick their brains and learn the game through their eyes is just a wonderful opportunity
8658525 doing those two things at the same time afforded me an amazing opportunity to grow
8658526 throughout this time there have been sometimes articles you should do this you shouldnt theres no way that i shouldnt have done this for duke for me for our country for the kids i coach im a better coach to them a better person as a result and when i was coaching them it was that we didnt go to the ncaa final four during the last two years because we had two young teams and we got beat all of a sudden theres a reason shame on you you dont do that thats wrong the people who wrote about those things they were wrong
8658527 were going to go after it were going to do it and if some student doesnt go to the final four after their four years at duke then thats just too damn bad
8658528 but our team is going to have fun is going to be representative and theyre going to have the opportunity to grow just like our olympic team did
8658529 i couldnt do what brad and angie are doing i wouldnt have the patience or dedication you need to take care of a family i admire those qualities in other people but its not for me
8658530 im doing exactly what i want to i hang out with the same friends i spend time in italy and then i go back to work i try not to worry about anything else

8658532 a couple of years ago i was like you know
8658533 i am so surprised to hear that question that is honestly the first time i have been asked that
8658534 traditional project management practices which are designed to improve the likelihood of project success often have the opposite effect in a dynamic rapidly changing environment
8658535 theres so much rigor and normally so much documentation and so many processes you have to go through to follow a methodology that it weighs you down and that you cant move as quickly as the business needs you to move or as quickly as technology enables you to move
8658536 i think the secret is for her to wear a bunch of goofy crap around her face that distracts from her terrible nose job
8658537 punched her in the face when she was five months pregnant and broke her nose when their son was dying from cancer
8658538 she claims he threatened to kill her when she told him she wanted a divorce and says she was so fearful he meant it that it took years before she found the courage to leave him in 1994

8658547 fee schedule is inflated to make up for the discounts these providers must give the insurance companies to be included in their

8658552 to you he is called mccain to us lobbyists we call him mcgain
8658553 we think the proposal had very good prospects of succeeding under the governments eco town initiative
8658554 i think it is long past time that we all shut up stop making public statements about private disputes and get on with the job we are paid to do
8658555 clearly he chose not to do so that is a matter for him to reconcile with what he considers to be his proper responsibilities as one of this countrys most senior police officers
8658556 in doing so he and all other senior colleagues and i include myself in that need to remember what we are being paid to do and that is to enjoy the privilege of leading committed and professional colleagues in protecting the public that we all serve
8658557 our job is to work for the safety and security of people here in london so that they can enjoy their rights
8658558 it is their rights that need to be at the forefront of all our minds we need to ensure that internal disputes and personal issues do not detract us from this overwhelmingly important mission
8658559 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8658560 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics
8658561 finally it is to do with the victimisation i have suffered since my grievances leaked to the media
8658562 im content with my achievements so far im not seeking massive monetary benefits and i do not have grievances against the whole of the met an organisation that i dearly love and admire
8658563 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8658564 its going to be really exciting to meet the winners who will walk with other young people and their families to raise awareness and funds for juvenile diabetes im lucky to have great support from my family friends and fans
8658565 samantha drinks and passes the drinks under the table to lindsay and behind the scenes it gets worse and worse

8658568 the doctors said i have the early stages of pneumonia which a lot people probably have
8658569 the conduct of marine science on this voyage will not compromise the integrity of australias efforts to protect whales
8658570 if we were going to be fair dinkum about putting them under pressure we would say well look were not going to provide you with resources go find your own resources
8658571 the ministers in a difficult position but i think spiritually it compromises our argument
8658572 our policy is backed by australias leading drug and medical experts
8658573 we refuse to have a policy that is name and shame and which benefits no one
8658574 if you triple the sample size and the percentage of positive drug tests goes down then the trend of drug use is going down
8658575 i am appreciative of the strong support that continues to be provided by my parents and my sister sonja she said
8658576 in particular the strength friendship and assistance provided by my estranged husband dale continues to be invaluable despite the tremendous pressures that he is under
8658577 together with the excellent medical care i am receiving i have also appreciated the fantastic support from my amazing group of close friends and staff members
8658578 we want parents to have this information they want to know how their childs school is going
8658579 when they move communities they also want to know about the schools in their new community so they can make a decision about which school their child should go to
8658580 from the point of view of government we want to know where schools are falling behind so that through our new national partnership with states we can make extra resources available to help lift that school up
8658581 its part of ensuring that every australian school is a great school
8658582 i just think its really important that we acknowledge that multicultural nature of darwin
8658583 one option is a rotating prayer story another option is to just acknowledge country and get rid of the lords prayer
8658584 its probably more correct to do a recognition of country than to do the lords prayer
8658585 what about the prayer for the flying spaghetti monster wed better include the prayer for that as well
8658586 i think its a way for the council to show that they recognise diversity
8658587 usually its a prayer that relates to community harmony and peace and finding common ground
8658588 im careful about including groups that may be seen as having an agenda other than spirituality
8658589 ooh we better scrap our morning call to prayer for a christian prayer
8658590 teachers are overpaid and underworked kretins sic of our society
8658591 but in the case of politics its also to let their own opinion be heard
8658592 instead of playing some silly flash game why not play against vandals and do something useful at the same time
8658593 there are tools that revert vandalism very quickly up to eight edits in a single minute reverting vandalism is a lot faster than creating vandalism
8658594 its hard to write from a neutral point of view if you are so closely involved and as wikiscanner showed the edits can far from neutral
8658595 if people want to keep an eye on the changes made to specific pages users with accounts can use a watchlist that will show how those pages have been changed within the past few days
8658596 if its just something uncontroversial like removing vandalism its probably not going to be much of a problem
8658597 however there have been some recent scandals about politicians and their staffers changing articles so it might be better to avoid even the appearance of impropriety
8658598 mostly it depends on whether someone has been interested enough to start an article about the politician in question
8658599 because of the sheer number of topics it tries to include wikipedia has inconsistent coverage of all kinds of things and new articles are being started all the time

8658626 nach acht jahren in diesem amt kann ich ihnen sagen barack obama ist bereit dieses land zu f hren und amerikas f hrungsanspruch in der welt wiederherzustellen er ist bereit pr sident der vereinigten staaten zu sein

8658640 he is determined to reach his goals and the amazing thing is while the season has gone on he has actually gotten stronger
8658641 we stress the idea that pitchers need to throw strikes and not walk batters and we always try to have the fewest walks in the league when we start out
8658642 obviously we cant control everything though in the end it comes down to the guys and we have some really good guys this year
8658643 i think when you have had success before people are more likely to listen to you and buy into what you have to say
8658644 i have been fortunate to have worked with some hall of fame pitchers and pitched against hall of fame pitchers so i take what i learned and what has worked then pass it along

8658656 if you will seek god and make supplication to the almighty then he will rouse himself for you and restore to you your rightful place

8658659 maybe but nobody else did do it the way they did
8658660 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
8658661 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
8658662 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
8658663 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
8658664 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
8658665 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
8658666 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
8658667 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
8658668 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
8658669 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
8658670 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
8658671 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
8658672 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8658673 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
8658674 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
8658675 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
8658676 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
8658677 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
8658678 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
8658679 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family

8658684 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
8658685 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
8658686 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8658687 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
8658688 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
8658689 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
8658690 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
8658691 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
8658692 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
8658693 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
8658694 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
8658695 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
8658696 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
8658697 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

8658734 it s challenging and fun and the view is unbeatable
8658735 i always say sisters not twins when it come to eyebrows
8658736 try as we might to get them completely symmetrical you have two completely different hair patterns and amounts of hair on each side of the face
8658737 this allows you to see the natural growth pattern and shape of your eyebrows
8658738 get a pair of good tweezers with sharp slanted edges and pull hairs in the direction of growth
8658739 not sure where your eyebrows should be run your finger along your eyebrow bone
8658740 if you draw an invisible line from the corner of the nose straight up towards the forehead this is where the eyebrows should start the arch should fall just outside the pupil and should go all the way across the brow bone
8658741 using vegetable dyes to either lighten or darken the eyebrows is the best way to soften a hard look or add fullness and definition to a lighter sparse looking eyebrow
8658742 powder works best on oily skins and pencil on more mature or drier skins
8658743 not only do eyebrows serve as the frame to your eyes and face
8658744 but their main function is to keep irritants out of our eyes
8658745 brush eyebrows straight up and trim the hairs that stick out too far one at a time then do the same brushing hair down
8658746 after pulling a few hairs step back and look at the entire face
8658747 if you cant see the hair in a regular mirror then neither can anyone else
8658748 it is an old eyebrow myth that is heard too often to never tweeze from the top
8658749 every eyebrow is different and while some dont need this it is often required to achieve the perfect shape

8658770 what i am going to do to help them in their lives

8658832 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8658833 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8658834 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8658835 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8658836 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8658843 after the arrests attorneys from the peoples law project and the aclu arrived at the temporary arrestee processing site to conduct confidential attorney client consultations
8658844 the city refused to provide any access to allow these persons to meet with attorneys
8658845 i personally saw one such arrestee later at the city and county building i saw her marched from the elevator to the courtroom in bare feet and leg shackles i saw her appear in bare feet and leg shackles
8658846 some arrestees who could not make their own bond spent 6 7 8 or more hours waiting at taps before being transferred to court
8658847 the only access we were given to those clients was to whisper
8658848 one of our goals this season is to reinforce the ensemble part of our name by presenting larger cast plays close ties will allow our member actors with their shared history the rare opportunity to play three generations of the same family in this wonderful play
8658849 i believe in the players in that room that theyre capable of getting it done my minds not going to change
8658850 theres guys in there that know how to do it theyve been in this situation before theyve had to make runs before

8658852 i finshed high school when i was almost 19 turned 19 a month later because my mom had me held back in preschool because they thought i wasnt ready for kindergarten

8658858 but i know its there a little bit maybe just lunging for the bag it kind of grabbed overextended my muscle it sucks that it happened to be honest with you
8658859 hopefully its just a couple days or something like that
8658860 i think it was a classic case of a pitcher getting up in the zone and flattening out his sinker
8658861 he just had trouble getting the ball down in the zone and letting the movement work for him he got behind in counts and couldnt really get to his other pitches his breaking ball and changeup
8658862 we conclude that reversal of clarks conviction is necessary in the case to ensure fairness and integrity of the judicial process
8658863 accordingly we hold that the court committed plain error when it failed to give the accomplice jury instruction and that clarks convictions must therefore be reversed on this basis
8658864 we all sat down and aired out our differences and now guys who were feuding are working together early before games
8658865 its been a lot more fun to come out to the park and we want a ring
8658866 its always good when the players care enough to call a meeting and its paid off
8658867 when you pull together and play as a team youre supposed to have a different hero each night

8658873 we expect airplanes to be less full and skies to be less crowded this labor day holiday
8658874 economic uncertainty and the heavy hit from sky high energy prices mean that many vacation and business travelers are choosing to stay closer to home if they go at all

8658877 the order of canada these decisions are made independently of the government that said i guess my preference to be frank would be to see the order of canada be something that really unifies that brings canadians together

8658879 clc re iterates its request to the prime minister that the government set up a special committee to review the nominations with a view to ensuring this never re occurs

8658884 ottimo film con un ottimo cast a sorprendere senza ombra di dubbio la straordinaria interpretazione della gellar non che avesse bisogno di dimostrare la sua bravura ma in questo film ha pienamente confermato quanto potenziale abbia questa attrice che molti purtroppo sottovalutano il film che ho visto in lingua originale davvero coinvolgente e ben svolto certo probabilmente poteva essere ancora meglio ma di certo jieho lee ha fatto un ottimo lavoro considerando che il suo primo progetto importante sono ancora allibito per lo scarsissimo successo che ha avuto in usa del resto stato distribuito in sole 7 sale mi domando il perch di questa distribuzione limitata
8658885 film che ho visto in lingua originale temendo visto linsuccesso in america che non asrebbe mai uscito da noi splendido film con una splendida colonna sonora una slendida fotografia una splendida regia ed un cast assolutamente spettacolare balzato di prepotenza nell top 3 dei miei film preferiti perfetti forest whitaker brendan frasier kevin bacon e andy garcia ma a rubare la scenna senza dubbio e con mio grandissimo stupore sarah michelle gellar la tristezza personificata negli occhi pi incredbilmente espressivi che io abbia visto da tempo non so se ricever qualche riconoscimento per questo ruolo ma di certo lo merita vero collante per tutte le storie del film offre uninterpretazione di enorme spessore che fa pensare quanto questa ragazza appena 30enne sia altamente sottovalutata
8658886 un film come pochi come da tempo non ne vedevo sorprendente e inatteso il ruolo della gellar che avevo sempre considerato piatta nella recitazione e abbastanza superficiale ma qui ha dimostrato un talento che poche attrici hanno soffrivo con lei meraviglioso il resto del cast non vedo lora di vederlo in lingua originale

8658890 la comunidad de madrid con sus recursos es la que est atendiendo la totalidad de los servicios y sin embargo no recibe la financiaci n del estado respecto a este aumento eso debe estar reflejado en el nuevo modelo de financiaci n
8658891 incluidas las previsiones de actualizaci n referidas a la evoluci n de poblaci n
8658892 se han negado a aplicar el modelo de financiaci n vigente y sus instrumentos de revisi n y actualizaci n
8658893 han preferido por una decisi n pol tica y no de financiaci n un cambio de modelo fruto de una imposici n del gobierno tripartito de catalu a que le oblig aparte de a las modificaciones estatutarias a hacer un cambio en el sistema de financiaci n sin saber muy bien ad nde bamos hoy zapatero es preso de esa decisi n pol tica basada en sus intereses exclusivos de mantenerse en el poder con sus aliados nacionalistas
8658894 algo muy previsible y ahora al gobierno no le cuadra el sudoku como dijo el ministro de econom a pedro solbes
8658895 vemos desde hace varios d as en la prensa que diferentes presidentes de las autonom as gobernadas por el partido socialista est n en franca oposici n a los planteamientos del presidente de la generalitat catalana jos montilla y adem s cada uno haciendo reivindicaciones en raz n de sus propios intereses ayer zapatero reconoci que la situaci n se va a complicar va a ser lenta y que no est en condiciones de ofrecer una soluci n en el tema de financiaci n como en otras muchas otras cosas
8658896 un inter s partidario que le permitan mantenerse en el poder y nada m s
8658897 a raz n de la poblaci n que tiene madrid
8658898 no cuestionamos la solidaridad del sistema como hacen algunos representantes del psoe pero exigimos que financie servicios transferidos respecto a su poblaci n porque si no se est perjudicando gravemente a los madrile os y nosotros no podemos consentir que se les prive de la financiaci n estatal a la que tienen derecho para que reciban los servicios de calidad que est n recibiendo esa es la posici n que hemos mantenido y seguiremos manteniendo en los pr ximo meses
8658899 se iba de manera galopante a una crisis econ mica muy fuerte para la que el gobierno no tom ninguna decisi n en la legislatura pasada y sigue sin tomarla ahora
8658900 realmente es evidente que esta situaci n va a condicionar el curso pol tico y el escenario en que nos vamos a mover en el pr ximo a o hay montones de estudios que dicen que este a o vamos a entrar en recesi n y vamos a ver desgraciadamente d nde se sit an las tasas de desempleo y por lo tanto estamos todos movi ndonos en un escenario de dificultades econ micas que va a condicionar como es normal todo el curso pol tico
8658901 lo que debe combinarse con una mayor aportaci n de recursos a las comunidades aut nomas por el aumento de la poblaci n
8658902 lo que el gobierno central no podr seguir haciendo es la demagogia barata de que aqu nadie va a sufrir ning n recorte de nada cuando los ingresos del estado se est n desplomando los recursos econ micos est n cayendo y no est adoptado ninguna medida de naturaleza fiscal ni de reforma estructural para permitir m s dinero en la econom a y por lo tanto vamos a ver c mo demonios cuadra esta situaci n
8658903 pueda tener un reflejo en el funcionamiento de la financiaci n de muchos servicios p blicos en el pr ximo a o y puede ser que muchas administraciones y ciudadanos lo pasen mal porque el gobierno no ha hecho frente a esta situaci n

8658906 i think michelle obama kicked it off pretty well dont you think
8658907 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house down last night
8658908 someone who reminds us what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first thank you president clinton
8658909 even though we became the presumptive nominee some time ago it became reality last night and to see sen clinton be so gracious in moving our nomination by acclamation and really to see the eruption in the hall and the sheer sense of joy and excitement about the election was really a special moment
8658910 one of my earliest memories was being in that hospital dad always at our side
8658911 we not the senate were all he cared about he decided not to take the oath of office he said delaware can get another senator but my boys cant get another father however great men like ted kennedy mike mansfield hubert humphrey men who had been tested themselves convinced him to serve
8658912 barack obama and i took very different journeys to this destination but we share a common story
8658913 my mothers creed is americas creed no one is better than you you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8658914 almost every night i take the train home to wilmington sometimes very late
8658915 as i look out the window at the homes we pass i can almost hear what theyre talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed
8658916 thats the america that george bush has left us and thats the future george excuse me john mccain will give us freudian slip freudian slip
8658917 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8658918 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8658919 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8658920 now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8658921 i love this but we have important work to do tonight
8658922 i am honored to be here tonight to support barack obama
8658923 and to warm up the crowd for joe biden though as youll soon see he doesnt need any help from me i love joe biden and america will too
8658924 all star line up and came down to two remarkable americans locked in a hard fought contest to the very end
8658925 but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children and im grateful for the chance chelsea and i had to tell americans about the person we know and love
8658926 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8658927 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8658928 yes he can but first you need to vote for him
8658929 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8658930 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8658931 you know i am sorry if anyone was offended it was certainly not meant in any way to be offensive
8658932 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked him obama personally
8658933 you could say that no ones ever really prepared to be president
8658934 but if he knew how to make it bad then he knows how to make it right again
8658935 weve always been very impressed with him and i just wish he would continue to be an elder statesman like a younger jimmy carter
8658936 i remember going through each and every one of those primaries thinking this one is going to push her over
8658937 no its not this one is going to push her over no its not and so i think it was a continual process of being excited and anxious and let down excited anxious and let down
8658938 i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the further conduct of the roll call vote that all votes cast by the delegates will be counted and that i move that sen barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8658939 i am here today to release you as my delegates
8658940 many other people who sign their ballots will make a different choice
8658941 you are to be given the respect and recognition you have earned as delegates for the democratic party

8658943 youtube has gone above and beyond the law to protect content owners while empowering people to communicate and share their experiences online
8658944 we work every day to give content owners choices about whether to take down leave up or even earn revenue from their videos and we are developing state of the art tools to let them do that even better

8658946 the decision rendered here is confined to the particular combination of facts in this case and is not intended to push the bounds of the safe harbor so wide that less scrupulous service providers may claim its protection
8658947 the plaintiffs in the veoh case never bothered to send a notice of infringing activity to veoh before they filed suit of course once veoh was sued and realized what it was getting in trouble for it took down all the infringing videos so the court was sympathetic that veoh had been taken by surprise
8658948 by contrast viacom doesnt deny that youtube takes down infringing content when it is notified
8658949 if viacom flags a particular user that has uploaded a
8658950 there is an interesting and worrying phenomenon that the commission and national regulators have identified
8658951 in some cases operators are charging you for a call of one minute two seconds what they can charge you for two minutes this is a result of not charging by the second
8658952 a lot of operators resorted to billing whole minutes and not the exact amount of time the consumer uses
8658953 most operators did not change their billing system since the introduction of the roaming regulations
8658954 a difference that operators can use to attract consumers with different preferences

8658960 i call upon the people of the united states to celebrate the achievements of women and observe this day with appropriate programs and activities

8658965 veoh has simply established a system whereby software automatically processes user submitted content and recasts it in a format that is readily accessible to its users
8658966 veoh does not itself actively participate or supervise the uploading of the files nor does it preview or select the files before the upload is completed instead files are uploaded through an automated process which is initiated entirely at the volition of veohs users
8658967 this ruling suggests that youtube is also protected by the dmca safe harbors just as many had stated from the beginning
8658968 the key issues raised by io and also raised by viacom is that these sites lose their dmca safe harbors because they take action on the content often transcoding the content from one format into flash however the judge in the veoh case trashed that argument pretty easily
8658969 youtube has said 13 hours of video content is uploaded every minute on youtube
8658970 if its impossible for veoh to monitor all content youtube is going to have an order of magnitude larger problem if you take reasonable precautions against copyrighted materials on your service you may be ok

8659083 these criminals target people outside johannesburg so that when the victim is asked to fly through to or tambo they instead opt for the money to be deposited into their bank account and the only way they can do that is by giving the scam operators their banking details
8659084 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy people are suffering
8659085 that is the mandate that he mugabe was given by the sadc southern african development community regional bloc and he is not going to stop forming that new cabinet the mdc are not serious at all
8659086 that all zimbabwe stakeholders should go and sit and finalise all outstanding issues which will pave the way for establishing a stable and peaceful government
8659087 you will be killing the talks once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
8659088 once he does that forms a new government then he has put a final nail on this dialogue so what in fact you are doing is you are making people suffer and therefore declaring a war on the people
8659089 formally we are going to write a letter to the facilitator about the breaches that have occurred
8659090 may be a strategy to arm twist the mdc to accept the deal that is on the table

8659093 i dont know if this is a turning point but at least its a pause where rising fear is replaced with something more like rising uncertainty which is better than rising fear

8659109 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8659110 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8659111 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8659112 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8659113 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8659114 he s not the jamshad wyne that i once knew he has some kind of evil spirit on him these days

8659117 theres no way youre going to lose value quicker than to junk it
8659118 vielleicht h tte es fr her kommen k nnen aber ich bin froh dass es jetzt gekommen ist man kann die vergangenheit nicht zur ckdrehen
8659119 besonders vor 15 jahren als wir hier waren es war sehr ermutigend dass die j ngere generation das erfasst hat

8659121 2005 was a good year the previous year we were on different equipment he was on a factory fx bike and i was with erion the first year in fx our bike wasnt quite as developed as the factory bike at that point and i was still able to win a couple races
8659122 but in 05 we were on equal equipment and i thought okay heres my shot i started off reeling off race wins in the beginning of the year
8659123 miguel started reeling off some race wins of his own at the end of the year and was closing the points back down
8659124 it came to a shoot out at atlanta at the end of the year it came down to the last lap of the last race i just made a mistake going into turn 1 i cooked it in there a little too hot gt
8659125 i had been going in there easy all day long and i knew where my brake marker was that i could go to im not sure what happened i just didnt brake hard enough i guess i did something wrong but im still not sure what
8659126 i just couldnt get the bike turned and i ran out of racetrack and thats all she wrote
8659127 that was one of those races that ive only ever watched once but people still come up and talk to me about it
8659128 ive only watched it once and i would have probably watched it more than that if it was the greatest race id ever seen its probably more like the greatest race miguel has ever seen
8659129 we have repeatedly told the council that we do not intend to use general obligation bonds on the convention center
8659130 thats not something we have contemplated it is extremely unlikely and its not what weve charged anybody with looking into theres no intention to use any general obligation bonds to support the center
8659131 a shift to general obligation bonds will put it on our radar without question it will bump it up our list
8659132 there is concern especially on a project like this that is just apparently open ended in terms of expense
8659133 we have no idea what this monster is going to cost the problem is of course no one knows
8659134 thats not been close to my mind before i came along and since ive been involved it has been talked about that the flow of revenues that would pay for the project would be supported by users of the center thats still clearly what were focusing on
8659135 wow jessica how totally unremarkable is that its organic baby food just like i see at kroger

8659137 if you want to do it on a national scale where the transmission line distances will be much longer and utility regulations are different congress must act
8659138 we suggest that the weekly cycles may be related with changes in the atmospheric circulation which may be due to some indirect effect of anthropogenic aerosols
8659139 this whole enterprise of looking for weekly cycles is rife with possibilities for misleading oneself
8659140 if mdha gets its way it will become impossible for any home or small business owner in tennessee to prevail against an abuse of eminent domain
8659141 but then i weighed out the options if something wasnt wrong then no real harm was done if something was wrong i really had no option so obviously i had to tell her
8659142 id seen a news article here in the u k a few years ago something similar and it just sparked a memory of that also the word cancer sprang to mind with the same memory so obviously i was quite concerned and just decided to do more research
8659143 grateful cannot even begin to describe how we feel toward maddie
8659144 do i consider madeleine our hero most certainly if she hadnt sent that e mail rowans prognosis wouldnt be as good as it is
8659145 i suppose if thats how they feel then thats what i am to them
8659146 i think anybody in my situation would have done the same thing if they had known what i knew and had the opportunity to say it
8659147 i suppose im a hero in a certain sense but in another sense i think im rather normal and i care about people
8659148 it usually happens in infancy or early childhood and doctors precisely look in a babys eye with that light looking for a certain kind of reflection when that reflection is abnormal it raises the risk of whether this type of tumor is there
8659149 that white reflection you see in the babys eye is sometimes picked up just on routine photography in this case a web picture but what you hope is that doctors will see it internally before it gets to this stage
8659150 sometimes its there but its so faint it really appears later its hard to put blame somehow it was missed with our increasing number of premature babies there are other problems that could also sort of look like it
8659151 so it is a reminder for parents to ask doctors when you go for the baby checkup is everything ok
8659152 if something looks like this in a picture or your babys eyes arent moving together or one eye is bigger than another just pick up the phone and say somethings not right
8659153 obviously lag will be a huge problem for online play
8659154 were working on it in order to prevent the lag were thinking about trying to balance it up at user interface level and input timing by using joystick or something like that we still havent got a complete plan as yet were still working on it thats all we can say at the moment
8659155 i do think that online will be increasingly important especially in comparison to the arcade
8659156 a fighting game is essentially a fight between two people you can stick two pads in front of one screen but if you get better infrastructure you can start to play with an opponent far away from yourself online will definitely be the future of the fighting game

8659166 this is an exciting day for hockey fans in alberta and throughout canada
8659167 the bid group from alberta put forward a great plan and the site selection committee was particularly impressed with the bids focus on making tickets affordable for all hockey fans we had two outstanding bids to consider and both groups would have been great hosts of the 2012 iihf world junior championship today after completing the selection process we feel that alberta will present an event that will make all canadians proud
8659168 a joint calgary edmonton bid is a natural choice when it comes to the world junior championship
8659169 both markets are home to model junior franchises and some of the best junior hockey fans in the country
8659170 we are thrilled to have partnered with edmonton and won the bid to host this prestigious event
8659171 the world junior hockey championship is truly a canadian tradition and a tremendous event that we anticipate will bring significant benefit to the province of alberta the tourism industry and the hockey community

8659176 i have only worked with the team for one month so we will get much better
8659177 i dont know our rivals sufficiently to say what our chances are but the champions league is a rather difficult competition moratti said
8659178 mourinho is an expert and the players have gained experience this could be our year
8659179 roma is very strong and has experience and you need to put them at the top of the list of contenders because they also have an excellent coach moratti said

8659183 napoli has improved a lot and will continue to improve ancelotti said
8659184 mourinho is the man to beat juventus coach claudio ranieri said
8659185 its no walkover said scott blasi assistant to curlins trainer steve asmussen
8659186 divine park has won three in a row and wanderin boy has speed on the outside and if he gets loose anything can happen weve just got to take care of our own business if curlin gets position going to the first turn the rest will take care of itself
8659187 curlin is the best horse in the world on this surface and at this distance divine park trainer kiaran mclaughlin said
8659188 but since february divine park is undefeated and i dont think the distance will be a problem

8659192 veoh has simply established a system whereby software automatically processes user submitted content and recasts it in a format that is readily accessible to its users
8659193 veoh does not itself actively participate or supervise the uploading of the files nor does it preview or select the files before the upload is completed instead files are uploaded through an automated process which is initiated entirely at the volition of veohs users
8659194 this ruling suggests that youtube is also protected by the dmca safe harbors just as many had stated from the beginning
8659195 the key issues raised by io and also raised by viacom is that these sites lose their dmca safe harbors because they take action on the content often transcoding the content from one format into flash however the judge in the veoh case trashed that argument pretty easily
8659196 youtube has said 13 hours of video content is uploaded every minute on youtube
8659197 if its impossible for veoh to monitor all content youtube is going to have an order of magnitude larger problem if you take reasonable precautions against copyrighted materials on your service you may be ok

8659240 on the most important policy decision of our time the war in iraq barack obama is right and john mccain is wrong very very wrong
8659241 thats why i left a job at a law firm for a career in public service working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities
8659242 the same way he always has by bringing us together and reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are
8659243 john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis
8659244 i will always remember the boy who told me his mom worked for the minimum wage and that her employer had cut her hours
8659245 even today as oil companies post the biggest profits in history john wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks
8659246 john mccain wants to cut taxes for companies that make delicious ice cream sundaes feed the puppies of toddlers and fix veterans wheelchairs
8659247 to sit and worry about inflation expectations and what is going to happen to those rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
8659248 the way to get out of it is to act by interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus and other things to try to help people who are hurt through this
8659249 sitting by doing nothing is not going to get us out of this and hoping that a knight in shining armour will come and lift us out of this is optimistic in the extreme

8659339 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8659340 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8659341 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8659342 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8659343 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8659344 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8659345 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8659349 it has to be a very limited application i mean very limited it cant certainly get into other plays where an umpire has a view of an out or safe call or a strike zone call or whether a fielder caught a ball
8659350 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8659351 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8659352 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8659353 ive got all the confidence in the world in this team but ill tell you what were going to be tested
8659354 every game we feel like we have a great chance to win when he pitches
8659355 everybody is out there for one reason thats to try to get to october
8659356 the stuffs the same he still has a tendency to walk folks but his composure is a lot better than it was last year
8659357 its a shame we couldnt score a couple runs for him
8659358 hes so aggressive which youd rather have than a passive guy
8659359 but he has to remain aggressive within the strike zone a lot of it is concentration hes got to focus and concentrate on the ball coming out of the pitchers hand
8659360 ive been hoping in september hell be able to do more out there
8659361 i think hell get the bulk of the playing time
8659362 i think anytime you can help out umpires is good
8659363 everybody knows we are on a tough road trip no one has to remind us we just have to keep grinding
8659364 it was a good day all around it felt really good to get out there again and to win again was just a bonus
8659365 you play this game long enough and you know teams are going to hit skids like this its just part of the game but its still frustrating to go through it
8659366 we have to worry about whats going on here if we take care of our business the standings will come out if we keep winning were not worried about the diamondbacks just like theyre probably not worried about us

8659375 by far most companies are pursuing very limited footprints toe prints really instead of comprehensive ones
8659376 a company that is looking to move toward bio based materials may find it far more cost effective to encourage purchases of green power in its supply chain when they look at its total supply chain carbon footprint
8659377 the water treatment process can remove bacteria chemicals viruses and other contaminants from water much more effectively than conventional water purification methods
8659378 its major benefits include an easy to use chemical and physical treatment process that cleans water without requiring additional energy and uses recyclable non toxic base materials like the waste product silica and water which bring costs down these features make it a very attractive alternative to desalination which incurs high energy costs
8659379 unisas nano solution to water purification has the potential to prevent disease and poisoning of millions of people
8659380 eventually were going to see a tremendous amount of waste heat recovery applications but thats 5 to 10 years off
8659381 we have to get to that 10 percent efficiency threshold to start making it viable
8659382 the market is a lot of wasted energy and that is by definition a zero cost feedstock
8659383 if energy prices keep going up the economics keep getting better
8659384 clary said appliance maker bosch has shown interest in making a home heating unit with an attachment that makes electricity from exhaust heat at 10 percent efficiency a home could meet its power needs with the heat on

8659399 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
8659400 now i missed a few years of the cold war as the guest of one of our adversaries
8659401 obama talks about his service as a community organizer neither we nor the press begrudge him that and john gets to tell his story of service why anyone would argue he shouldnt is beyond me
8659402 my public profile is inextricably linked to my pow experiences obviously such recognition has benefited my political career and i am grateful for that
8659403 but i have tried to make what use i can of vietnam and not let the memories of war encumber the rest of my lifes progress neither have i been content to accept that my time in vietnam would stand as the ultimate experience of my life

8659455 when only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like minneapolis denver we dont need 6 000
8659456 by maintaining thousands of highly accurate nuclear weapons on alert the united states perpetuates the only threat that could destroy it as a functioning society a large scale attack by russia launched either without authorization by accident or by mistake because of a false warning of an incoming u s attack
8659457 by giving nuclear weapons so large and visible a role in u s policy
8659458 the united states has increased the incentive for other nations to acquire nuclear weapons and reduced the political costs to them of doing so
8659459 by contributing to a climate in which possessing nuclear weapons is legitimate
8659460 the united states has also undermined the ability of the international community to prevent more states from acquiring them the united states can and should take the lead in promoting an effort to clear the path to a world free of nuclear weapons

8659480 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8659481 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8659505 nobody is asking what is happening in the republican party why mccain did not invite muslims or why there are no muslims in his cabinet why he has not visited a mosque
8659506 i think there are occasions where you have acutely felt that our national party was not as open as you wanted it to be you are a part of this party and we are a part of you we are stronger as a party and a nation when we make room
8659507 we have a once in a generation nominee in barack obama who can help us find our way back to each other in common cause
8659508 the democratic party embodies the best interest of the american people and they should support the values that underlie that
8659509 i think the idea that americans are bigoted and will not tolerate muslim leadership is not true and we should simply start setting the record straight

8659531 were happy to promote biogas for our partners and their promotional users
8659532 powering a childrens ride at the state fair with biogas is a celebration of the great efforts of californias dairy farmers to help us meet our energy needs
8659533 were proud to partner with these innovative dairy farmers and demonstrate the potential for the states agriculture and power sectors to work together to meet californias climate goals
8659534 were just trying to evaluate if an anaerobic digester project to create biogas for energy makes any sense whatsoever
8659535 it appears to at first blush but were just trying to dig into it a little bit to see if it makes sense to dig into it a lot
8659536 we will determine the sweet spot for a radius of influence around the community to pull in organic wastes
8659537 if it does prove feasible to actually create a biogas then we will determine what is the best use for it is there an industry that can just use raw biogas for a waste heat source or would it make sense to do gas cleanup to the point that it could replace dry natural gas either for injection into the pipeline or to replace dry natural gas that is used for local industry
8659538 thats a very simple question about a very complex situation i dont think it has a simple answer i guess the simplest answer i could give is that under the right conditions and with the right vision and moderation the answer is yes would i validate people who would say it might be unsustainable in certain circumstances that answer is also yes
8659539 back in 2005 biomass was not a hot topic it became so with higher energy prices
8659540 we really got involved in this study because we wanted answers we wanted to understand the economic barriers that were controlling the industry and the ecological boundaries of sustainability
8659541 we partnered with the u s forest service because they were already making fuel management a high priority especially near urban areas
8659542 it turns out that the superior national forest has a lot of development like that embedded in the forest they were developing plans to reduce fuels and were eager to understand how biomass markets and harvest could factor into what up until then had been a cut pile and burn fuel reduction
8659543 the third piece that we kind of stumbled into was the administrative complexity the land management mindset
8659544 all of the procedures were set up with high value timber in mind while biomass is a low value product that probably will have to be harvested below cost you cant have loggers bidding to get the forest service the highest return on the contract when you are doing biomass and really subsidizing the removal
8659545 the future of biofuels lies in cellulosic ethanol and next generation biodiesel produced from non food feedstocks that do not encourage land use changes
8659546 the projects that sdtc wants to support under its nextgen biofuels fund will bring cellulosic ethanol and next generation biodiesel one step closer to market and help secure canadas position as a world leader in the renewable fuels industry
8659547 one of the largest applications of furfural was to convert it into tetrahydrofuran
8659548 now that oil prices have gone sky high theres a strong interest in producing furfural again because it really looks like it could be cheaper
8659549 the whole objective of our biorefinery is to cook up wood under pressure and relatively high temperatures to remove lignin
8659550 we get furfural as a consequence of the conditions that we use in our process
8659551 we regard this technology as being the closest thing to a high quality biorefinery
8659552 we take wood and split it up into its various fractions and get the highest value we can for each of those fractions
8659553 russia does not feel isolated and is not afraid to be isolated
8659554 thats a demonstration of complete confusion the product of a sick mind
8659555 will be to the detriment of the eu as much if not more than to russia i certainly hope reason and common sense will prevail
8659556 the essential aim of the summit following the latest russian declarations is to show europes unity and capacity to act balancing the need for dialogue and the need for firmness towards russia
8659557 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict to make the situation more tense and create a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8659558 do i look like your shrink i have killing to do

8659561 it may be a function of social perceptions of alcohol in that particular region
8659562 it has had a very negative impact on our day to day life
8659563 i think this is less about barack telling people about barack than barack communicating he knows more about people and their lives
8659564 none of the candidates on the other side give me a shiver
8659565 i think im more in touch with the american people as far as my policies my proposals and my ideas
8659566 is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8659567 i think republicans probably secretly pray that they have one republican somewhere in america who can achieve the same results that barack has achieved in this campaign
8659568 unlike other people he has a big measure here hes going to be measured against a guy he knows real well barack obama
8659569 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas

8659597 the health inequities we see in the world are absolutely dramatic in their scale
8659598 between countries we have life expectancy differences of more than 40 years a woman in botswana can expect to live 43 years in japan 86 years
8659599 one of the recommendations in the commissions report is that there should be universal health care systems that are available to people regardless of ability to pay
8659600 virtually all advanced countries have universal health care systems but we dont think that should be limited to high income countries we think that could be much more broadly available
8659601 we are distressed by the reports we see of health care simply being unavailable to people because of inability to pay we see that throughout low and middle income countries
8659602 its not perhaps the best use of the money that is being spent and there are a lot people who feel that and would actually like to see coming out of the current campaign in the u s proposals for a universal health insurance
8659603 the importance of prevention continues to grow partly because of escalating health care costs we simply cannot afford the way we go about doing health care nowadays without tackling and doing more prevention
8659604 that is what drives some of the problems youre involved in

8659616 im just really shocked its not something you expect to happen on your first night in manchester
8659617 it was really quiet then i just heard a big bang i thought it was our house at first then i realised it had happened next door
8659618 there was glass everywhere but at least the woman living there was okay we moved here because wed heard it was the safest place for students to live in manchester
8659619 i heard a bang and the sound of glass smashing it was bad enough to shake our house there was smoke everywhere we have just moved in it was all quiet and then that happened
8659620 we were watching football on tv when it happened the tv was shaking we ran outside because we thought someone was trying to break in
8659621 we could see the woman inside trying to get out she was on the phone to the police a man helped her to get out
8659622 its just incredible its devastating she left me a message saying i think some sort of bomb has gone off in the house
8659623 were waiting for experts to make a more thorough assessment of the scene to try to establish exactly what has exploded to cause that amount of damage
8659624 what is apparent is that some sort of incendiary device has gone off in that porch area and has caused a significant amount of damage to the porch and indeed the front of the house as well
8659625 were unclear at this moment in time but looking at it it appears that something was pushed through the letterbox into the hallway or placed into the porch and has blown out
8659626 we can tell that by the way the debris has fallen on the driveway its a miracle that no one was hurt when you see the amount of damage
8659627 whoever did this clearly didnt care if anyone was hurt or killed and needs to be caught the damage was quite breathtaking
8659628 i cannot speculate on a motive for this but we are clearly dealing with people who have no regard for human life
8659629 one time i squished a chicken so hard that an egg fell out

8659631 i have a studio in my house and that made it easy for us
8659632 id usually have a beat made or wed just make one right on the spot or even a whole track and wed just go to work there was no particular process it was party the night before to get something to talk about then wake up in the morning and make a song about it
8659633 we werent signed to geffen yet and we werent paying attention to that
8659634 we were just creating a sound and an artist just for the sheer fun of it
8659635 its an incredible time to be around i wish my momma could have seen this day
8659636 with obama we make history if you ready for obama make some noise yo man lets do this for obama
8659637 in a society when we very rarely let our mobile phones out of our sight its quite amazing to think that for a lot of us the minute we jump in the shower someone might be checking up on us
8659638 flirting is age old but the fact that it can now be tracked on your phone makes a nervous partner a paranoid text checker
8659639 if you suspect that your partner is up to something talk about it text checking can turn into a vicious cycle and it can easily be avoided
8659640 this life is a short journey how can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time
8659641 if this isnt a reminder of how short life is i dont know what else could drive that point home
8659642 i could be doing so much more with my life with that in mind im going to come up with my own list of things i want to accomplish before i die and set out to achieve them sometimes you just gotta live like you were dying
8659643 let this be a lesson to all of us dont tempt fate i will never make a 100 list bucket list or any other list of things to do before i die it almost assures you of an unfortunate accident
8659644 instead of using plant branches this patented approach takes malleable roots and shapes them into useful objects for indoors and out
8659645 after earthquakes and after tsunamis the only structures that still survive are trees
8659646 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8659647 they spend a lot of time commuting or working and we would like to use that dead time to enable them to access services such as this one
8659648 we want to tap into the smaller towns and cities where our customers may not have access to the internet but can upload profiles using a preloaded application
8659649 of course the parents want to be involved in the process but they are also open to using newer platforms such as mobiles to scout for their soul mate
8659650 marriage is serious business and there is a lot to it than just looking at a profile but its a start and a risk that i am willing to take
8659651 the lawyers are proving how organized they are that they have total consensus and this protest will continue until the chief justice is restored
8659652 today workers at invesco field are putting the final touches on the newest wonder of the modern political world the temple of obama
8659653 it is upon this pulpit that barack obama will tomorrow night adress thousands of screaming adoring fans
8659654 no i never thought i would live to see it i thought it would happen one day but i never thought i would live to see it it will be a great thing to have lived to see it
8659655 q during the primary you suggested that bill and hillarys relationship with the black democratic base had been irreparably damaged

8659661 we tried to get plouffe to react to a spate of national polls showing a tightening race all we care about is these 18 states he said he repeated with emphasis that the campaign does not care about national polling instead the campaigns own identification registration and canvassing efforts provide the data he uses to determine where to invest money and resources

8659669 yesterday the mccain campaign issued a statement effectively endorsing and echoing the latest baseless attacks sponsored by former swift boat funder harold simmons
8659670 with that screechy fingernails on the blackboard voice of hers it is impossible for hillary clinton to deliver a great speech

8659672 we have the utmost respect for ap this is not a hostile gesture by any means
8659673 its the beginning of an assessment of our business model not the end
8659674 maybe that decision by the philadelphia inquirer to hold back most of the newspapers copy from its website except for breaking news until the newspaper has been distributed has some real merit
8659675 i think we all had fun once we knew it was all safe
8659676 i normally dont take the time to write to anyone on the internet because they are so rude and closed minded but i must object to your flippant use of the term psychic in the banned message i received first off i did nothing wrong on purpose to you if something was wrong it was a mistake my mother has done a lot of work with local law enforcement and once for fbi she helps people while you punish them ive not yet developed my skills enough to help anyone but i do have glimpses many reputable brokerage houses and even former presidents rely on psychics for decisions maybe if you opened your mind you wouldnt need to punish people for no reason
8659677 dude your troll option dont make sense i know yall think that it means someone bad but trolls used to be good theyd build stuff if you left them bread or wine and they made the viking gods armor and spears dont let a few years of internet people destroy what something means be smarter than that yall dont have to play follow the leader learn about trolls i guess some were bad and you have to trick them into cutting open his belly in an eating contest but that doesnt even matter when it comes to what your saying do some research
8659678 this lady doesnt like the message you get on our banned page
8659679 my mother has done a lot of work with local law enforcement and once for fbi
8659680 i guess some were bad and you have to trick them into cutting open his belly in an eating contest but that doesnt even matter when it comes to what your saying

8659689 i have been impressed with what congressman mcnerney has done in his short tenure in office
8659690 congressman mcnerney has served his constituents well by helping create family wage jobs in renewable energy bringing home federal funds for important infrastructure projects in our region working to make sure veterans have access to services theyve earned and being open available and accessible to members of our community
8659691 he puts the needs of his constituents first thats why he earns my endorsement
8659692 because they feel the church is not relevant to their lives
8659693 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines

8659699 the essential aim of the summit following the latest russian declarations is to show europes unity and capacity to act balancing the need for dialogue and the need for firmness towards russia
8659700 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict to make the situation more tense and create a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president

8659704 wir haben eine produktion von 50 tonnen biomasse pro jahr
8659705 ein bescheidenes kohlekraftwerk ein 500 megawatt werk verbraucht am tag 3000 tonnen kohle man br uchte 5000 tonnen algen pro tag um diese menge co2 zu binden
8659706 es geht nicht darum ein kraftwerk co2 frei zu bekommen es geht um die produktion von biomasse das ist eine viel gr ere geschichte
8659707 algen werden weltweit gez chtet man kennt die leistungsdaten ich verstehe nicht warum man ausgerechnet in hamburg noch eine pilotanlage braucht
8659708 man muss sie entweder filtern oder zentrifugieren das aber kostet wiederum energie
8659709 sie haben eine ausbeute von 0 2 gramm trockensubstanz pro liter sie m ssen also 5000 liter wasser filtern um ein kilo trockensubstanz zu erhalten das ist ein enormer aufwand sie brauchen immer mehr energie als sie ernten
8659710 deswegen wird eine biodiesel produktion aus algen niemals konomisch sein
8659711 selbst wenn das ganze noch optimiert im besten fall w rde der liter biodiesel 50 euro kosten
8659712 wir w rden auch eine l ngere version mit mehr kapazit t ordern

8659727 they are coordinating complex infantry like attacks against fixed targets
8659728 is comfortable general kayani understands the threat and he and his forces are working to deal with that
8659729 i think they squandered a grand opportunity and its largely the fault of producers who were shameless and greedy people of dismal taste who were more interested in making deals than films and who made a lot of money for themselves and so canadian films do not enjoy a larger reputation anywhere and its a pity a lot of damage has been done

8659740 barnaby himself told friend samantha mallinson he had taken four ecstasy tablets that would seem to be consistent with the readings of the toxicologist
8659741 i think on two occasions samantha mallinson saw him fall over or nearly fall over at some point he has gone up the steps to the balcony possibly for fresh air
8659742 the next thing we know there was a thud and its clear he has fallen from the balcony this was an act of accidental death
8659743 he worked out exactly what he wanted to do and he did it he was an amazing person
8659744 he was a loss to the theatre as well as a great loss to our family
8659745 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8659746 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8659747 we are being very cautious and following process to do things right
8659748 ozone is a more powerful oxidant and disinfectant than chlorine and breaks down the byproducts of algae which can give the water an odor and taste
8659749 ozone is already being used in about 200 water treatment plants in the united states
8659750 we are in the very beginning of the final stages
8659751 our customers have said the water tastes better and we know ozone is more effective
8659752 it seems to me there are now three distinct groups of hillary clinton supporters

8659762 im extremely pleased to announce the launch of tracemonkey an evolution of firefoxs spidermonkey javascript engine for firefox 3 1 that uses a new kind of just in time jit compiler to boost javascript performance by an order of magnitude or more
8659763 tracemonkey advances us toward the mozilla 2 future where even more firefox code is written in javascript firefox gets faster and safer as this process unfolds
8659764 the goal of the tracemonkey project which is still in its early stages is to take javascript performance to another level where instead of competing against other interpreters we start to compete against native code
8659765 we have bugs to fix and an enormous number of optimizations still to choose from but were charging full speed ahead on the work we need to do for this to be a part of firefox 3 1
8659766 depending on the benchmarks you choose you might see massive speed up minor speed up or maybe even some slowdown those latter cases are definitely bugs and reporting them through bugzilla will be a big help
8659767 this means we are ready for mobile and desktop target platforms out of the box
8659768 as the performance keeps going up people will write and transport code that was too slow to run in the browser as javascript this means the web can accommodate workloads that right now require a proprietary plugin

8659795 selama saya menjadi panglima tni tidak pernah tni menerima dana dari exxonmobil untuk masa masa sebelumnya saya yakin itu tidak pernah ada
8659796 pembuktiannya bisa dilihat dari laporan keuangan exxonmobil yang pastinya lebih tertib mencatat setiap pengeluaran mereka termasuk dana untuk pengamanan tadi biasanya walaupun mengalokasikan dana seperti itu mereka kan tidak tahu uangnya dipakai untuk kegiatan apa oleh tni
