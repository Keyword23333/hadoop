1340033 what investment guarantees do is provide the investors if they want to in suffering the ups and the downs they can protect themselves against the downs

1340039 im disappointed that there hasnt been recognition that one of the major drivers of public disengagement and disempowerment from local councils is that we have an unfair electoral system which makes many councils one party states with no incentive for voters to turn out or for councillors to be responsive to their electors we need a more proportional voting system to elect councillors
1340040 all experience makes clear that there is no point in pursuing the localist debate if three requirements are not met that elected bodies run some substantial public services that they own some institutions and that they raise some discretionary taxes the franchise must bite without such bite all democracy is play acting and all devolution empty paternalism

1340079 een echt artikel is gebaseerd op overtuigende argumenten waardoor het een geloofwaardige bron van informatie is en niet iets dat met een korrel zout moet genomen worden
1340080 er is een nood aan geloofwaardige onafhankelijke media en de marketingsector zou geen pogingen mogen ondernemen om die geloofwaardigheid te ondermijnen
1340081 het lijkt wel alsof er voor online activiteiten andere normen gelden

1340135 theres actually a scarcity of funds to make loans and weve never encountered that before
1340136 theres not a scarcity for the and thats the funds used most to fund college these days for people who have to borrow
1340137 all of which means the team should be able to come to terms with pedro alvarez their no 1 draft choice with this unexpected windfall there is no reason for the pirates not to be able to meet the demands of alvarezs agent scott boras the pirates knew going into the draft boras was the most demanding negotiator in sports and often asks for the outrageous now the pirates with the money they cut from payroll in these trades have the wherewithal to comply with his demands
1340138 the really really annoying aspect of the trades was the insistence of some both pundits and apologists that since the team wasnt winning with bay and nady trading them was the right thing to do thats the height of convoluted thinking such reasoning suggests bay and nady were the reason the pirates were losing
1340139 theres quite a lot weve lost a couple of bridges quite a few culverts washed out and then of course theres major damage up in the northwest and well also begin the process of assessing damage to private property
1340140 its too early to tell the costs but just based on the damage weve seen up in the northwest its into the millions probably for repairing roads and bridges
1340141 we all hope that weve seen the last of the rain
1340142 water levels are still coming up around the province were still concerned about that and we have flood warnings in effect for the saint john river and were also concerned about water levels over on the miramichi river but i think in a lot of the small rivers weve already seen the peak
1340143 so it would imply that people who have a mutation in this gene and are susceptible to cancer have inherently regions of their dna which are duplicated or deleted and therefore are unstable
1340144 and that may have something to do with the mechanism by which they develop cancer
1340145 what is also striking is that with each successive generation the cancers tend to occur earlier in age and may also be more aggressive biologically
1340146 so rather than what we have to do now look for everything at every age which becomes an extreme burden on the patients and their families you may be able to say for such and such a person in the family we only need to focus on this tumour type starting from this age
1340147 hope for the future hope that in an lfs family that the legacy of loss will end
1340148 we know cancer to be basically a disease of genetic instability in the cancer cells and all weve done here is use an unusual model to show that that instability is actually present in every cell in every person

1340153 a gps is not direct satellite gps the satellite gps goes to a server then your location comes from the local cell tower thats why sometimes its not that accurate in nyc also how the lack of cell towers can simply bring a gps to a stop
1340154 get there early we open early at 8 00 a m for iphone 3g sales monday through saturday and 9 00 a m on sunday be sure to arrive early since iphone 3g is sold on a first come first served basis
1340155 whether the iphone 3g has a universal power supply 110 240v 50 60 hz neither the store expert nor i could find any apple literature that states the ac power specification does anybody know for sure
1340156 so in essence i can come in here upgrade her line again and get another phone then transfer that new phone to my line and reactivate her original 3g back on her line
1340157 as long as you have an eligible line on your account you can get the lowest price on the phone so yeah you can do that its in essence a hardware swap on the line
1340158 what apple did by letting you get 2 phones on one line was unethical you already have the phone so we cant back charge you for the rest of the full price but just know that what apple did was wrong
1340159 transfer purchases from i experienced the same problem yesterday for the first time
1340160 a gps will not work out of cellular network and my experience with verizons version was that despite clear blue skies and low brick buildings on a wide avenue the location was so off it must have defaulted to a tower or the satellite had crashed i decided to drop the service and verizon with it to buy an iphone

1340164 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1340165 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
1340166 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1340167 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1340168 you have pleaded guilty to a large number of very serious offences particularly taking into account the 68 offences which you have placed before us
1340169 the nature of this abuse to the victims was particularly offensive
1340170 both the harassment and the criminal damage offences were targeted very often to homes of the individuals involved and were vindictive in nature
1340171 by your own admission this course of action was intimidatory
1340172 we cannot ignore the stated intent to interfere with the democratic process
1340173 we do have to say that we regard the charges and the offences against you as to be very very serious indeed so serious that custody would be an option
1340174 this was a disgraceful and criminal campaign aimed at intimidating candidates and voters and subverting the democratic process takes action to determine why watford conservatives failed to investigate the matter properly and to ensure that such an appalling course of events is never repeated
1340175 i am relieved that ian oakley has pleaded guilty and that the nightmare of the last three years may finally be coming to an end

1340215 if youre home raising a family were not going to deny you the trust payments
1340216 you want beneficiaries to have a voice but not a controlling voice because they will inevitably want to increase the amount of money paid out of the trust to them
1340217 leave enough flexibility so youre not ruling from the grave
1340218 err on the side of giving the money to them anyway
1340219 i tell them to think about what values they want their kids and grandkids to have typically work ethic and responsible management of money

1340261 recently been in contact with roger and hes actually working on the script right now
1340262 from a progress standpoint its probably gone a little bit slower than what we would have expected
1340263 we have a much broader palette because it takes place at the smithsonian so theres a bunch of different museums we get in and out of like the air and space museum and the art galleries we go into paintings and stuff and then theres just this incredible ensemble cast we also have new people like christopher guest and hank azaria amy adams so its really been fun because its a lot less lonely than the first one

1340265 they showed me some footage but i dont have a feel for the movie i didnt see enough i wasnt sure who the terminator was i dont know if there is one or if hes the star or the hero these are the things that determine the success and how the strong the movie will be
1340266 i still dont know how it will play out with this one

1340271 the shoot with the handbag was a good challenge for me to put away my fear of appearing the way i did
1340272 i want to move away from the miss world image that was five years ago now
1340273 i didnt have any doubts about posing for a mens magazine
1340274 it was a totally professional shoot all the way through
1340275 its not a big step up from underwear and bikini shoots which lots of girls do every day
1340276 as much as i love modelling its not a career with longevity
1340277 thats why im going into tv presenting i love communicating an idea to an audience
1340278 i would probably get a place in england if things really took off there
1340279 i like a man who knows how to treat a girl
1340280 i dont mean in monetary terms i mean someone who will spend the same time and attention on you as he will on his friends
1340281 i like it when a man is not afraid to show affection in public when a man will hold your hand or kiss you in public a man who really understands what a woman likes
1340282 i see that couples who are good together have similar goals and so on but their personalities can be quite different
1340283 hes definitely more relaxed than i am im very driven well hes driven too but im driven in a more highly strung kind of way
1340284 i have never been driven by the idea of having fame itself if fame comes with success thats fine but success is important

1340288 there is great value in the markets at the moment avcs are a long term investment as long as the charges are low or modest then avcs which are invested in equities are a very good way for providing a future income
1340289 its a fundamental principle of long term investing that if you want to achieve higher returns you must accept higher risk and volatility along the way so your fund will go down as well as up in value
1340290 perhaps this is the highest reward that any dacoit in the country was carrying at present
1340291 no sooner our informers gave a tip off on thokias movements in the chillkhori forests our stf got into action a 24 member stf team that had earlier been detailed to track down this bandit was already present in the neighbourhood so they instantly took positions following which an encounter ensued
1340292 and it was only after a nearly four hour long fierce exchange of fire that our cops succeeded in bringing him down
1340293 even though other members of his gang managed to escape we have launched a hot chase and i am sure we will get them soon
1340294 some of his gang members were also injured in the ambush and we are searching for them
1340295 we will have a dna test carried out to ward off such rumours and to further confirm his identity
1340296 momma do you know how long i will miss auntie kaeley for
1340297 i am really hoping we are going to see and hear some great talent from all parts of the country i know how much an audition like this can change your life so my advice is to go for it
1340298 if im neither on the elevation church staff nor a spouse of a staff member does anyone really view my blogs anyway
1340299 one of the best ways to slim according to an eminent obesity specialist is to remain in bed under a doctors supervision for two to three weeks absolutely without food drinking only water and orange juice
1340300 indeed very few are in a position to afford the luxury of such a treatment for though it may not cost anything in food over that period it does necessitate a domestic upheaval such as few can contemplate
1340301 years ago it was realised that eggs were a source of cholesterol and people were advised to cut down but its now clear that eating eggs doesnt give you high cholesterol
1340302 bad saturated fats of animal origin butter cheese meat are what raise cholesterol
1340303 people may be confused by changing messages about whats good and bad to eat but nutrition is a young science thats still evolving all we can do is update our advice based on the most up to date information coming through
1340304 different countries suggest different quotas its only five portions here because so many people eat none at all
1340305 the size of portions is culture specific guidelines from the world health organisation suggest 400 grams per day an apple is around 80 grams or one fifth of requirements you can also take one portion as fruit juice even made from concentrate but only one because you need the fibres too
1340306 these numbers err towards caution but use common sense if you feel fit and healthy you probably have your alcohol intake about right
1340307 cutting carbs from your diet may have short term weight loss benefits due to water loss from a decrease in carbohydrate stores but eating carbs in moderation does not directly lead to weight gain the body uses carbs for energy and going too long without them can cause lethargy
1340308 but some of that can be taken from fruit and veg which are high in fluids
1340309 if youre involved in sport you should take on more tea is a good source of fluid although i wouldnt recommend taking all your fluids as tea five or six cups a day is okay as tea only has half the caffeine levels of instant coffee
1340310 the omega 3 fatty acids found in fish are excellent brain food
1340311 these essential fatty acids that are also good for the heart and have anti inflammatory properties which keep joints working and combat arthritis
1340312 our message is that theyre all pure fat and should be spread very thin you have more leeway with a low fat spread that comes from a source other than animals
1340313 olive oil is high in monounsaturated fat which controls bad cholesterol and raises good cholesterol bringing a range of benefits
1340314 the figure is meaningless it assumes people know what moderate exercise is on a scale if one is being asleep and 10 is keeling over exhausted you need to be hitting a nine by running training or swimming until you cant do much more at least three times a week
1340315 o grande prazer que as pessoas tinham ao comprar um carro pode ser dividido hoje em dia em 20 pequenos prazeres por exemplo se voc tem 2 milh es de ienes aproximadamente r 30 mil pode dividir esse montante em 20 envelopes e comprar uma viagem ir a um restaurante caro a teatros cinemas etc

1340320 once you had rock classics on the ads the private event bookings became viewed as pedestrian offences if they were still viewed as a crime against the old ideals they were usually downgraded from a cultural felony to a mercenary misdemeanour

1340329 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1340330 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1340331 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1340332 why dont they ask to give us something that we can use to help us make our case
1340333 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1340334 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1340335 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1340336 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1340337 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1340338 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1340339 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1340340 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1340341 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1340342 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1340343 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now lets trust the truth
1340344 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved
1340345 they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did and the people actually involved and of course theyre all through the book on the record talking about how it all worked
1340346 were not striving to become the worlds largest media company
1340347 i think its an inspired thing to do i want to thank dan for enabling me to see another side of garfield some of the strips he chose were slappers oh i could have left that out it would have been funnier

1340355 we know very little about ebola and how it spreads
1340356 we dont even know the animal that spreads it around

1340365 todays data center needs to always be responsive to business demands and as this survey indicates senior it people are becoming more aware of the business strategies needed to make this happen
1340366 lets go youre here im here lets debate the issues
1340367 roe went over the pamphlet point by point tearing down davis accusation
1340368 then he called davis out he challenged him to a debate right then and there
1340369 it blew me away i guess he was both scared and mad davis ignored the challenge but he got feisty too a few minutes later he was ushered away and into a car
1340370 i guess you live and learn he got up and left me the people and the pig
1340371 davis said roe was lying by saying he davis had pocketed money from pacs and special interests
1340372 roe pretty much told him the way i grew up when somebody calls you a liar you go out back and settle it
1340373 he may have been there and he may have got up and talked but he did not address the issues
1340374 and ive never been called a liar in my life
1340375 he called the person a liar and told him one time to shut your mouth
1340376 i can guarantee you theres not many challengers topping contributions to incumbent congressmen so that shows were making a run
1340377 i feel great about my chances and ive been out there pounding the pavement
1340378 several months ago he davis wouldnt even call me by my name he would say my opponent now on television and radio he calls me by my name
1340379 i am optimistic about the outcome of this election and i plan on continuing to represent the interests of the voters in east tennessee
1340380 i am looking at a number of measures and i am not going to be drawn on that today because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do
1340381 it is helping people that is important i want to look at a range of options that will help people
1340382 it is very difficult to speculate on what will happen to house prices over the next year or so
1340383 but it is perfectly true that our economy along with every other economy in the world is going to slow down and that slowdown is pretty dramatic in many places
1340384 in relation to the housing market there is no doubt that a combination of peoples general mood and outlook and the fact that mortgage finance has been constrained is pushing prices down
1340385 i dont need to because the bank of england has an obligation to target inflation but also to act in support of the governments general policies
1340386 so its remit is perfectly adequate to allow it to take everything it needs to into account
1340387 at a time when things are difficult where inflation is a problem that is looming one that i think can be dealt with i dont think this is the time to start changing the remit for the bank of england
1340388 i have said before i believe we can get through this i believe we can win the next election provided we discover the same zeal and enthusiasm that we had in 1997 2001 and 2005
1340389 i think the prime minister is very focused on what we need to do to recapture peoples enthusiasm
1340390 the prime minister when he comes back from his holidays will set out very clearly what he intends to do
1340391 i am very clear in my mind provided we can get across to people what we are for the difference government can make the clear principles of fairness that govern everything we can do then we can turn the situation around
1340392 i have exactly no doubt about that david was making exactly the same point
1340393 i believe fundamentally what we stand for a fairer society where everybody gets the best opportunity for themselves and their families that is something that only a labour government will deliver
1340394 that is what we will deliver with gordon brown we will get through these difficulties we can turn the situation round and we will turn the situation round
1340395 my main focus at the moment is working with energy companies to see how we can help people meet the higher bills they are facing at the moment
1340396 i doubt well get rooney fit for the start of the season with the virus hes had
1340397 its not going to turn the thing around sometime soon
1340398 the housing market needs all the help it can get but im not sure abolishing stamp duty would hugely change matters
1340399 it might help obviously anything would help but the fundamental problems in the housing market go deeper than that
1340400 it would be yet another thing that would hurt the governments finances they are in such a mess at the moment you wonder if they can afford it
1340401 this is something the hbf has been championing for a number of months as one of a range of proposals to invigorate the housing market
1340402 it is a welcome initiative and shows that ministers appreciate the problems the current housing market situation is causing people looking to buy and sell properties and the impact it is having on the wider economy

1340408 its wonderful its just the most amazing thing in the world hes changed my life hes really centered me anytime i think anything else is important i just see his smile hes made me the best person i could be
1340409 sometimes theres someone you may be trying to become friends with or you may even be thinking about going out with the person but because of all that it can never get off the ground thats just a nuisance

1340689 the district court mistakenly limited its analysis primarily to the embodiment requirement
1340690 as a result of this error once it determined that the buffer data was clearly capable of being reproduced i e that the work was embodied in the buffer the district court concluded that the work was therefore fixed in the buffer and that a copy had thus been made

1340692 these facts strongly suggest that the works in this case are embodied in the buffer for only a transitory period thus failing the duration requirement
1340693 cablevision we note also has subscribers who use home vcrs or dvrs like tivo and has significant control over the content recorded by these customers but this control is limited to the channels of programming available to a customer and not to the programs themselves cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the video on demand context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing for these reasons we are not inclined to say that cablevision rather than the user does the copying produced by the rs dvr system as a result we find that the district court erred in concluding that cablevision rather than its rs dvr customers makes the copies carried out by the rs dvr system
1340694 cablevision argues that because each rs dvr transmission is made using a single unique copy of a work made by an individual subscriber one that can be decoded exclusively by that subscribers cable box only one subscriber is capable of receiving any given rs dvr transmission

1340826 put his fingers penis in on and rubbed victims vagina
1340827 he hit her in her bottom lip with his hand
1340828 bruising and or possible faded bite marks to right rear buttock
1340829 consistent with suspects confession that he struck her in buttocks with belt
1340830 appear more similar to severe hickeys than to actual puncture wounds or tears to her skin
1340831 the shape of a mouth is clearly seen on the bite marks with some spots having clear indications where teeth touched the victims skin
1340832 dental molds of the suspects teeth via search warrant for comparison purposes to the photos of the bite marks on the victim
1340833 have a lack of definition that is necessary for effective and conclusive comparison purposes
1340834 tewes provided general basic information regarding the bite marks on the victims skin that may or may not be of relevance for court and or testimony purposes
1340835 corroborated the suspects claim that he beat the victim with a belt mainly a 2 3 inch linear abrasion on her back as well as other bruises on her body

1340839 we werent really welcome to the neighborhood when we moved
1340840 just trying to make him out to be a monster
1340841 ask him preliminary questions regarding the incident in question and to obtain a feel for him in terms of his pending court testimony
1340842 disclosed that on the day of the incident in question suspect ronald hinton beat him with a belt previously undisclosed
1340843 each observed marks on his back consistent with being hit with a belt
1340844 the dna analysis of evidence in williams homicide came back and ronald couldnt have done things he confessed to
1340845 now its back and it shows he didnt do it
1340846 hes afraid of police because of what happened to sean hinton the detectives balled up their fists and threatened him and told him he could go home if he said he did it he just wanted to be out of there
1340847 somebody else did and theres other peoples dna at other places too different people
1340848 going to make things worse who did these things to that poor child
1340849 when i got home i noticed a hickey on her forehead on her left side
1340850 i said where did you get that and she said she had fallen getting a towel and i got right on the phone immediately and called her mother and let her talk to her mother i tell her mother any time they got injured playing or anything thats the first thing i did
1340851 bruising and or possible faded bite marks to right rear buttock

1340853 its a bunch of hooey and a lot of hearsay
1340854 and youre not going to be able to go into it
1340855 thats when i kept on telling them like leave me alone
1340856 if the dna matched i would accept that he did this
1340857 it doesnt so i still believe he said he did it because hes so afraid of the police
1340858 hes in a cell by himself with two shelves and a bed the bed is comfortable and theres enough room for him to pace back and forth and pray to god
1340859 it hurts me because i feel so helpless now that i cant help him its so sad janiya is gone and that hurts me too but what about the dna the prosecutor said to the jury dont worry about the dna the dna doesnt matter in this case well whats so different about ronalds case
1340860 i am so tired of the falsehoods about my family my husband killed himself ronald did this to janiya ronald is abusive i am just not going to accept it if the dna matched id have no choice to accept it but it didnt and i wont accept it
1340861 i know about that she got bit on her arm playing with her cousin a few days before
1340862 i would never ever say i did anything i didnt do especially something like that

1340882 the substantial easing of monetary policy to date should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity
1340883 although downside risks to growth remain they appear to have diminished somewhat and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased
1340884 the 19 oil price decline coupled with the steady deterioration in employment and housing figures is an undisputable combination for the fomc to issue a more dovish or less hawkish statement
1340885 the possibility of higher energy prices tighter credit conditions and a still deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth
1340886 monetary policy makers will need to carefully assess incoming information bearing on the outlook for both inflation and growth

1340895 it has been an honor and a privilege to have run as a senator from new york for the presidency and i was so proud as i went around the country to talk about new york and i hope maybe dispel some myths and disabuse people of some of their inaccurate information about our city and our state and so it was in all ways extraordinary and an incredibly personal honor and i now am out as many of you are campaigning for senator obama working to make sure we can carry on this campaign and the causes and issues that are near and dear to us
1340896 i was very touched by mikes concern for me over these last months every since the campaign ended and you know i was really moved that he wanted to talk about the campaign what happened how it happened how you did it what was the reaction that you got what was effective and what wasnt effective you know what worked in advertising and in direct mail and i mean he was so interested in me that i was just transformed

1340945 i used to live in the brick lane so am really familiar with whitechapel market all markets are notorious for generating rubbish and a market as large and busy as whitechapel in the east end is bound to create tonnes of waste
1340946 i am really pleased to support the councils efforts to recycle it and prevent a significant amount going to landfill each week
1340947 we have pulled out all the stops to make whitechapel market the first to recycle 100 per cent of the waste it generates
1340948 each stall holder is responsible for putting recyclables in their allocated recycling bins and we are very pleased that they have fully supported what we are trying to do here
1340949 markets by their very nature can create a lot of waste when you take into account things like packaging and food products with a relatively short shelf life we have introduced a number of new ways that all this can be recycled and we are very excited that none of the market waste will be sent to landfill
1340950 on various dates in august and september 2004 on behalf of the council mr pate undertook transactions with a broker x which were not for a purpose relevant to the councils function but were undertaken by mr pate to assist x
1340951 the committee considered that there was a very considerable breach of trust and an extremely serious breach of the bye laws
1340952 the committee emphasised that mr pate had caused the council to act unlawfully and that he did so knowing his responsibilities which he deliberately disregarded
1340953 newcastle borough council has been informed by cipfa of the disciplinary proceedings against mr pate
1340954 the basis for the proceedings occurred four years ago and the borough council has since reviewed its treasury management procedures and improved controls to reduce risk
1340955 mr pate a qualified accountant was subsequently dismissed from his position
1340956 cipfa has acknowledged that the low risk transactions authorised by mr pate were carried out at a time when the market was stable and that there was no risk to the councils capital sums
1340957 we would not wish to make any further comments in addition to those already made by cipfa
1340958 tasers are making a real difference on our streets not only keeping the public safe but also protecting our police officers

1340987 we all know the risks safety measures and technology have improved in racing but it does still happen
1340988 its obviously very sad craig was a great guy and a great rider he was a genuine person it is a big loss to sport
1340989 im looking forward to getting back behind the wheel of a prototype car although i know i have to adapt quickly to driving this type of car again all season ive been driving a number of different historic cars and it really is a different world from driving a high down force machine such as this
1340990 i dont know the circuit and have never driven the lola before but this really was too good an opportunity to turn down i have very fond memories of racing with intersport and have a huge respect for the team weve been talking all season with clint and jon field about the possibility of doing some races so when this opportunity came up at the last minute i decided to go for it the american le mans series along with the lms in europe really is the place to be at the moment and i am looking forward to the race immensely
1340991 ive read so much about the place from the great can am races of 1970s right through to the present day its one of americas greatest road racing courses and to drive there in an lmp1 car will be a very special experience for me
1340992 ive thoroughly enjoyed the historic racing season so far and have driven some incredible cars but i have missed modern racing throughout my career as a non professional driver ive thrown myself in at the deep end but things have always worked out well for me ryan and john did superbly to score a class podium in the last round at salt lake city and my target is to do a good solid job alongside them this weekend
1340993 im really pleased that rob will be joining us for road america
1340994 we hope that his busy racing schedule might allow him to return for further alms races but well have to work that out in due course we all wish patrick a speedy recovery and look forward to welcoming him back as soon as he feels able to return to the cockpit
1340995 thinking back to last year it was quite difficult to race as it was raining but actually my engineer did a very good strategy
1340996 our car was really good balanced and consistent so im very confident for road america this year the longer race may change our strategy but really the only one we have now is go as fast as we can and dont collect any damage and risk ending up finishing in a bad position
1340997 its quite a difficult track to set up a car for
1340998 its long and you need to have a good set up for both slow and high speed corners bumps and kerbs as well it takes time to set up the car but we have a good base so i think that each time we go out we can just improve the car
1340999 i may not have been to the track before but im really looking forward to the whole experience ive raced against the team and its drivers a number of times so it will be great to join them this weekend and hopefully get some great results
1341000 i think the fram team was looking to have a better western swing back to back to back races in denver seattle and sonoma calif
1341001 we looked back at the western swing with the knowledge that we went past the first round at every race we held our own in the points and maintained no
1341002 i look forward to this part of the season im geared back up to go on the road
1341003 the real challenge is going to come at the u s nationals we all know that when the points get close there youd better be on your game but i feel pretty good going into brainerd and the rest of the season
1341004 more people are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and it is vital that firms treat them fairly
1341005 this means paying attention to their individual circumstances and not repossessing their homes when there may be an alternative solution repossession has to be the last resort
1341006 we see many homeowners owing very small amounts of money whose lives are wrecked by some particularly sub prime lenders racing to repossess
1341007 the fsas call for fair treatment of customers is a good first step but as the regulator it must now put its money where its mouth is and clamp down on merciless mortgage lenders who are robbing people of their homes
1341008 its not going to turn the thing around sometime soon
1341009 the housing market needs all the help it can get but im not sure abolishing stamp duty would hugely change matters
1341010 it might help obviously anything would help but the fundamental problems in the housing market go deeper than that
1341011 it would be yet another thing that would hurt the governments finances they are in such a mess at the moment you wonder if they can afford it
1341012 this is something the hbf has been championing for a number of months as one of a range of proposals to invigorate the housing market
1341013 it is a welcome initiative and shows that ministers appreciate the problems the current housing market situation is causing people looking to buy and sell properties and the impact it is having on the wider economy
1341014 however if it is to deliver the desired benefits it needs to form part of a co ordinated package of measures including crucially action to get liquidity back in to the mortgage market as well as further steps to assist first time buyers and moves to ensure much needed housing production is maintained
1341015 stamp duty in its current guise creates distorts the property market if the government is contemplating a temporary holiday we would urge it to conduct a review of some of the taxs more fundamental flaws
1341016 hundreds of thousands of people have extended their homes or dug out their basements rather than pay the huge sums in tax which crossing one of the thresholds creates that is a significant distortion
1341017 equally in the residential investment market it is wrong that an institution should pay stamp duty at the top rate on the aggregate amount of a portfolio whilst individual investors will pay a significantly lower rate per unit
1341018 therefore while any temporary cut will be welcome in the short term if it helps kick start some activity in our moribund housing market the government needs to think more strategically about reforming stamp duty so that it better supports people moving and encourages institutions to invest in housing supply
1341019 current market difficulties and private misery illustrate that policy should not be promoting ownership at all costs
1341020 private rented homes have housed more people this century than social housing and owner occupation combined we need measures to boost rental and to help shape quality housing that is truly affordable
1341021 with their creativity vision experience and international pedigree i believe mecanoo are the perfect choice to help us deliver an innovative world class building which the people of birmingham can be truly proud of

1341026 there are a few highway patrolmen around phoenix who know me pretty well
1341027 i was totally stoked to get my first outlaw win just before knoxville this gives our young team the lift we needed we recently made some changes that have made us even more competitive and i cant wait to see how that works for us in knoxville
1341028 i came away from the last round quite frustrated as i really wanted to get another win for the airwaves ducati team but its made me more determined to kick up a gear and get back onto the top step of the podium ive worked with my engineer on the gearing of my airwaves ducati 1098r so im confident well have a good set up for the weekend ive also been training really hard over the past couple of weeks so im feeling in great shape which is going to be really important over these last few rounds of the championship
1341029 oulton park was a massive disappointment for me but since the moment we decided not to race my focus has been on getting back aboard the airwaves ducati its been good to have a few weeks off to fully recover but im glad to be heading to knockhill its a circuit that i am confident the airwaves ducati can perform well at my aim this weekend is to get my championship back on track so i need to secure some strong results for the airwaves ducati team and get onto the podium
1341030 we found a fantastic tree with a hollow about 8ft off the ground and the children were playing in it
1341031 tom shouted ive found an old wetsuit boot and flung it out i caught it and was astonished to realise it was a hobnail boot
1341032 the sole of the boot has lots of nails hammered in to give it grip so it looks as if it was a fashionable boot that has been turned into a working boot
1341033 its been well worn with a large hole in the toe
1341034 as to how the boot got in to the tree we can never know for certain
1341035 since it is of childs size and worn out i suspect some childish prank or game at that time when money was scarce children needed to be adept at making up simple games
1341036 we have been coming up with different theories about how it got there
1341037 im a school teacher so will be using he boot and the mystery surrounding it for a creative writing project with my class in the autumn
1341038 the selections are reminiscent of our childhood favorites but with grown up tastes
1341039 when you see that trading is done not by consent but by compulsion when you see that in order to produce you need permission from men who produce nothing when you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work and your laws dont protect you against them but protect them against you when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming self sacrifice you may know that your society is doomed
1341040 this left us a legacy of underperforming schools underperforming and unresponsive city services littered streets and alleys thousands of vacant buildings and vacant hearts
1341041 to drive progress and build trust with the public we started doing something equally revolutionary
1341042 we started geomapping every conceivable service so we could measure outcomes and performance every day every week and every month
1341043 know where our problems are and where our opportunities are so we deploy our resources to where we can make the greatest progress for all
1341044 with goals with performance measures and with gis mapping we were able to empower our citizens to reverse four decades of what had been a seemingly insurmountable population loss
1341045 and guess what we made baltimore a cleaner safer healthier and better place for kids to grow up we started gaining population again and under my successor mayor sheila dixon the progress continues and today the city has achieved its largest reduction in homicides in the 30 years weve been tracking those numbers
1341046 ram n and rosario are special people i met them 30 years ago in venezuela
1341047 i want to recognize you in a small way for your lifetime of work in this field
1341048 the department of the interior is the embodiment of the theme of this conference geography in action
1341049 the decision was based on extensive geospatial information and mapping that showed a long term threat to the polar bears sea ice habitat satellite imagery helped make the case for the listing and helped me explain my decision to the american people
1341050 theres no end to the importance of geospatial technology in problem solving whether its mapping wildfires or earthquakes to put plans in motion to protect communities or using it to help find new energy sources while still protecting wildlife
1341051 until recently our agencies have largely worked in isolation from each other
1341052 even within agencies data might be developed for one project that could be but isnt used for other projects because it is not readily accessible

1341061 thats exactly what happens when we get filled up with emotion we cant handle
1341062 kids teenagers everyone impacted those who were really close to these individuals they need that stability
1341063 were going to do what we have to do to meet your needs
1341064 our teens are under a lot more pressure than some of us even realize

1341067 we want to do our best to be sure that people understand that they can access the agencies that are located in major metropolitan areas
1341068 we have to set ground rules ask questions never give up on it
1341069 if we are successful with this lawsuit they are going to have to lure businesses here with lower taxes and a better business environment instead of here heres 2 million for your company

1341073 most people dont see a lot of what goes on behind the scenes
1341074 the greatest thing that ever climbed into a race car
1341075 why has remotely sensed data been ignored in the past
1341076 it may be specialist data but it is still geographic information
1341077 when an economist needs the information from the image for a bar graph to show a three point change thats what we do we dont make him look at a pretty picture we bring the data to him
1341078 talk about whether there will be coastal inundation or drought not what the elevation is
1341079 the allegations were serious as no one was allowed to insult others especially in a school environment

1341083 everyones going for me and i dont know what theyve been doing out there to prepare
1341084 hopefully we will draw strength in seeing both our great comeback versus greece in 2004 knowing to never give up
1341085 we also saw how small the difference is between winning a medal and not when we played russia in the bronze medal match
1341086 as you get older and have more big match experience you become more confident in your own game as an individual player and also as a team
1341087 we have a solid team one through 12 the olympics is such a different kind of tournament its such an emotional ride up and down
1341088 it takes a real strong athlete and a real strong team to do well i thought we had that in the last olympics and since we have so many guys carrying over from that team i think we will have it this time
1341089 we feel very confident that we have selected the best team to represent this country at the upcoming olympic games
1341090 we have a good mix of experience and youth and we have 12 very good volleyball players on this roster they work well together both on and off the court and they compete at a very high level
1341091 i hope this is going to be the gold medal match in beijing
1341092 we played in australia the first tournament of the year against them

1341098 sen enrile has a statistical rank of 11 15 while mayor binay has a statistical rank of 12 16
1341099 anong objective ng visit ng ating pangulo principally to attend the opening ceremonies of the 20th summer olympics bakit pupunta nag pangulo dahil iyung sports event or the olympics is a major international event she will be with 80 other heads of state
1341100 because they feel that iyung event na ito is something that convey the unity of the world around sports
1341101 the highest accolade you can give to the sports world is the presence of our president there
1341102 she will be holding a bilateral meeting with president hu jintao at pag usapan iyung mga current bilateral issues natin alam mo naman ang china is one of the biggest market now one of the most booming economies in the world and so the philippines must really take advantage of this opportunity for our products for the high consuming demand of china with more than one billion people
1341103 all of these are possibilities that if we miss out on that sayang ang opportunity kasi ang sinasabi ng iba naku magja junket lang ang pangulo hindi there is more beyond than just attending the opening and be there and see the colorful event of the opening theres a lot behind it investments and of course one of the biggest support we can give to our olympic team
1341104 neighboring country like china which is geopolitically as important in the whole gamut of our international relations as with the us
1341105 china is also a very major trading partner of the philippines people have to understand that this is part of the obligation of a head of state and a head of government such as president arroyo
1341106 this is my first birthday present these guys gave me the best present
1341107 they are perfectly the same as their daddy i am in heaven here i am a happy person
1341108 what is taught there is not sustainable what good is it for a farmer to have an education if he is not taught how to be sustainable
1341109 if i lived in this village for a year do you think i could learn how to make all these baskets
1341110 it is the responsibility of the democratic party to clean up our own backyard and such acts whether you determine them to be illegal or not should not be tolerated
1341111 i ask that you turn your immediate attention to this matter and request that you open an investigation with respect to this individual for the possibility of illegal activity
1341112 the state board of elections said we filed a valid petition
1341113 birds of a feather flock together but voters deserve more than just the same old politics that have divided local democrats for far too long
1341114 once again jack davis has shown he lacks the judgment to represent us in congress
1341115 i feel it is most appropriate for me to defend my post of vice president so that i can play a role in facilitating the transition of power
1341116 if i was seen as outspoken and firm in my criticism believe me it was never my intention to go against the leadership
1341117 the comments were made with transparency and sincerity because i want umno to remain strong empowered and credible
1341118 obviously wants to be a team player and does not want to disrupt the leadership transition plan
1341119 we are now retreating on that until we review the entire program especially the outside agencies that we send our children to
1341120 the committee felt they wanted to retreat and not make that a requirement
1341121 statistically you are not going to find these people volunteering more as adults
1341122 from our investigations the employer didnt breach any labor laws
1341123 it has been a policy in this country for quite a number of employers to keep the passports for safety reasons
1341124 we view this seriously unless and until we maintain an appearance that we are a conducive place to do such business our conditions of work and employment are meeting up to international standards then we might lose out in the long run
1341125 the government will do everything to ensure that we are internationally competitive
1341126 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1341127 if she would not have had that vision test i would never have known
1341128 im so relieved and going to make sure i do everything they tell me to make sure this works for her for life
1341129 how this lens is going to work in a childs eye we dont know weve never done studies
1341130 its an exciting thing in a patient who has had conventional therapy and failed
1341131 there is no doubt that the rising cost of fuel is tempting consumers to shop at home and the trend will probably be buoyed by their need to ensure they are getting value for money

1341137 we were born to manifest the glory of god that is within us its not in some of us its in everyone so why are we stuck on the thought that we are the leaders of tomorrow why not the leaders of today our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate our greatest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure

1341145 kayleigh you you know i am jealous so why do you keep rubbing it in some friend you are
1341146 youre only supposed to have one injury a day yesterday i had three
1341147 its a fantastic opportunity for us at a time when a lot of our competitors are scaling down because of difficulties accessing their balance sheet
1341148 last year many private equity players were clamouring for exposure in india and china but it was hard to get in
1341149 now sellers expectations have come down and what theyre asking for is much more reasonable but the private equity and hedge funds have really pulled back and are more cautious
1341150 i also dont know who is behind the sms which is definitely not started by pkr but it could be from irresponsible people who are out to take advantage of the situation
1341151 ive got the arc of the story figured out now its just a matter of pulling together the images that i want to illustrate it and making sure the transitions work the way that i want them to
1341152 the sentence itself is a story with a beginning a middle and an end something happens in a sentence
1341153 the true pursuit of library 2 0 involves a thorough recalibration of process policy physical spaces staffing and technology so that any hand offs in the patrons library experience are truly seamless
1341154 tools like blogs wikis and social bookmarks to deliver library resources and facilitate collaboration
1341155 no one reads war and peace its too long and not so interesting
1341156 no one except dweebs who dont realize that its too long and boring
1341157 shirky seems rather pleased to think of his opinions as sacrilegious but i suspect that at least a few readers will see them as a highbrow form of philistinism
1341158 learning is not to be found on a printout its not on call at the touch of the finger learning is acquired mainly from books and most readily from great books
1341159 look charles i gotta do this if i dont ill be nothing ill end up like my neighbor ricky smith he just sits around crocheting all day and snorting nasal spray
1341160 i suggest they wont find what they need in here like crazy fun and the happy hour
1341161 theres no alcohol here because its forbidden in the village its not the best nightlife of beijing
1341162 but the australian olympic committee has a big bowl out on the table and you can help yourself
1341163 until the competition is finished you tend to give people space
1341164 but therell be plenty of partying on the outside in the second week where theres an aussie theres a way to get drunk
1341165 is too many smiley and good behavior no tv and no frozen
1341166 my parents tell me when i was very very young i used to run around with a ribbon in my hand throw it up in the air then run out and do a cartwheel
1341167 i loved being in the gym and i loved being in my leotard i would never take it off and i would try and go to sleep in it when i fell asleep my parents would come into my room and take it off and id start crying as i wanted to sleep in my leotard
1341168 i look at her in complete awe as she does the most beautiful gymnastics ive seen

1341170 i really am truly excited for this year because ive been working for so many years and suddenly this is like the year
1341171 having my dad as my coach that helps as hes been there and hes done that he knows me personally better then anyone will ever know me
1341172 usually govt makes judgement on the basis of academic study
1341173 to save our economy from harm government needs to take some balancing strategy but it is difficult for a non political government to manage economy
1341174 asafa powell right beside me is the second fastest man in the world and tyson gay is the world champion and hes running really fast and hell be up there so its all about whos got the perfect race
1341175 if i get a good start i know im going to do well so its pretty much how i react in the finals
1341176 my game over the 200 has got very good over the years i think im maybe 95 percent there and one day ill get the perfect race
1341177 it would feel good to win any olympic gold but im definitely going out there hoping i win both
1341178 a world record can go at any time but olympic gold lasts forever
1341179 olympic gold is closer to my heart than anything if i run 19 98 and i win im going to be happy as long as i win im going to be happy
1341180 i knew i could i be a good competitor but i guess im faster than i thought
1341181 i know im clean so i pretty much just do what i do
1341182 i hope he gets better because if i want to be the best i have to beat the best
1341183 so tyson gay needs to be in that race so i can say im olympic champion 100 percent
1341184 our 70 000 members will now have direct access to professional data recovery at a reduced price
1341185 we realize that drivesavers engineers are experts at recovering data in the digital arts field and we appreciate the efficiency and timeliness that they can offer to our napp members
1341186 considering the present gas reserves of bangladesh and in the event that no further reserves are discovered then in a matter of years the gas will be exhausted diesel will be the only fuel to rely on it will be a daunting challenge for bangladesh to depend on diesel import so the government must look towards jatropha as an alternative source of fuel unfortunately our policymakers remain indecisive on the issue
1341187 the government will have to put a buy back system in place for the farmers
1341188 all over the world jatropha cultivation and production of its oil is being done on the basis of public private partnership
1341189 it is possible to grow 1300 plants per hectare so even if jatropha is planted on seven lac hectares of land a total of 37 lac metric tonnes of fuel could be produced annually
1341190 these trees produce fruit when two years old and live for 45 years so as fuel demands increase each year the trees grow too and produce more and more fruit this meets the increasing demand for fuel this is not possible from any other source
1341191 its been 37 years since independence and we are still confined to pilot projects when will we go for implementation the country wasnt made independent as a pilot project
1341192 not only will fuel be produced from jatropha it will have by products too this includes vegetable fat oil cakes and glycerin its cultivation will promote afforestation and environmental protection as well as generate employment all this will be possible if the government extends its cooperation
1341193 glory to god in the highest and on earth peace to people of good will
1341194 back in the 1970s icel was hijacked by heterodox bishops clergy and scholars that should be in quotes as no real latin scholar would claim those translations rs as a ploy to fix this mess we will claim that we are translating the new 2002 missale romanum even though the its latin is practically identical to the latin upon which the earlier translations were based
1341195 we would have to spend tk 17 000 crore in subsidies if we did not adjust the petroleum prices for the new fiscal
1341196 there is no doubt that it will have an impact on the transport sector
1341197 we calculated that the cost of fuel constitute only 32 to 40 percent of the entire cost in transport sector so the cost in this sector should increase only by 12 5 to 13 percent
1341198 the government however has to be very careful so the diesel subsidy for agriculture sector is duly implemented
1341199 our role in tourism is very important we work as a key player for tourists we work as a chain for example a tourist needs accommodation transport food and sight seeing and all these things are done by our tour operators
1341200 religion and culture wont be a barrier because the tourist who comes to bangladesh comes with that mindset he comes here to see our culture and different religious activities
1341201 we are now providing all the facilities to tourists we guide them on where to go and how to go and we provide transport services and so on for such information the tourist handbook published by the executive times has been very helpful

1341234 music has been a vital and vibrant part of sonys culture for over 20 years this acquisition will allow us to achieve a deeper and more robust integration between the wide ranging global assets of the music company and sonys products operating companies and affiliates

1341246 this was a disgraceful and criminal campaign aimed at intimidating candidates and voters and subverting the democratic process it is vital that david cameron takes action to determine why watford conservatives failed to investigate the matter properly and to ensure that such an appalling course of events is never repeated
1341247 to ensure that such obviously unsuitable individuals are no longer selected as conservative candidates

1341251 tasers are making a real difference on our streets not only keeping the public safe but also protecting our police officers
1341252 and if you look at the equipment we have seized it is clear to me the plan was to use these items for criminal purposes
1341253 we are very very worried about the intentions of a number of hardcore protesters which we believe are around 150 who are committed to using criminal means to achieve their aims
1341254 when i was younger i used to watch the track and field a lot but for me seeing agassi win gold was awesome
1341255 its an honour and a privilege to get this opportunity and hopefully i can replicate what he did when he won his gold medal
1341256 im feeling good all the worlds top players are going to be there but on my current form theres no reason why i cant challenge for a medal
1341257 its a big sacrifice but to be involved in the olympics is a rare opportunity
1341258 it was inappropriate he was lonely at the time and that was the only way he knew to communicate but he said he has learnt from that and he wont be doing that kind of thing again its a case of self policing for barry he now realises it is wrong
1341259 the external environment has deteriorated and the consequences of this for northern rock are increased credit losses
1341260 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership

1341272 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1341273 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1341274 there is no ps3 version of left 4 dead currently in production
1341275 if you mention a new half life people want to make as many versions of it as possible if left 4 dead is big then we may see a ps3 version later or if and when we do a sequel people may be more interested in that

1341294 events like this prove that there are some talented players out there and that young british asians want to play the game regularly and make it as professionals

1341296 if youve got a kid coming through with the same skill levels as someone like joe cole then no one will care about the colour of their skin because theyll want to sign them up as quickly as possible
1341297 integration is essential for asian kids if were serious about british asians making an impact in football over the next few years then theyve got to be out there and getting involved
1341298 communication is critical and its only now that were starting to see some effective engagement from premier league and championship clubs
1341299 we dont know how many asian youngsters are in their academies though and i imagine it cant be more than a handful asian kids must be moving through the system at an early age if theyre to stand a chance of making it to the top

1341301 its a fantastic experience for the asian select team to play at a proper league two ground and events like this are helping us move in the right direction

1341338 i think this is going to be a change election and i think people are looking to take the debate to a higher level
1341339 i think perhaps since the iraq war people want more out of these campaigns than just a sideshow
1341340 the reality is that you have to have somebody who is hard nosed i think udall is sweating for the first time in this campaign
1341341 wadhams is the kind of guy that if you have a border running across a lake hes running full throttle and at the last second turns his boat around right at the naval barricade

1341347 the many new distribution paths are causing an increase in the demand for music use rights
1341348 in view of this fact we believe that building a business for the management and exploitation of such rights in europe is an attractive proposition we want to take advantage of our opportunities and position ourselves with the strong well established bmg brand and a management that is highly regarded in the market

1341415 the abortion will terminate the life of a whole separate unique living human being
1341416 the fetus passes through the catheter and either dies in transit as its passing through the catheter or dies in the suction bottle after its all the way out
1341417 can the heart of a fetus or embryo still be beating during a suction curettage abortion as the fetus or embryo comes down the cannula
1341418 the physician will usually first notice a quantity of amniotic fluid followed by placenta and fetal parts which may be more or less identifiable
1341419 the procedure typically changes significantly at 21 weeks because the fetal tissues become much more cohesive and difficult to dismember
1341420 a long curved mayo scissors may be necessary to decapitate and dismember the fetus
1341421 the doctor grips a fetal part with the forceps and pulls it back through the cervix continuing to pull even after meeting resistance from the cervix the friction causes the fetus to tear apart for example a leg might be ripped off the fetus as it is pulled through the cervix and out of the woman the process of evacuating the fetus piece by piece continues until it has been completely removed
1341422 we would attack the lower part of the lower extremity first remove you know possibly a foot then the lower leg at the knee and then finally we get to the hip
1341423 its not unusual at the start of d amp e procedures that a limb is acquired first and that limb is brought through the cervix prior to the disarticulation and prior to anything having been done that would have caused fetal demise up to that point
1341424 when youre doing a dismemberment d amp e usually the last part to be removed is the skull itself and its floating free inside the uterine cavity so its rather like a ping pong ball floating around and the surgeon is using his forcep to reach up and to try to grasp something thats freely floating around and is quite large relative to the forcep were using so typically theres several misdirections misattempts to grasp finally at some point either the instruments are managed to be in place around the skull or a nip is made out of some area of the skull that allows it to start to decompress and then once that happens typically the skull is brought out in fragments rather than as a unified piece
1341425 this is what a prominent abortionist dr martin haskell said about an abortion done in the second trimester we would attack the lower part of the lower extremity first remove you know possibly a foot then the lower leg at the knee and then finally we get to the hip sir maam when you say the word abortion is this what you mean
1341426 dr haskell also says typically the skull is brought out in fragments rather than as a unified piece when you say abortion is this what you mean

1341441 i had emailed the most promising looking jujitsu club last week explaining what i was looking for and a little of my background training with jikishin i received an immediate reply from stephen chee sensei inviting me to join his dojo and make sure to bring my gi on sunday result turns out stephen chee sensei is a 6th dan jujitsuka affiliated to the world jujitsu federation which was developed by jitsu luminary prof robert clark in liverpool after warm up was sparring the rules were 1 no punching in the face 2 er thats it we rotated along the line swapping partners every 20 seconds and trying to work throws in i managed an inside hock counter to a roundhouse kick on one of the brown belts happy with that and then the next fellow attempted a cheeky hip throw i pushed him off and swept his leg he didnt go down but was certainly well off balance that was fun finally we repeated the 20 second sparring rotating line up but with groundwork this was interesting also and i have to say that practicing at seymours bjj infused groundwork sessions stood me in good stead i fought three blackbelts one orange belt and one brown drew the first four and submitted the last one so i was quite pleased with that the class was nearly over some warm down exercises brought things to a conclusion
1341442 last season was embarrassing for us and it wasnt nice
1341443 last year was a failure we didnt perform well and we finished right down the bottom of the table this year we have to improve and get back up the table where we should be going off last years finish it is not something to be proud of
1341444 finishing down there hurts it hurt me and the rest of the lads they feel that as much as i do last year we had to turn it around and eventually we put a run together it will be another tough year because every club is improving everyone is throwing money at it and getting better buying better players we have to keep up with that if you stand still you can go backwards
1341445 we showed against real madrid that ade and i have a few nice combinations together
1341446 i think any of the top four can win the title i am not going to say we are going to win it because you never know they do not know we do not know either but i hope we can do it i am committed to win it and if you look around so is everyone here
1341447 they want to make sure their children and grandchildren know there are certain values they want to pass along with their legacy such as education and hard work
1341448 and a c at harvard isnt the same as a c at a community college
1341449 the purpose is to allow the children to all live in the same neighborhood
1341450 the kids who work for charities can live on the same streets as their doctor and lawyer siblings
1341451 if youre home raising a family were not going to deny you the trust payments
1341452 you want beneficiaries to have a voice but not a controlling voice because they will inevitably want to increase the amount of money paid out of the trust to them
1341453 leave enough flexibility so youre not ruling from the grave
1341454 err on the side of giving the money to them anyway
1341455 i tell them to think about what values they want their kids and grandkids to have typically work ethic and responsible management of money
1341456 i heard on the radio today that the soul put an end to the philly curse
1341457 i doubt well get rooney fit for the start of the season with the virus hes had
1341458 its a virus he picked up in nigeria and its not a nice one but quite a few have had it
1341459 its such a bad virus and hes got to be training to be fit
1341460 i dont know whether we will have a team ready nani is suspended anderson is in the olympic games
1341461 michael carricks come in this morning and he may play a part of the game on sunday
1341462 i was 80 certain that i would do the double but after hearing what my coach has been saying now i am 100 certain
1341463 i have been conditioning myself all year in case i plan to run the double i have been doing 200m and 100m over the season i am used to the heats i dont think it will take too much out of me
1341464 there are definitely more opponents i have asafa powell right beside me who is the second fastest man in the world
1341465 tyson gay is world champion and he is running fast it just depends who has the perfect race
1341466 in the 200m you have got walter dix and a lot of runners so you know you need to be on top of your game
1341467 partially olympic gold is always good and i am doing well in both but the 200m is closer to my heart
1341468 scott now has a number of first grade appearances under his belt and is continuing to develop
1341469 there will always be speculation about good players and vedran is a very good player
1341470 everything we do is about trying to achieve a medal at the olympics
1341471 although last year was the first year i ran the 10 000m i was frustrated to just miss out on a medal at the world championships
1341472 but that experience gave me the motivation to keep training hard and go that one step better in beijing
1341473 i am really excited about it and i think the experience of osaka will stand me in good stead the 10 000 is what i have focused all my training on
1341474 the race at the world championships came down to who could handle the heat best it was over 37 degrees and there was really high humidity
1341475 it became more of a slog who could last out that was an unusual situation for a championship but i think beijing will be the same
1341476 the ethiopians have been the ones to watch for a number of years they have set the world records in recent times they have fast finishes and are very difficult to beat
1341477 but you need to think about your strategies rather just than the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition how can you prepare to deal with the conditions and use that to your advantage
1341478 as far as bill is concerned the club has been for sale for the last five years this is nothing new
1341479 bill has always said that he would sell the club if the right people with the right finance came along
1341480 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1341481 it is not just a new face we need it is new faces my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably will not be ready to start the premier league season its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle
1341482 i am hoping we will have some in before the start of the season but i am not going to turn around and say i am totally confident because you never know what happens but yes i am hoping that we will end up getting a few in
1341483 he let us know in no uncertain terms that the season is only two weeks away he told us that we had to stop feeling sorry for ourselves stop thinking about who we are going to bring in stop thinking about everything else that is going on and to just get on with playing football
1341484 we do have a very strong team better financed and better resourced than ever and i believe this will deliver the goods and we will move significantly forward from 10th
1341485 for a number of sports we also want to see real progress towards 2012
1341486 we are confident we will move forward from 10th but it would be unwise to speculate how close we will get to fourth
1341487 at athens the combined margin of five british golds being silver medals was only 0 545sec that shows how close it can be
1341488 the target of 35 medals and eighth place in the medals table remains the same we do have a stretch target of 41 medals that we would hope to achieve if everything goes right and that also remains the same
1341489 i do not anticipate the boa changing the by law at all
1341490 what we need to do is look at the appeal mechanism
1341491 the rest of the world is looking at what we do and a number are considering having similar eligibility rules
1341492 ultimately the reason we have the by law is that it is asked for by the athletes we carry out a poll after every games and there has never been less than 90 supporting it
1341493 rafael van der vaart is the first and possibly the only signing of the summer for real madrid
1341494 we believe that this squad is full of quality of plenty of talent its a team which is a great family very close
1341495 we said that the new arrivals would be few but of great quality that seemed logical after two successful seasons in which weve brought in 19 young promising players
1341496 this the low number of signings was a request of the board of directors
1341497 ronaldo is a fantastic player one of the best in the world
1341498 if he came it would be great of course but out of respect i cant say anything more about this matter
1341499 all the players here are great players so therell be no problems
1341500 i can play in different positions but its up to the coach to decide who plays
1341501 i can play behind the forward or on the left hand side of the attack so theres plenty of options
1341502 im very excited to be here my family are especially excited because they are from spain
1341503 i think that this is one of the biggest clubs in the world so im very happy
1341504 last year valencia wanted me and they are a fantastic club but this year things are different and madrid have come for me
1341505 ive been in contact with wesley its been very difficult for him
1341506 these things happen sometimes in football it was a shame because he was very down and i was very happy about signing
1341507 the days are going by and the market is closing
1341508 if there is a decision the best thing would be for it to be made before the champions league qualifiers august 12 13
1341509 were in the process of looking at how everyone reacts above all how pep is with the group and with the player
1341510 he silva is an interesting good player not only for us but also for teams in other countries too
1341511 if cas rule in our favour we want for our fans the player to be with his club
1341512 we respected the decision of fifa but if cas say the opposite to them the club will make sure he messi is with us
1341513 im over the moon it was up in the air last year but i just needed to get my head around things knuckle down and get on with it
1341514 physically ive come on leaps ive put in all the hard work and have been rewarded with this contract
1341515 its great news for the club craigs a local bradford lad whos really developed physically has got very good skills and in particularly over these last six months really come on massively
1341516 the giddily bullish market for the services of the worlds leading soccer players
1341517 the world economy may be slowing but you wouldnt know it to look at the giddily bullish market for the services of the worlds leading soccer players
1341518 if the global economic slowdown eats into ticket and merchandising sales and the credit crunch suddenly trims the money available even to top clubs the transfer market may see something of a correction a development that could make middling leagues more competitive and heaven help clubs boosted by vanity investment if their benefactors were to suddenly walk away even before this summers spending is added chelsea would have just 18 months to repay abramovich more than 1 billion if the russian moved on to a different hobby
1341519 i started the conversation in response to the reverend jesse jacksons vulgar comments about barack obama i used the same offensive word that reverend jackson used not as a slur towards any one individual or race rather i used it and other offensive words as a linguistic devise a provocation to generate attention for this conversation about race relations it worked i come to you tonight not to defend my 1st amendment rights because they have not been violated i do not come to criticize those who would silence me because they have the same unalienable right to condemn my speech as i have to utter it nor do i come to apologize i did what i did intentionally and with a purpose it worked better than i counted on i baited my critics to generate attention to the conversation that i believe needs to be had they reacted predictably i make no apology for manipulating them because to do so would dishonor them i have no delusions about being a puppeteer each of us has choices we are responsible for our own actions and reactions nor do i apologize to my friends and affiliates that my critics have tried to paint as racist by association their reactions and responses are an important part of this conversation
1341520 the international community has pledged 8bn 4bn to the palestinian authority in the west bank and that gives them a heavy responsibility to make sure the security forces dont use torture and respect human rights
1341521 gordon brown announced a multimillion pound increase in aid to the pa security forces during his visit to the region last week
1341522 the evidence is mounting that top us officials including president george bush vice president dick cheney and former defence secretary donald rumsfeld committed war crimes by authorising the use of
1341523 if if was a fifth id probably be a pro bowler im not going to get into that if stuff
1341524 what cause will i take up or what significance will my life make
1341525 this is the first time ive ever formally met him beside some talk with him on the ice
1341526 sometimes theres a little chirping its nice to finally put a face to a guy on the ice and see how they are
1341527 were in the same division out there whl so it was something i had to deal with on a regular basis hes a big guy physical i know hes a defenseman but hes an offensive guy too youve got to be really aware of him when hes on the ice especially on the power play with that big shot
1341528 earlier in the season i was in front of the net on the penalty kill and he was back at the blue line and my job basically was to block his shot
1341529 i came out and took the shot off the inside of the arm so i teased him a little about that the other day said his shot wasnt too hard
1341530 i talked to his coach at moose jaw dave hunchak and he told me that travis missed a month of the season with a broken jaw but actually finished the game in which he suffered the injury
1341531 makes great decisions with the puck doesnt do anything stupid just a good defensive defenseman
1341532 i think the thing with me and jyri is were both western league boys
1341533 hes a european but he came over and adapted very well the big thing with us is i skate very well and so does he hes got a little more offensive punch to the game but me on the other hand im more of a defensive shut down kind of guy when you have a guy thats pretty good offensively he complements well with a defensive guy and you kind of that trust that he can go and ill be there to cover him up
1341534 sonny has joined us for one season with the option of another season
1341535 he has confirmed his complete desire to finish with rugby league to switch over to union i cant see him going back to league that seems to be a closed chapter in his career
1341536 what we are keen to do if we can is ensure that no such contract is entered into
1341537 we have come to the court as soon as we could in order to protect the rights of the bulldogs
1341538 it is difficult to quantify what loss will be suffered
1341539 our problem is is williams under contract with another rugby union side the answer is no
1341540 therefore hes free to join with whoever he wants he doesnt need a letter to leave
1341541 we asked the question yesterday and we didnt really get an answer to that
1341542 it was gone this morning and it didnt really have any adverse effect yesterday so as long as its gone thats good
1341543 i dont know how i would go running the marathon a week later
1341544 made all the precautions that we can to assist our swimmers
1341545 the fact that it didnt affect anybody yesterday and its cleared up this morning it hasnt become an issue
1341546 if people were coughing and spluttering all over the place thats when it would be a concern but at this stage nothing like that has taken place
1341547 but we have eight gold medals among the reserves that werent selected
1341548 for me knowing how strong the people who havent been selected are makes me feel as though im certainly worthy of being here and i know all five of us have won a four star competition the highest level of equestrian competition somewhere in the world
1341549 an 18 year old who is talented at cricket and a football code can now look at the ipl champions twenty20 league the big bash tournament in whatever form it is in and an olympic gold medal as well as the pinnacle representing your country in test cricket and stay in the game its appealing for five reasons
1341550 often players have felt they havent had as big an input into administrative decisions so its a great time for the administrators and the players to get together and work towards it if everyone believes in it
1341551 the players ive spoken to believe in it and theyd love to be part of some sort of push to get in there and at least present our case
1341552 whats the big deal about having such advancements about products in swimming
1341553 there isnt a big deal in other sports we wanted to see michael jordan jump higher in his day we want to see roger federer play better tennis we want to see lance armstrong on a better bike in his heyday
1341554 its just part of the evolution of sport its part of the process if we were staying in the same swimsuits and same sort of competition wear i think it would get a little bit boring
1341555 i think its exciting and its no different to any other sport and im in a position where i have a world record and it would never worry me if it got broken because someone wore a suit its part of spectator sport its enjoyable to watch and its very exciting
1341556 i think the amount of focus that has been placed on the swimsuits has taken away from the performances of the athletes and i hope that we can look at this weeks performances and really applaud the performances and not look for other reasons
1341557 swimsuit technology advancement is something we have been doing since we wore full length woollen suits in 1908 so in my opinion its nothing new
1341558 if we didnt have advancement and didnt have forward thinking people we wouldnt be where we are now and i think the aim of the game is to break world records and i think thats what we all enjoy seeing and what we come to watch and thats what our sport is about
1341559 we want to see people swim fast we want to see what the boundaries are and we want to take them as far as we can within the rules of the game
1341560 its my understanding that park said he is going to swim under the world record and if he intends to do that hell get a very good result
1341561 the reason its been such a good world record is because it was set by ian thorpe who is a phenomenal swimmer and its a tough record and i think were still a little bit away from it but well just have to see what will happen
1341562 park is a very good competitor hes a current world champion and im looking forward to racing him and giving him a good race as will the other six competitors in that field
1341563 i guess a lot of the focus is on the 1500m freestyle for me but another good event for me is the 400m and i feel like things are going pretty well
1341564 i dont know of any legal authority to deny public access but the commission asked the attorneys to come back and look for legal authority to support their position and well consider it
1341565 we saw a bulletin on morning news with several photos of a mr

1341573 its precautionary were blessed to be able to give them another week of recovery but both could have played if we needed them
1341574 we will see what happens on the field in terms of when we can use them off the bench but we know they are ready
1341575 the final guide we have this year is to think of them in an e10 context that doesnt mean it wont change but this fall they wont be able to blow each others heads off
1341576 we think its really important that these things can scale between in game and out of game and how we can use them on the web
1341577 the next couple of poses will help you get to grips with the current one
1341578 were not going to rush them wherever we feel theyre going to develop best is where theyre going to be placed the next year its about patience
1341579 i think hes going to have an opportunity to make the islanders and continue to do what he has
1341580 hes tremendously talented hes going to be given the opportunity to develop his game to the next level remember that hes still going to be in his first year of pro hockey but just develop and learn the pro game
1341581 he brings as tremendous work ethic and hes got tremendous skill
1341582 he just has to get bigger and stronger hes going to play a full season in sweden which is good for both our side and his side hes going to be in a good program where he can strengthen himself and play at an elite level we have him signed to a contract and he remains one of our top prospects hes proven himself in north america in the last two years in the whl we know he has what it takes to be a good player
1341583 we thought he had a solid year at denver he has to get bigger and stronger he plays a robust fearless type of game but he does bring other skills the style of game he plays he has to get a little stronger add some weight and beef to his frame
1341584 hes going to be fighting for a spot and its up to ben to take the bull right off the get go and prove that he belongs
1341585 hes a very versatile player hes got tremendous hockey sense he just has to prove it consistently at the next level but we still have a lot of interest and hope that he can fill that role for us
1341586 hes probably going to need a little bit more time but hes got nhl skills nhl ability and a talent level were excited about
1341587 hopefully he can come into training camp and dazzle us
1341588 wed like him to have a strong year in bridgeport
1341589 if he comes to camp and wows us and shows us hes nhl ready hell play there but we think hed really benefit from one year in the ahl
1341590 that size that he has is something we dont have a lot of at any forward positions with any of our prospects
1341591 a strong year in bridgeport is going to help develop him and give him some confidence in north america
1341592 hes a player that has to get a little bit better at everything he plays like a pro like any young 20 year old hes still getting better at everything theres not one thing he has to improve upon its just fine tuning
1341593 were thrilled with how he became a leader last year
1341594 he was a captain in the second half and its something we want him to build on learning the pro game is a big step for him hes 6 4 but he has to be able to put on weight hes 187 now we like a lot of his qualities to be a player at the next level
1341595 hes a center who makes other people around him better the type of center we need in our system he has great offensive instincts and he can make things happen with his superior vision character and leadership
1341596 hes got tremendous playmaking abilities his vision his ability to make plays play any situation power play penalty kill 5 on 5 thats something we were really looking for we see him as a top six forward a guy that is going to lead our offense and play with kyle okposo
1341597 well see how his summer is and how pro ready he is in the fall
1341598 its going to be difficult for him going into boston university next year the biggest thing for corey is he has to get bigger and stronger he more than anyone else we drafted has to add strength hes got a good frame to grow into the message were going to give to corey is to go there and be a sponge develop your game but bring the offense you have and be confident in your own abilities
1341599 hes tied to kazan and thats great because hes going to be play at a high level of hockey and develop his game when he feels he can come to the nhl well be ready for him
1341600 were going to read and react its a sticky situation with the russians but i think were going to play off what happens over there im not sure whats going to happen
1341601 hes a tremendous skater he moves the puck very well he had a tough year with both shoulders being injured it slowed down his development last year but hes built for the new game his skating his puck skills his ability to move the puck and run the power play hes bringing an offensive threat
1341602 when you draft a kid out of minnesota high schools youre unsure how hell be at the next level
1341603 with his skating and skills its been easy for him hes had to prove himself and the under 18 level which he has but now its learning to play against bigger stronger players
1341604 he plays an energetic game and has a long legged type skating style to go along with the willingness to play physical
1341605 we dont have a ton of size on our back end
1341606 and the one thing travis and jyri bring is some size
1341607 last year he split duties in the first half and really took over the in second half
1341608 now hes going to have to prove to us he can do that over a full year and prove he can be a solid no 1 goalie for his club next year
1341609 stefan didnt play a lot last year but thats the way it is for a 19 year old kid in sweden
1341610 he needs to play games practice at the elite league level is nice but its not the same as playing games he really needs to play games develop technique and work on game situations
1341611 i am going to lead our nation to energy independence and im going to do it with a realistic and comprehensive all of the above approach that uses every resource available to finally solve this crisis
1341612 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face

1341619 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security

1341636 the country is fascinated with black and white but what about brown
1341637 its underestimated undervalued and it has the power to decide the election our vote counts the same as their vote
1341638 my message is that i personally am for barack obama and if you are thats great but more importantly it should be a fair election and people should vote
1341639 too many states are decided not by the people that turn out but by the people that dont turn out the fact that more people vote for american idol than for president of the united states is just incredibly wrong

1341650 weve been here about ten years and we put gravel in it and put gravel in it and put gravel in it we probably could have paved it with all the money we put in gravel
1341651 when they plow the snow they push it to the end of the parking lot and you wouldnt believe how much gravel they scrape up theres hardly any left
1341652 it will just dress the place up and make it look better more presentable
1341653 most of the problem is this time of year when its dry and dusty especially with a limestone parking lot you can see the dust fly and we might receive neighbor complaints
1341654 he couldnt tell tarika had a child in her arms

1341657 everyone in the show is like family and sometimes we dont see each other all year until the minstrel
1341658 its kind of like coming back to your family every year
1341659 singing is our hobby something we do together as a husband and wife and we really enjoy it
1341660 there arent many opportunities to sing in front of a big crowd in our area
1341661 i dont think it is very family appropriate but it is a fun song to sing
1341662 it takes a lot of courage to get up there and sing in front of three judges looking you up and down
1341663 it is a lot easier to sing during the show when the audience is faceless
1341664 it might date some people but we have such a variety of ages that perform we thought it would make a great variety show
1341665 last year we had the 50th anniversary and we decided to bury those 50 years and move on
1341666 anytime you have a change like this you have to be concerned and on alert to the opportunities and the threats

1341668 i am pleased and excited for our employees and our customers to have reached this agreement with genesee amp wyoming
1341669 it was an important factor to be acquired by a company who embraces its employees and customers as we have over the last 22 years
1341670 it was equally important that the new owner also have the proven ability to invest the necessary capital for our systems continued growth
1341671 this is a win win situation the land is within city limits and its located directly across the street from the ohio central railroads headquarters on papermill road
1341672 it belongs to them and they have the right to do that
1341673 the sales tax report may be a little bright spot were seeing the affects of the stimulus tax payments were up about 4 percent more than last years the price of gas may benefit our county because more and more people are not going out of town theyre shopping locally

1341679 its important for all of our educators to be trained in the special needs of all of our students
1341680 i know that every penny will be used for exactly that very purpose
1341681 we call it the competence and collaboration in teaching students with disabilities grant its our own title because it captures what were trying to do
1341682 when they say ohio is small business friendly its a joke

1341689 aufgrund der vielen anfragen besch ftigen wir uns nun schon einige zeit mit dem thema zensur in china
1341690 wir werden versuchen den reportern und sportlern in china technische hilfe anzubieten

1341702 nichts dagegen zu unternehmen ist einfach nur l cherlich das ist genauso schlimm wie der betrug mit doping

1341708 the impact of the affair kerviel is mostly behind us
1341709 alabama was one of the first teams with several players white eyelet placket and tongue didnt last long
1341710 but he signed with them in 1915 and his last season with them was 1920
1341711 yknow like an asg or a japan tour but i did a double take the first time i saw it thinking maybe the reds had worn red shoes for an opener at riverfont or something but after looking at it i realized it was posed its too perfect the ump for instance also the only 24 pirates had in 71 was a pitcher named john lamb unless he was pinch running hed probably have been wearing a jacket but it is 1971 note the button front reds jersey well before the team allowed anything but plain black shoes so it appears concepcion who later wore red shoes and white shoes in asgs decided to show how great the reds unis would look if they wore those new red adidas the white sox and phillies were introducing that year and he was right
1341712 its so repulsive and tacky that i had to send it your way
1341713 driving to work this morning i was listening to am 750 wsb which is atlantas biggest bews talk station and until recently was the braves radio flagship they were talking about longtime braves announcer skip caray who died on sunday apparently the host of the show mark arum suggested that the braves retire the number 17 to honor skip and all of the old announcers who used to broadcast all of the games on tbs when it was known as channel 17 the remarks were then relayed to the braves announcing crew doing the game on the west coast for peachtree tv and they talked about it during the broadcast and thought it was a great idea how weird is that im not sure if they would really ever do it or more importantly if they should kinda doesnt seem right to have the 17 up on the outfield wall with numbers of the great braves of the past and jackie robinson it just made me wonder if there were other instances of teams retiring numbers for such abstract things as tv stations
1341714 the 1970s pirates appear to be a bottomless pit of ricko fodder the latest exhibits willie stargell wearing white shoes in the 1978 all star game an awesome ad for brookes spikes and a montage of virtually every possible combo from the bumblebee era
1341715 17 would be appropriate given that ted turner once had andy messersmith take the field with the word
1341716 makes sense to me cause when i see the team running on and off the field in those hats it makes me seasick
1341717 the only race that matters is the race to beat out a ground ball the only colors that matter are the away grays and home whites its that simple in baseball there is nothing more to it

1341753 my book says our warming is natural unstoppable and not very dangerous anyway
1341754 these books represent the two leading explanations for the earths recent temperature changes and they conflict if global warming truly is the most important public policy issue of our day then it is high time the public got to hear the arguments from both sides matched up against each other

1341758 standing outside the firehouse with my buddies we were talking about how beautiful the day was then just like that our lives changed forever some of those guys i would never see again
1341759 we first assembled on west street where we saw someone burnt beyond recognition we were like what is going on here and then went straight into the marriot building
1341760 it looked like a bomb went off and we started making our way up the stairs to rescue as many people as we could
1341761 the elevators just blew right out we couldnt believe it the plane hits 80 floors up but the elevators explode at least five minutes later it was unreal
1341762 we were tossed like a rag doll by another explosion in our building people were making there way down the stairwells burnt like you couldnt believe we were all shocked because it seemed as if there was fire everywhere on so many floors it just didnt make sense
1341763 the lobby was like a war zone we could not find our way out then all of a sudden one of the maintenance workers had a key that opened a back door that got us out of there he saved my life
1341764 i want to thank him from the bottom of my heart
1341765 we havent been treated properly at all from the day of the attack our physical and mental health has deteriorated and it seems as if no one cares to lose friends to have to recover their bodies in the days after to be offered no protections against that horrific smelling dust that was everywhere even though the government said the air was ok to breathe is just not right
1341766 i stayed right here and did the right thing and now it feels as if im suffering the most where is our government to help the ones with the toughest jobs on that day and the days after

1341813 csps service and systems integration business reported solid results in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 while the systems business continues to be affected by the shifting of military priorities away from strategic programs
1341814 our year over year comparisons are challenged for the three and nine month periods as we reported a significant amount of systems revenue in fiscal 2007 from a major supply contract with raytheon
1341815 in fiscal 2008 we are recording systems revenue from a number of small multicomputer contracts in contrast to the large contract we were awarded last year in addition contracts that previously had been delayed and were expected to result in revenue in the second half of fiscal 2008 have now been pushed out to fiscal 2009 as a result we now expect that revenues for the second half of fiscal 2008 from our systems business will approximate those from the first half of the year
1341816 during the fourth quarter our systems business will introduce a hybrid computing platform through our previously announced partnership with annapolis micro systems
1341817 the new platform will include annapolis innovative design and development tools on a field programmable gate array fpga integrated chip within our fastcluster rugged computing platform this hybrid fastcluster computing environment is capable of supporting hundreds of hybrid compute blades and includes a broad set of libraries diagnostics and development tools that promote collaboration productivity and portability we are excited to be offering a high quality hybrid computing solution to military and commercial customers
1341818 csps service and systems integration business continued to perform well across each of its subsidiaries in the third quarter
1341819 our german subsidiary is capitalizing on demand for its professional service practices including lifecycle management archiving and network migration and security in the united states our systems and solutions division ssd which provides it infrastructure solutions is leveraging an expanded sales force to generate excellent sales growth we also are pleased with our u k subsidiary which reported another profitable quarter
1341820 as we head into the final quarter of fiscal 2008 we remain cautiously optimistic about the demand environment and the opportunities we are seeing at our service and systems integration business however we are keeping a watchful eye for any changes in the economies of the countries in which we operate we are focused on continuing to grow this business organically as well as through strategic acquisitions that would provide complementary technical or geographic practices
1341821 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s

1341859 ambillah zakat dari sebagian harta mereka dengan zakat itu kamu membersihkan dan mensucikan mereka
1341860 dan pada harta mereka ada hak untuk orang miskin yang meminta dan orang miskin yang tidak mendapat bagian
1341861 yaitu orang orang yang jika kami teguhkan kedudukan mereka di muka bumi niscaya mereka mendirikan shalat dan menunaikan zakat
1341862 tiga perkara yang aku bersumpah atas tiga perkara tersebut dan menceritakan kepada kalian maka jagalah tidak akan berkurang harta yang dishodaqohkan dan tidak seorang hamba dianiaya dengan satu kedholiman kemudian dia bersabar atas kedholiman kecuali allah akan menambahkan baginya dengan kemuliaan dan tidaklah seorang hamba membuka pintu meminta minta kecuali allah akan membaginya pintu kefakiran
1341863 dan orang orang yang menyimpan emas dan perak dan tidak menafkahkannya pada jalan allah maka beritahukanlah kepada mereka bahwa mereka akan mendapat siksa yang pedih
1341864 sekali sekali janganlah orang yang bakhil dengan harta yang allah berikan kepada mereka dari karunianya menyangka bahwa kebakhilan itu baik bagi mereka sebenarnya kebakhilan itu adalah buruk bagi mereka harta yang mereka bakhilkan itu kelak akan dikalungkan di lehernya di hari kiamat
1341865 tidaklah seseorang yang memiliki emas atau perak kemudian tidak ditunaikan haknya apabila datang hari kiamat dibentangkan baginya batu batu yang lebar dari neraka kemudian dia akan dipanggang di atas batu batu itu di dalam neraka jahannam kemudian disetrika perut dahi dan punggungnya setiap kali sudah dingin maka akan dikembalikan seperti semula yang satu hari adalah sama dengan 50 000 tahun sampai diputuskan perkaranya diantara manusia maka dia akan melihat jalannya apakah ke surga atau neraka
1341866 barang siapa yang allah telah berikan harta kepadanya kemudian dia tidak menunaikan zakatnya maka pada hari kiamat nanti hartanya akan berujud ular yang botak yang mempunyai dua titik hitam diatas kepalanya yang mengalunginya kemudian mengambil dengan kedua sisi mulutnya sambil berkata
1341867 sekali kali janganlah orang orang yang bakhil dengan harta yang telah allah berikan kepada mereka dari karunianya menyangka bahwa kebakhilan itu baik bagi mereka sebenarnya bahwa kebakhilan itu adalah buruk bagi mereka harta harta yang mereka bakhilkan itu akan dikalungkan di lehernya kelak di hari kiamat
1341868 dan barang siapa yang tidak mau menunaikannya zakat maka kami akan mengambilnya dan separuh hartanya adalah hak dari hak hak wajib bagi tuhan kami tidak halal bagi keluarga muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam darinya sedikitpun
1341869 aku telah diperintahkan untuk memerangi manusia supaya mereka bersaksi bahwa tidak ada tuhan yang berhak disembah selain allah dan bersaksi bahwa muhammad adalah utusan allah mereka menegakkan sholat dan menunaikan zakat maka kalau mereka telah mengerjakannya terjagalah dari darah dan harta mereka kecuali haknya islam dan hisab mereka di sisi allah
1341870 barang siapa yang mengingkari karena jahil tidak tahu atau dia termasuk orang yang tidak tahu karena baru masuk islam atau dia tinggal di daerah terpencil yang jauh dari daerah yang mengetahui akan wajibnya maka tidak dikafirkan adapun kalau dia seorang muslim yang tinggal di negeri islam di tengah tengah ahli ilmu maka hukumnya murtad
1341871 disandarkan shodaqoh kepada fithr berbuka disebabkan karena wajibnya untuk berbuka dari bulan ramadhan
1341872 yang dimaksud zakat fitrah adalah zakat jiwa istilah itu di ambil dari kata fitrah yang merupakan asal dari kejadian
1341873 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam telah mewajibkan zakat fithr fitrah satu sha dari kurma atau satu sha dari gandum kepada budak atau yang merdeka laki laki atau perempuan anak kecil ataupun dewasa dari kaum muslimin dan beliau menyuruh untuk dibayar sebelum manusia keluar untuk shalat ied
1341874 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mewajibkan zakat fitri kepada manusia pada bulan ramadhan
1341875 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam memerintahkan kami dengan shadaqah fitri sebelum diturunkannya kewajiban zakat dan tatkala diturunkan kewajiban zakat beliau tidak memerintahkan kami dan tidak pula melarang kami tapi kami mengerjakannya mengeluarkan zakat fitri
1341876 bahwa pada sanadnya ada seorang periwayat yang tidak dikenal akan tetapi hadits tersebut memiliki penguat dan dikeluarkan oleh an nasaai 5 49 dan ibnu majah 1 585 dan ahmad 6 6 dan ibnu khuzaimah 4 81 dan al hakim 1 410 dan al baihaqi 4 159 dari beberapa jalan dan sanadnya shahih
1341877 ini tidak menunjukkan hilangnya kewajiban zakat fitrah tapi hanya menunjukkan tambahan dalam jenis ibadah tidak mengharuskan dimansukhnya hukum sebelumnya namun zakat harta tempat zakat fithr berkaitan dengan riqah orang per orang
1341878 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mewajibkan zakat fithr sebanyak satu shaa korma atau satu shaa gandum atas hamba dan orang merdeka kecil dan besar dari kalangan muslimin
1341879 tidak wajib atas orang puasa karena hadits ibnu abbas radhiallahu anhuma
1341880 zakat fitri wajib juga atas orang puasa yang kaya atau fakir yang mendapatkannya dari makanan dia jika illat alasan pent diwajibkannya karena pensucian seluruh yang puasa butuh akan itu jika berserikat dalam illat berserikat juga dalam hukum
1341881 penyebutan pensucian disebutkan untuk menghukumi yang dominan zakat fithr diwajibkan pula atas orang yang tidak berpuasa berdosa seperti yang diketahui keshalihannya atau orang yang masuk islam sesaat sebelum terbenamnya matahari
1341882 kami mengeluarkan zakat pada zaman rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam satu shaa makanan satu shaa gandum satu shaa korma satu shaa susu kering satu shaa anggur kering
1341883 rasulullah menyuruh kami mengeluarkan zakat dari anak kecil besar budak dan merdeka barangsiapa yang belum jadi akan menjawab
1341884 zakat fithr satu shaa makanan barangsiapa yang membawa gandum diterima yang membawa korma diterima yang membawa salt diterima yang membawa anggur kering diterima aku kira beliau berkata pula yang membawa adonan diterima
1341885 tunaikanlah satu shaa gandum atau korma untuk dua orang satu shaa dari gandum atas orang merdeka hamba kecil atau besar
1341886 kami diperintahkan oleh rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mengeluarkan shadaqah fitri atas anak kecil dan orang tua orang merdeka dan seorang hamba dari orang orang yang membekalinya
1341887 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam telah mewajibkan zakat fitri sebagai pembersih diri bagi yang berpuasa dari perbuatan sia sia dan perbuatan kotor dan sebagi makanan bagi orang orang miskin
1341888 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mengkhabarkan kepada aku agar aku menjaga zakat ramadhan
1341889 apabila petugas telah duduk bertugas aku katakan kapankah petugas itu mulai bertugas beliau menjawab satu hari atau dua hari sebelum iedul fitri
1341890 ied dan tidak boleh diakhirkan setelah shalat atau dimajukan penunaiannya kecuali satu hari atau dua hari sebelum ied berdasarkan riwayat perbuatan ibnu umar radhiallahu anhu berdasarkan kaidah rawi hadits diketahui dengan makna riawayat dan apabila penunaian zakat itu diakhirkan setelah shalat maka zakat tu berubah menjadi suatu shadaqah dari beberapa jenis shadaqah berdasarkan hadits ibnu abbas radhiallahu anhuma
1341891 yet o lord you are our father we are the clay you are the potter we are all the work of your hand
1341892 may i never boast except in the cross of our lord jesus christ through which the world has been crucified to me and i to the world
1341893 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam biasa berbuka dengan ruthab kurma muda sebelum shalat jika tidak ada ruthab maka beliau berbuka dengan kurma jika tidak ada kurma beliau minum dengan satu tegukan air
1341894 barangsiapa memberi makan seorang yang berpuasa ia mendapatkan pahala seperti orang yang berpuasa tanpa mengurangi sedikitpun pahalanya
1341895 selalu manusia itu berada dalam kebaikan selama mereka menyegerakan berbuka
1341896 umatku akan terus dalam sunnahku selama mereka tidak menunggu bintang ketika berbuka puasa
1341897 agama ini akan terus jaya selama menyegerakan buka karena orang yahudi dan nashara mengakhirkannya
1341898 sesungguhnya allah memiliki hamba hamba yang dibebaskan dari neraka setiap siang dan malam dalam bulan ramadhan dan semua orang muslim yang berdoa akan dikabulkan doanya
1341899 ambillah zakat dari sebagian harta mereka dengan zakat itu kamu membersihkan dan mensucikan mereka
1341900 dan barang apa saja yang kamu nafkahkan maka allah akan menggantinya
1341901 bahwa zainab namanya adalah barroh maka dikatakan dia memuji dirinya maka rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menamainya zainab
1341902 dan kami menghendaki supaya tuhan mereka mengganti mereka dengan anak lain yang lebih baik kesuciannya dari anaknya itu
1341903 memberikan sebagian dari harta yang sejenis yang sudah sampai nashob selama setahun dan diberikan kepada orang fakir dan semisalnya yang bukan dari bani hasyim dan bani mutholib
1341904 memberikan bagian tertentu dari harta yang berkembang jika sudah sampai nishob untuk keperluan tertentu
1341905 hak wajib dari harta tertentu untuk golongan tertentu pada waktu tertentu
1341906 dan dirikanlah sholat tunaikanlah zakat dan rukulah beserta orang orang yang ruku
1341907 hai orang orang yang beriman nafkahkanlah di jalan allah sebagian dari hasil usahamu yang baik baik dan sebagian dari apa yang kami keluarkan dari bumi untuk kamu
1341908 dan mereka bertanya kepadamu apa yang mereka nafkahkan katakanlah yang lebih dari keperluan
1341909 padahal mereka tidak disuruh kecuali supaya menyembah allah dengan memurnikan ketaatan kepadanya dalam menjalankan agama dengan lurus dan supaya mereka mendirikan shalat dan menunaikan zakat dan yang demikian itulah agama yang lurus
1341910 islam dibangun di atas lima dasar bersaksi bahwa tidak ada sembahan yang berhak disembah kecuali allah dan muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam adalah hamba dan utusannya menegakkan sholat menunaikan zakat menunaikan haji ke baitullah dan berpuasa di bulan ramadhan
1341911 terangkanlah kepada mereka bahwa allah telah mewajibkan kepada mereka untuk mengeluarkan zakat yang dipungut dari orang orang kaya diantara mereka untuk diberikan kepada orang orang fakir dari mereka
1341912 pada harta harta mereka ada hak orang yang meminta dan

1342197 it is well known that rapid gsh synthesis in tumor cells is associated with high rates of cellular proliferation depletion of tumor gsh in vivo decreases the rate of cellular proliferation and inhibits cancer growth
1342198 selective depletion of tumor gsh may in fact render cancer cells more vulnerable to the action of chemotherapy and eventually protect normal tissue against the deleterious effects of chemotherapy

1342269 over the past six months we have been keenly aware that in light of the unstable economic climate we have been assigning past due accounts to vwa far more frequently with aging receivables dated 90 days past due as opposed to the usual 120 days we have been working in partnership with vwa for three years and they are an excellent third party collection outsource provider for us on the average we receive approximately an 80 return on the receivables assigned to vwa
1342270 2checkout com has been working with vwa for eight months and to date weve seen substantial recoveries of our bad debt receivables
1342271 we go through a process internally trying to retrieve funds from clients with a negative balance the process involves email phone and mail contact in an effort to recoup the funds owed if we cant collect them in 180 days the receivables are sent to vwa in the past year we have had a significant increase in aging receivables prompting us to work with vwa to recoup funds and improve our liquidity
1342272 when a comparison is made of the second quarter 2008 to the same quarter in 2007 dollars placed for collection with ccaa members rose substantially by approximately 24
1342273 in a contracting economy receivables become a prime concern for many companies as they stumble on roadblocks when it comes to reconciling their outstanding accounts and when that happens keeping a close eye on cash takes center stage working capital is squeezed at both ends as the business looks to negotiate better terms with suppliers and at the same time guard against inevitable customer defaults
1342274 tough economies always result in increased bad debt or the need to cure slow paying customers
1342275 based upon close interaction with clients and the marketplace the increased activity is in line with our expectations we anticipate these levels to continue for both commercial and consumer debt through 2008 the majorities of our clients have begun to tighten their extension of credit and are looking to liquidate their own receivables earlier in the collection cycle to mitigate any potential risk of additional write offs
1342276 argo and navstar have almost an identical approach to gps product development we both manufacture a small piece of hardware both of us outsource manufacturing to an oem in china and we both transmit data from our hardware to a server and provide customers with a wide variety of software services the opportunity for developing new feature rich products and services is very exciting
1342277 argos product development experience and talented engineering team when combined with navstars engineers will result in one of the best gps engineering teams in the industry argo products are proven in the market as they have generated over 4 million of revenue in the past several years revenue projections for the combined company for 2008 are 3 to 5 m
1342278 we are very pleased with this merger with navstar and feel the business model and technology base that navstar has developed will be exceptionally advantageous to argo navigation and its shareholders we are all excited about our synergies between these two companies and we are certain that we will be a strong player in fleet management asset people tracking and also in the navigation sector

1342282 we are honored to participate in omnitures marketing experts series
1342283 we design personas and plan content for our clients sites so they produce increased revenues solutions like omnitures sitecatalyst and discover help clients see those results
1342284 we used to have 20 to 30 pcs in each of our computer labs
1342285 upgrading that many pcs every three or four years would cost 24 000 but with ncomputing its just 3 200 and we deliver the exact same user experience now we can upgrade more often and have greatly improved the students perception of university technology resources
1342286 maintaining and supporting that many machines was overwhelming our small it staff
1342287 with ncomputing weve reduced support time by about 80 before ncomputing it would take us two days to perform upgrades in a single lab now we can get the job done in as little as two hours we have also realized some significant and unexpected benefits because the ncomputing devices dont take up any desktop space our students have more room for books and papers and because the devices dont generate heat rooms are cooler and our students are more comfortable
1342288 because ncomputing systems dramatically reduce the cost of deploying and maintaining pcs these institutions can meet that demand without breaking their already tight budgets thats just one reason why more than 10 000 educational institutions in 80 countries have chosen our solution
1342289 ncomputing has provided us substantial savings during some rough budget times
1342290 we are facing massive budget cutbacks at the same time that a lot of our older computers need to be replaced with ncomputing we are buying 75 fewer computers to get the same number of seats without ncomputing we would not have been able to replace the majority of those machines
1342291 running all of our old pcs generated so much heat that our air conditioning was running continuously and the rooms were still extremely uncomfortable
1342292 with ncomputing those rooms are now much much cooler in fact based on that experience our housing department asked us to deploy ncomputing in their facilities to save on electricity costs
1342293 in recent years the number of computers supported by our it staff has grown from 2 000 to 4 800 on four campuses
1342294 our it budget didnt grow at the same pace and our 12 staff members are increasingly stretched we also had a goal of replacing our computers every three years to stay current with technology we needed to find a new approach
1342295 we have 50 stations for computer based testing in our nursing education center in a traditional desktop environment setting up those 50 stations would take a massive amount of time deploying the ncomputing solution took less than 15 minutes per station to set up both the hardware and the software with seven ncomputing devices to one pc our school saved about 50 000 for that installation alone better yet installing a new test or performing maintenance takes us a fraction of the time it used to we are standardizing on ncomputing and will be deploying it to all areas where we have large concentrations of pcs used for office applications and internet browsing well then deploy ncomputing across all of our campuses its a no brainer
1342296 i founded ovguide com in 2006 as i saw the need for a destination to help individuals find online video and sites at the time did not provide a viable solution

1342881 cookie do you ever tire of being so obviously and provably wrong
1342882 mccain and his surrogates are insisting over and over again that tire pressure is the entire obama energy policy who exactly is supposed to believe such transparent nonsense consider a counter example mccain was talking about skin cancer the other day mccain emphasized that skin cancer is preventable and implored americans to wear sunscreen especially over the summer whats wrong with this advice not a thing its a smart sensible thing to say but imagine if obama and his surrogates said the entirety of mccains healthcare policy is sunscreen application mccain doesnt really care about cancer they could argue he just wants everyone to run out at get some spf 30 those vying to be obamas running mate started holding up bottles of coppertone during their speeches saying things like we want you to wear sunscreen you know it will very mildly improve your chances of not getting sick but wearing sunscreen is not a healthcare policy for the united states of america this of course would be insane and yet thats pretty much whats become of republican campaign rhetoric of late

1343107 there is a good question relating to election eve regarding the reasonableness of the use of authority without forefend wishing to impair when the prime minister resigns and waits to receive the endorsement of the public once again and when the operative meaning of the agreement is the removal of communities a dramatic change cutting into the living body of jerusalem etc it is a reasonable assumption that such sensitive matters require exceptional care if it is even at all possible to reach agreements on them the legal front is not the central one here but it clearly expresses that the government be trustee of the public the trustee of the entire public the trustee of the entire state and as such carefully weigh heavy decisions that divide the nation that are taken during the interim period without connection as to if the government will return after the elections or not i do not want to put barriers before the efforts for peace but it is my obligation to say what i have said

1343154 this is like the pc but smaller it is every bit as powerful just like the pc this is the platform for people to build new applications
1343155 with the new improvements in hardware and the new version 2 0 software they have fixed all the problems and made a great phone even better
1343156 as far as the interface and ease of use of phones it is above the others
1343157 as far as the 3g and gps goes it would have been nice on the first release but they had to be sure it was right
1343158 built in gps is a great addition but the iphones ambition might just have outstripped its battery technology
1343159 if you want to test your memory try to recall what you were worrying about one year ago today
1343160 somehow our devils are never quite what we expect when we meet them face to face
1343161 i am an old man and have known a great many troubles but most of them never happened
1343162 we found papers on one of the suspects saying that their religious beliefs are more important than their lives the prosperity of their families and even the well being of their mothers
1343163 this was well planned at least one month in advance
1343164 one of the men lost his arm in the explosion
1343165 they picked me up by the arms and legs and carried me into the courtyard they kicked me in the ribs and arms and one stood on my head with his boot
1343166 lehmans caught between a rock and a hard place theyre getting more and more pressure from regulators and investors to add reserves or mark these things down
1343167 in normal times they could wait it out but the market wants it done now
1343168 warum soll eine redaktion f r die nutzer nachrichten ausw hlen wenn dies freunde oder menschen mit gleichen interessen viel besser k nnen
1343169 empirical evidence shows a downward trend in overall trade costs in the last half century particularly significant is the reduction in air transport costs to far away destinations and the reduction in the time cost of transport
1343170 what do you mean i had a plan i read every damn writer i mimicked their styles i studied proposals i did this
1343171 we found papers on one of the suspects saying that their religious beliefs are more important than their lives the prosperity of their families and even the well being of their mothers they were trying to perform a jihad
1343172 one of the men lost his arm in the explosion the other is already on trial we recovered nine grenades two long knives two daggers and a gun
1343173 from our investigation this was well plotted for a long time at least a month
1343174 the attackers knew the times when the police do their jogging
1343175 they picked me up by the arms and legs and carried me into the courtyard they kicked me in the ribs and arms and one stood on my head with his boot
1343176 i was most surprised by how broad the effects were in the mice
1343177 usually you focus on slowing down or ameliorating one disease at a time in this case resveratrol influences a whole series of seemingly unrelated diseases associated with ageing
1343178 as far as bill is concerned the club has been for sale for the last five years this is nothing new
1343179 bill has always said that he would sell the club if the right people with the right finance came along
1343180 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1343181 it is not just a new face we need it is new faces my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably will not be ready to start the premier league season its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle
1343182 i am hoping we will have some in before the start of the season but i am not going to turn around and say i am totally confident because you never know what happens but yes i am hoping that we will end up getting a few in
1343183 he let us know in no uncertain terms that the season is only two weeks away he told us that we had to stop feeling sorry for ourselves stop thinking about who we are going to bring in stop thinking about everything else that is going on and to just get on with playing football
1343184 its incredibly professional im not surprised that people like me believed it was real its just incredibly sophisticated
1343185 es geht darum strategien zu erlernen um unter bestimmten stresssituationen zu funktionieren
1343186 von so einer vorbereitung konnte jeder andere bundestrainer nur tr umen wir haben die voraussetzungen geschaffen um gut abzuschneiden
1343187 bis jetzt geht es gut die pferde gew hnen sich mehr und mehr an das wetter
1343188 es zahlt sich aus dass wir unseren pferden im vorfeld beigebracht haben aus eimern zu trinken so k nnen sie auch auf dem trainingsfeld wasser zu sich nehmen
1343189 es ist mir ein r tsel dass es ein komitee gibt das die spiele nach hongkong vergibt
1343190 bei diesen bedingungen k nnen die pferde die eigene k rpertemperatur nicht mehr regulieren sie m ssen vier wochen gek hlt werden
1343191 we have an update to the information on the final fantasy info
1343192 now as to microsofts claims that the game will release simultaneously alongside the ps3 version in english territories well unless they know that the english ps3 version will be held up until the xbox 360 version is ready which would suck balls then that contradicts what square enix told us directly
1343193 there is no ps3 version of left 4 dead currently in production
1343194 for sorrento successfully completing the ibm system z gdps qualification program will be a strong proof point for the performance of our wdm products in real world environments

1343196 you dont have a mailing list how can you give your readers a weekly dose of cdm love to their inbox without a mailing list
1343197 well you know now that you put it that way there is no way we can give them a weekly dose of cdm love to their inbox if we dont have a mailing list
1343198 ich bin mir aber sicher dass die luft athleten und besuchern keine probleme machen wird
1343199 diese standards sind recht schwer einzuhalten aber in vielen bereichen gelingt peking das
1343200 wir wollen uns nicht schon sieben oder acht tage vorher der schlechten luft in peking aussetzen
1343201 while most etf providers continue to position their products as substitutes for traditional mutual funds an attribute from which we also benefit were seeing increased usage of select sector spdrs as substitutes for equities to reduce single stock exposure
1343202 spdr trading volume has averaged well over 200 million shares per day in 2008 as institutional investors take advantage of the outstanding liquidity to implement their trading strategies
1343203 es ist eine neue erfahrung in der mannschaft sind nicht viele sprinter oder klassikerfahrer das ist ein vorteil f r mich
1343204 this was a disgraceful and criminal campaign aimed at intimidating candidates and voters and subverting the democratic process it is vital that david cameron takes action to determine why watford conservatives failed to investigate the matter properly and to ensure that such an appalling course of events is never repeated
1343205 to ensure that such obviously unsuitable individuals are no longer selected as conservative candidates
1343206 we were tired of seeing the candidates tip toe around the issues and merely pay lip service so we created this questionnaire posing specific policy questions for the candidates to answer
1343207 the first phone call i placed was answered cordially i was told that someone would get back to me i never heard back from anyone
1343208 the second time i called the person i was speaking with hung up and the third time i called the line was disconnected
1343209 it is clear to me that the mccain campaign is not interested in speaking to the issues
1343210 we believe that they owe it not only to us to respond to the questionnaire but to their base
1343211 if they dont respond at that point we can only surmise that they do not take the latino community seriously and are truly delivering nothing more than political pandering to get the latino vote
1343212 we have a deferred maintenance backlog in california in our state parks system that tops over 1 2 billion
1343213 so were talking about restrooms that dont work buildings that are closed to the public trails that are closed to the public
1343214 we will provide all the technical detail necessary for these protection providers to very quickly develop signatures and updated protections for those vulnerabilities
1343215 the reality is that at 10 a m on patch tuesday the bad guys start reverse engineering
1343216 but as for the really bad exploitable stuff the bad guys are going to figure out which ones those are on their own very easily anyways
1343217 as long as i work for microsoft we will not pay for bugs
1343218 i believe part of my job in working with the security research community was to figure out how to engage that community in a positive way
1343219 microsoft has a lot of assets and we provide attribution in our bulletins thats an asset that we have and are willing to use
1343220 without the support of the americans we would not have accomplished the mission because the british forces had done nothing there
1343221 i do not trust the british forces they did not want to lose any soldiers for the mission
1343222 everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
1343223 the charge of the knights operation in basra was planned led and executed by the iraqis
1343224 there was no accommodation which prevented uk troops from entering basra the reason why troops were not sent in immediately was because there was no structure in place in the city for units to go back in to start mentoring the iraqi troops
1343225 the success of the mission made it clear that to build on the confidence and experience gained by 14 division a more specialised training approach could be delivered out on the ground in basra and the uk military transition teams mitts were introduced
1343226 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1343227 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than imagined
1343228 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1343229 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight
1343230 even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first
1343231 a deal of this size at this stage of the cycle is something of a brave move for adecco given the economic backdrop
1343232 adeccos stated strategy is to expand its professional operations in the u s europe and asia as well as looking at specialised general staffing companies
1343233 on valuation the rumoured 350 370 pence bid would still undervalue the long term prospects of the business long term fair value of our forecasts is 445 pence

1343236 your campaign of lying had a devastating effect on two young men who loved and believed in you
1343237 this will be the biggest olympics yet and the gb team goes into it better prepared than ever before
1343238 other countries and old rivals like australia now look to us as a country that got serious about sport and are now saying they are in danger of falling behind team gb in the medal table
1343239 we are about to enter a glorious new era for british sport and i hope success in beijing will inspire the next generation of young sports stars
1343240 that is a serious target we want it to be achieved its vital in the sense of the investment thats gone in
1343241 a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage
1343242 theres a real irony when it comes to offshore drilling its done so we can get more oil in the hopes of reducing gas prices in the meantime we keep burning fossil fuels which causes more global warming which leads to more hurricanes which lead to more oil lost in spills and yet drilling does almost nothing to alleviate the cost of gasoline
1343243 government studies have indicated that it will take a decade for any offshore drilling to pay off even minimally and even then prices will only be reduced by a few cents per gallon
1343244 important to recognise if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for 10 years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that
1343245 we are delighted to be acquiring this unique parcel of freehold land in the port of long beach it is strategically located close to highway 710 and will provide excellent access to the greater los angeles metropolitan area the largest market for construction aggregates on the west coast of north america we will now concentrate on the permitting and development of a highly efficient and environmentally progressive facility which could make possible the commencement of sand and gravel distribution by the beginning of 2011
1343246 we also anticipate that the acquisition of the pier b land will play an important part in facilitating the development of our proposed eagle rock quarry on which we are currently conducting a feasibility study
1343247 lassana is a bit behind the rest in terms of general fitness
1343248 he needs to be ready for a week on sunday not necessarily wembley
1343249 i would suggest that a minority of people had hidden them with the intention of causing harm to police officers and possibly to the horses or dogs we are using on patrol
1343250 to link a stash of knives allegedly found somewhere in the hoo peninsula in kent to the camp for climate action is nothing but a smear campaign against us
1343251 to suggest that the campers environmentalists living at a camp serving only vegan food would even consider hurting a police horse shows the polices press release to be nothing but political policing
1343252 this in no way justifies the way the police are treating the camp
1343253 it is disgraceful to suggest that the campers have criminal intent
1343254 this is obviously an attempt by the police to distract us from raising issues about climate change
1343255 i think its probably going to be a different style
1343256 its going to be interesting to see how he couples that with his batting and interesting to see how he wins the dressing room over
1343257 that will be the interesting thing hes an unbelievable batsman one of the worlds best and whether that the captaincy hampers his batting or not remains to be seen
1343258 he has had a lot of challenges over the years and he has risen to every one of those so itll be interesting to see if he rises to this one
1343259 i think he deserved all the accolades he got from the job he did for england
1343260 he was always very dignified and very honourable and the way he went out the other day was fantastic even if it was a little sad for a lot of us watching
1343261 but its now a new era for england and it will be interesting to see what kp brings to the job we can only wish kp well in his tenure as captain but maybe it will be better if that starts after the oval test
1343262 pc tools is a global leader in innovative software products designed to protect the privacy and security of windows computer users
1343263 you really dont know whats in a banks or insurance companys portfolio until after the fact
1343264 in markets that are very strong and are running very rapidly we likely will tend to lag
1343265 that will allow them to do well regardless of whats going on in the environment around them
1343266 were really trying to understand what makes the company tick in more detail than what you could get from a phone call
1343267 when he left i was surprised because he was very well respected at the company and we thought very highly of him
1343268 so i called him up and tried to understand what it was that he saw at rsc
1343269 goldie loves everyone and all other dogs and yes even cats i only wish i was as always as good natured and happy as she is

1343300 the arrangement is the first mechanism of its kind and we are very proud of this historic step american charities for palestine acp will raise american charitable contributions and will work with usaid to direct these funds to support ongoing projects in the field

1343304 essential for building the foundations of a palestinian state as part of realizing the visions of an end of conflict based on two states palestine and israel living side by side in peace and security
1343305 i believe that there could be no greater legacy for america than to help to bring into being a palestinian state for a people who have suffered too long who have been humiliated too long who have not reached their potential for too long and who have so much to give to the international community and to all of us i promise you my personal commitment to that goal

1343383 mike and rob have a lot of proven experience in their respective jobs and they will be a real asset to the management team and the squad as a whole
1343384 it is vital the medical support and the logistics of the squad run smoothly and i am confident mike and rob will both play a major role in the management team moving forward
1343385 its all very river cottage hugh fearnley whittingstall would be very proud of us

1343388 id love to be in an opera write a novel and get a degree in psychology or anthropology
1343389 but what i want above everything else is to be a good mum
1343390 i am committed to giving the police the tools they need to get crime off our streets tasers are making a real difference on our streets not only keeping the public safe but also protecting our police officers
1343391 tasers have contributed to resolving incidents without injury where otherwise there would have been a real possibility of someone being seriously injured or killed in a significant proportion of cases they have not needed to be fired drawing or aiming the taser has been enough of a deterrent
1343392 i struggle to connect the claire i knew with the claire who has done this
1343393 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift it is not just a new face we need it is new faces
1343394 as far as bill is concerned the club has been for sale for the last five years this is nothing new

1343396 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift it is not just a new face we need it is new faces
1343397 my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably will not be ready to start the premier league season its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle

1343400 these figures will do nothing to quell fears that the economy is sliding towards negative growth and the prospect of a technical recession looks increasingly likely
1343401 it is clear that manufacturers are now being hit hard by muted domestic demand weakening activity in key export markets elevated energy and commodity prices and tight credit conditions
1343402 while a significantly weaker pound is providing a much needed boost to uk manufacturers this is being countered by significantly slowing growth in the eurozone and a stagnant us economy
1343403 generally over the last couple of weeks the global price of a barrel of oil has dropped from its peak of 147 to 120
1343404 slowly but surely we have seen a steady decline in pump prices which was initiated by the supermarket price war however the diesel price has crept up slightly in the last day or so
1343405 any pump price above 1 per litre causes hardship and misery for many millions of car dependent motorists already 55 per cent of aa members have cut back on journeys due to prices at the pumps and others are sticking to speed limits and eco driving to make their expensive fuel go further
1343406 the award of this contract is an important recognition of the technical expertise and experience of denison environmental services and expands the reach of our rehabilitation efforts across the country
1343407 this was a disgraceful and criminal campaign aimed at intimidating candidates and voters and subverting the democratic process
1343408 it is vital that david cameron takes action to determine why watford conservatives failed to investigate the matter properly and to ensure that such an appalling course of events is never repeated
1343409 to ensure that such obviously unsuitable individuals are no longer selected as conservative candidates
1343410 there is a general agreement that something has to be done to improve levels of respect for the game s long term health
1343411 i am delighted that the whole game is working together on this issue
1343412 there is a general agreement that something has to be done to improve levels of respect for the games long term health
1343413 this has been a personal priority and i would like to thank our various partner organisations for their support
1343414 this is not only about players and managers at the top of the game acknowledging the impact that their behaviour has further down the football pyramid but also about addressing the most pressing issues in the grassroots game
1343415 changing a culture is about long term commitment to change negative attitudes and abusive behaviour it needs the whole game working together to make a real difference and that is what collectively we have done
1343416 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1343417 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1343418 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1343419 we are pleased with the transaction that has been announced today which allows merc to aggressively advance this high grade gold project our equity interest allows us continued exposure to damoti as merc looks towards development of a potential high grade mining operation

1343421 you heard me maam drop the peanut butter cookie and back away slowly
1343422 i dont want an argument here just drop the cookie and raise your hands above your head
1343423 maam you cant go waving around that cookie youre within 100 yards of an elementary school that cookie is a lethal weapon
1343424 but i baked it this morning cant i just eat it wait no dont shoot fine ill drop it see i dropped it
1343425 you people now we need to seal off this whole area and do another detox do you know how long that takes cripes and you couldve killed somebodys kid too cant you read the signs
1343426 and it was a good cookie too wait theres signs
1343427 of course theres signs theres signs here and here and over there too under penalty of law no peanuts may enter these premises
1343428 in contrast with ottawa and the new york rangers the ideal offensive team is not the aim in fact lamoriello emphasizes the need for the exercise of brute power where necessary and demonstrated as much through the play of scott stevens
1343429 part of the difficulty in interpreting burke arises from the uniquely provocative style of his outbursts he frequently delivered trenchant critiques of player salaries and of fellow gms like kevin lowe in the most offensive terms possible given the context his arguments often employed ad hominem attacks and emotional appeals and he often jumps from one grand assertion to another escalating player salaries tampering with little sustained logical support or elucidation of the connection between his ideas
1343430 to further demonstrate the limitations of valuing a player based on his past performance cliff fletcher proceeds with what is known as the wax argument he considers jeff finger as a piece of wax his senses inform him that finger has certain characteristics such as being a career ahl d man who had his best offensive season in his nhl career last season playing for an offensively talented avs team when he brings the finger to toronto these characteristics will be expected to change completely as does a piece of wax that is brought near a flame as every player in the nhl dreams of one day playing for the leafs therefore in order to properly grasp the nature of jeff finger he cannot use logic or rational thought he must go out of his mind and pay out his ass to acquire him
1343431 when communication goes missing so does our youth dont close the door to communication
1343432 we would encourage people who are avoiding family members for whatever reason to make some contact even if they might not want to return
1343433 people need closure even if theyve got issues in the family they need to know that the person is all right
1343434 not a shift goes by when theres not a person reported missing and a majority of those are in their teens
1343435 they might have issues at home and cant cope with them and have decided to take time out
1343436 there are some of course that dont return and for whatever reason known to themselves feel they cant return
1343437 when a family member or friend vanishes from your life its the sense of not knowing that can be absolutely devastating
1343438 some of the missing persons cases we are highlighting today involve people who have been missing for more than 30 years whereas others have been missing for just a few months
1343439 any piece of information can be of help to police in a missing persons case a possible sighting a conversation a telephone call or any detail relating to a missing person could be the final link police need to end the questions of family and friends

1343512 a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage
1343513 theres a real irony when it comes to offshore drilling its done so we can get more oil in the hopes of reducing gas prices in the meantime we keep burning fossil fuels which causes more global warming which leads to more hurricanes which lead to more oil lost in spills and yet drilling does almost nothing to alleviate the cost of gasoline
1343514 government studies have indicated that it will take a decade for any offshore drilling to pay off even minimally and even then prices will only be reduced by a few cents per gallon
1343515 important to recognise if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for 10 years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that

1343550 sebuah gedung apakah kalian tahu berapa harga sebuah gedung kami memiliki lebih dari 7 5 juta dolar hanya untuk bangunan fisik harvard

1343553 we had a son who attended harvard for one year he loved harvard he was happy here but about a year ago he was accidentally killed and my husband and i would like to erect a memorial to him somewhere on campus
1343554 we cant put up a statue for every person who attended harvard and died if we did this place would look like a cemetery
1343555 we dont want to erect a statue we thought we would like to give a building to harvard
1343556 a building do you have any earthly idea how much a building costs we have over seven and a half million dollars in the physical plant at harvard
1343557 is that all it costs to start a university why dont we just start our own

1343559 sono fiero di appartenere a uno stato in cui un premier pu essere investigato come un semplice cittadino un premier non pu essere al di sopra della legge ma nemmeno al di sotto se devo scegliere fra me la consapevolezza di essere innocente e il fatto che restando al mio posto possa mettere in grave imbarazzo il paese che amo e che ho lonore di rappresentare non ho dubbi mi faccio da parte perch anche il primo ministro devessere giudicato come gli altri dimostrer che le accuse di corruzione sono infondate da cittadino qualunque errori ne ho commessi e me ne pento per la carica che occupo ero consapevole di poter finire al centro di attacchi feroci ma nel mio caso si passata la misura

1343661 i generally have a bet i make for new light and heavy commuter rail systems i bet that for the amount the system cost to build every single daily rider could have instead been given a prius to drive for the same money and with the operating losses and or subsidy the system requires each year every one of those prius drivers could be given enough gas to make their daily commute and still have money left over i have tested this bet for the systems in los angeles and albuquerque well it turns out i left something out many people are interested in commuter rail because it is perceived to be greener which nowadays generally means narrowly that it uses less energy and thus produces less co2 but in fact it may not
1343662 theres two things that we need to understand about these permits and green taxes the first is that theres a difference in the effects of a carbon tax and these cap and trade systems using permits with tax we know what the cost will be but not what the emissions reductions will be with permits we know what the emissions will be but not the cost i prefer the tax because it makes clearer and more transparent the cost benefit analysis but feel free to differ but if the tax and the permit prices turn out to be at the same level then the two systems are functionally equivalent however a cap and trade system where some permits are given away is not the same as a carbon tax its the same as a carbon tax plus corporate pork

1343669 together these aspects should have alerted them sooner to the possibility they were dealing with a potential murder inquiry

1343688 if your tired of doctors writing you off and not really caring whether or not you recover from your back pain then give this video a try my lower back was wracked with pain i couldnt sit for long periods of time and when i awoke from a nights sleep instead of being well rested my aching back was there to remind me of the pain that would be with me throughout the day the doctors couldnt help me or didnt want to take the time and so i took matters into my own hands and came across this video i figured it couldnt hurt and jesses and steves view that back pain has more to do with muscle imbalances brought on by a lifetime of abuse and neglect than anything else made sense to me well four weeks into the program and my back has never felt better even within a week or two i noticed a difference if you dont think drugs are the answer and you want to take more control of your own health then give the video a shot youll be glad you did

1343719 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1343720 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1343721 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1343722 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease

1343730 until now the only option for transplant patients has been to take a cocktail of drugs for the rest of their lives
1343731 these drugs can cause severe side effects and cannot always prevent the slow destructive process of chronic rejection which often leads to the failure of the transplanted organ
1343732 that is why our use of transplant acceptance inducing cells taics in kidney transplant patients is such an exciting development as it could eventually offer patients who have had transplant surgery a much higher quality of life free from complex drug regimes
1343733 although our use of taics is still in the preliminary stages the results of our clinical trials on 17 kidney transplant patients are promising
1343734 we concluded that although the stage one trial showed that taic therapy was both safe and clinically practicable the trial was unable to provide evidence that postoperative taic administration has a beneficial effect
1343735 although our stage two clinical trial did not provide conclusive evidence of a beneficial effect of pre operative taics treatment the results were encouraging
1343736 they suggest that taics promote a physical state that might allow us to minimise the drugs we use to stop the patients immune system from rejecting their new organ
1343737 our research clearly shows that infusing taics into patients before they have a kidney transplant or after the procedure has been carried out is a practical and safe clinical option
1343738 although this procedure is still being developed and refined it poses an exciting possibility for clinicians and patients alike

1343843 lord jesus has saved me from sin and death and lord has chosen me for his ministry i believe i have faithfully and truthfully done it according the word of god by the guidance of the holy spirit whenever our lord thinks my service is enough in this world he has to call me back at any time to be with him i am always ready for it
1343844 i never earned or gain anything worldly for my wife and children from the ministry i hand over the ministry and all of its assests programmes and activities to the governing board in which my wife or children are not the members
1343845 our lord weighs our minds and hearts he knows all of us very well do not misuse his physical and economical gifts for worldly pleasures like the sons of the prophet samuel do not misuse his spiritual gifts like balaam yet we may be reviled persecuted and experienced all manner of evil against us falsely certainly it strengthen our spirituality when it comes from gentiles and outcasters but it is very difficult to tolerate if it comes from our dear brotheren of whom we love and trust in the name of jesus they may be called as missionaries pastors and evangelists such experiences from them will make us desperate depress and discourage it affect both our body and spirit

1343847 but we must careful that there are true and valuable currencies it is indeed necessary for any transactions thats why false currencies are spreading widely but realise the false currencies have no value and it is to be destructed also handling the false currencies is a big crime so distinguish the good and evil spirits our lord allows the tares with the wheat together until the harvest so recognise them by their fruits dont be cheated our lord is the burning fire too
1343848 the harvest is plentiful but the labourers are few so our lord asked to pray to the owner of the harvest for sending suitable labourers in certain places there were such a vast and beautiful harvest to reap but unsuitable labourers got down the field and reaped some of it for their own use not for the lord and destructed the rest of the harvest and soil became hard by their feet and made the fields desert even no more cultivation is possible then how can we reap india is a best example for it 60 of the land of the kingdom of israel is desert it is not too far those desert lands can be formed as gardens it can be possible by culturing the sea water and make it flow to the desert lands the bride church of our lord is called as the israel of the new covenent certainly still there are plenty of harvest to reap but not full of harvest harvest must be reaped but at the same time 60 of the new covenant israel also keep going on desert land we have to sow the seed before sowing the seed the land must be plouged and watered water must be coming from the sea as cultured useful drinking water sea water is salty and it is the synonym of sin the religions of muslims hindus budhists communists nominal christians etc around us are great oceans by our deep faith and prayer we can culture the salty oceanic water which is sins of this world by the precious blood of jesus and make it flow to the desert minded hearts and plough it by our loving deeds and dedicated services by the holy spirit and sow the seed of the word of god the kingdom of god is not barren there is no desert there is no sea it is the tabernacle of god with his bride and he will be dwelling among us for that we have to serve the lord he is not a godly labourer if a person comes for harvest without thinking of how such a desert land makes plenty of harvest so sow with tears and reap with cheers

1344004 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
1344005 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas
1344006 i will not pretend we can achieve them without cost or without sacrifice or without the contribution of almost every american citizen

1344009 the pmi data for july indicated no improvement at the start of the third quarter as they pointed to a substantial fall in service activity and a record contraction of employment
1344010 furthermore firms were not expecting an improvement in the near future with sentiment at a survey low
1344011 broadly speaking little regard is had to competition issues in considering zoning or planning proposals
1344012 the complexities of planning applications and in particular the public consultation and objections processes provide the opportunity for coles and woolworths to game the planning system to delay or prevent potential competitors entering local areas
1344013 in particular existing centres policies combined with the strong preference of existing centre owners to lease space to the major supermarket chains rather than independent supermarkets or new entrants is likely to lead to a greater concentration of supermarket sites in the hands of coles and woolworths
1344014 given the high barriers to entry in grocery supermarket retailing including the difficulty in obtaining suitable supermarket sites the accc considers that new ways of incorporating competition analysis into planning decisions should be considered
1344015 weve been concerned for some time that the town planning laws were acting in an anti competitive way and denying the opportunity for new entrants and existing players to offer choice to local communities
1344016 this is the accc saying there are serious limitations being imposed on grocery competition because of town planning laws and consumers are losing out
1344017 town planning laws will be dragged out of the 1980s eastern european mentality and will have to embrace the idea of competition
1344018 that means ensuring there is enough zoned land available to enable entrepreneurs to build new supermarkets to meet the needs of local markets
1344019 zoning and planning polices and in particular consideration of individual planning applications should have specific regard to competition issues specifically whether proposed developments would assist in facilitating the entry into an area of a supermarket operator that is not presently operating in the area
1344020 i just didnt know what to do i was in terrible shock
1344021 they treated me as guilty they all believed that it was me
1344022 i would have no doubt that any investigator would do the same thing without the forensics you would be 100 per cent confident the right person was arrested and charged thats how emphatic and compelling the evidence was
1344023 i said i have got records at work that show that i was at work but they didnt do any research
1344024 i had given up hope i felt that no one was going to believe me the police made me think that it was me that id done all these things so in my mind i had to go through it to think whether i really did rape anyone or not thats how much they put it on me
1344025 if the police cant get their act together and they are making that kind of mistake the protection of the courts is needed
1344026 it is a question of fact in each circumstance as to whether or not police have been negligent if they have not met a reasonable standard of conduct in having sufficient evidence to lay charges then it is possible for a court to hold police liable to compensate a person for loss and damage suffered

1344028 this is another example of where morris iemmas rhetoric and promises have not been matched with action domestic violence is one area where this labor government in particular should be focusing given its well publicised problems
1344029 domestic violence will never be tackled head on while we have a labor government that fails to provide enough police and expert staff to deal with it
1344030 the iemma government is committed to tackling domestic violence which is a shameful crime
1344031 that is why in may of this year the government established a new central domestic and family violence unit
1344032 it is based at the police force headquarters in parramatta and includes five domestic violence experts who are sworn police officers working with civilian staff

1344068 the most startling revelation from this intelligence success story was that the anthrax program had been developed in parallel to 9 11 planning as best as we could determine project had been wrapped up in the summer of 2001 when the al qaida deputy along with hambali were briefed over a week by sufaat on the progress he had made to isolate anthrax the entire operation had been managed at the top of with strict compartmentalization having completed this phase of his work sufaat fled afghanistan in december 2001 and was captured by authorities trying to sneak back into malaysia rauf ahmad was detained by pakistani authorities in december 2001 our hope was that these and our many other actions had neutralized the anthrax threat at least temporarily

1344163 unlike past batman films where the villains were somewhat surreal and comical figures heath ledgers joker is a brilliantly acted but very credible psychopathic killer who extols the use of knives to kill and disfigure his victims during a reign of urban terrorism laced with torture
1344164 it is a relentlessly violent film filled with dark themes and as i left i wondered what the board could possibly have been thinking there is no way that a parent could have been guided by the classification and realised what they were about to see
1344165 theres a line between good entertainment and something which influences young minds we need to be very vigilant in terms of what we do about these issues

1344170 bei den afrikanischen arten standen immer die gro affen wie gorillas und bonobos im vordergrund und obwohl sie stark bedroht sind sind es die kleineren primaten wie der rote stummelaffe die zuerst aussterben k nnten

1344172 there are vast numbers of devices scattered across a large area serving the many needs of the village from beautification to safety to energy efficiency because the lonworks products from our various suppliers integrate easily we were able to install and configure the project in less than two months helping to ensure that the olympic village will open on schedule
1344173 beijing is making substantial if not historic efforts to produce the first green games that impact not only the olympic venues but the entire country
1344174 intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1344175 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq
1344176 now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1344177 there was no such order from the white house to me
1344178 listen marine youre not going to like this but here goes
1344179 the goats were taken into custody and turned over to the army once it was determined not to be illegal aliens or agents of terror
1344180 a minimum price for other bidders during the auction process
1344181 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1344182 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1344183 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1344184 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1344185 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1344186 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1344187 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless bush said at eielson air force base where he posed for photos with airmen and soldiers and worked the crowd at one point lifting a baby in the air
1344188 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1344189 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country
1344190 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1344191 we are your bankers we are very cautious and we take a long time to make a decision when it suits us to make one at all

1344193 the episcopal church in the united states continues its practice of moving farther and farther away from what the bible teaches us they act as if the holy scriptures have nothing to say about life and how we should live it now that they are openly ordaining gay bishops and ignoring the gospel message what is left for them to ignore the episcopal church is like a ship without a rudder they have nowhere left to look for direction and guidance
1344194 what bishop katharine jefferts schori must do is lead the episcopal church in a revival of studying the bible they must ask themselves what the bible says and then simply do it they are in serious danger of straying so far from scripture that they will cease to be a church at all they must be careful that their traditions do not get in the way of what the inspired word has to say even today
1344195 we understand the popes concerns after all we did make the mistake of breaking with rome 500 years ago however what is done is done and we are moving onward
1344196 despite his good intentions the pope has made an assumption that is faulty he assumes that a true church must follow scripture what he must not yet understand is that the episcopal church has evolved to the point of no longer needing the bible in fact i dont even own one we now gain our wisdom and understanding from higher forms such as our own minds statues crystals stars and moons and little blue men that inhabit the cellars of our church buildings we have found this new bible free church life to be very liberating i invite the pope to try it sometime he really needs to move past his fixation on the bible
1344197 my first job in all honesty is going to continue to be mom in chief

1344200 no secret deal or accommodation kept us out of the city
1344201 as 90 percent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem
1344202 but actually the jaish al mahdi the mahdi army had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
1344203 there was no structure in place in the city for units to go back in and start mentoring the iraqi troops
1344204 when the action was launched british forces provided a raft of military support including armor artillery airpower medical and logistic support
1344205 what happened in basra nasiriyah amarah and other areas falls on the shoulders of the british forces
1344206 basra is considered the economic capital of iraq but the british let the militias do what they wanted

1344210 the introduction of these new programs helps address evolving online threats and provides more practical guidance to assess and manage risk
1344211 in the race between exploit and protection microsoft is committed to shifting the advantage to the security industry the microsoft active protections program gives security software providers the information and resources they need to help better protect customers
1344212 as security threats become more sophisticated the global security community must combine its resources and work together to provide maximum security protections to worldwide internet users
1344213 no one organization can counter online attacks alone therefore we must use the combined strength of the industry partners customers and public organizations to build a more secure environment for everyone
1344214 microsoft has managed to enshrine its ignorance about oss in a public document
1344215 when white people are invited to think about obamas physical appearance the principal attribute theyre likely to dwell on is his dark skin consequently any reference to obamas other physical attributes cant help coming off as a coy walk around the barn

1344217 the press would be wise to avoid discussing how ordinary americans will respond to the size of obamas ears the thickness of obamas eyebrows and so on

1344222 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1344223 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1344224 it couldnt come at a worse time and it seems to me that the bbc is insensitive or completely disregards the impact of its plans on the commercial media in the regions
1344225 we have our own video journalists but they have to do other jobs as well we cant afford to employ dedicated video journalists the bbc can because of its level of funding
1344226 the bbc in terms of local video based reporting is behind most regional publications at the moment but it wont take them long to catch up
1344227 people are very well served theres no need for the bbc to do video we are saying it will significantly harm the revenues and profitability of regional press
1344228 it has used its massive public funding and resources brand potency unrivalled distribution network and cross promotional opportunities to become the most powerful media brand in the world and the leading uk player in television radio and on the internet now it is seeking to extend that market leadership into the provision of local news and information

1344252 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1344253 clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of the year
1344254 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1344255 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1344256 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1344257 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1344258 the review paints a bleak picture some primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction but it is by no means a doomsday scenario there is a lot of will here among these scientists in edinburgh and in the countries where primates live
1344259 after property in question the housing market is undergoing a slow home price growth question and becoming more and more of a number of different individuals and sellers

1344261 my gawd i could die now and never be happier because this is the best thing ive ever put in my mouth supreme ranking
1344262 ive had four other jobs as c e o and i came out of them all pretty well
1344263 what im working for right now is to save my reputation
1344264 at this time on a sunday afternoon it is likely that there were some witnesses to this incident
1344265 i would like to speak to anyone who may have been in the park or nearby and saw anything suspicious or someone fitting the description of the offender
1344266 the quality of our drinking water is better than ever and it has consistently been ranked high in recent taste tests
1344267 its the bullying mentality it goes on in reading but what i feel is that its still not being reported
1344268 we need to get people to report it or else the police will think that nothings going on and that it doesnt happen
1344269 at the moment people dont feel they can call the police or that the police can be bothered with it but thats not the case they do want to help and theyre being educated in issues and becoming more sympathetic to people
1344270 quite often its a zero rating and we know thats not true
1344271 fears of insolvency have not as yet been fully set aside
1344272 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
1344273 lower global stock prices could impede the recapitalization of banks and other financial institutions debt issuance would also be suppressed as it leverages off the level of equity
1344274 the price of equities worldwide will determine whether the international financial system can maintain a modicum of stability as it eases out of its credit crunch or falls back into another period of angst and turmoil
1344275 the cause of our economic despair however is human natures propensity to sway from fear to euphoria and back a condition that no economic paradigm has proved capable of suppressing without severe hardship
1344276 regulation the alleged effective solution to todays crisis has never been able to eliminate historys crises
1344277 we may not easily confront or accept the price dynamics of home and equity prices but we can fend off cries of political despair which counsel the containment of competitive markets
1344278 it is essential that we do so the remarkably strong performance of the world economy since the near universal adoption of market capitalism is testament to the benefits of increasing economic flexibility
1344279 i went into the workshop with the two polish men and saw all this machinery
1344280 the words tony said was oh dear this is serious i am going to ring the police
1344281 we looked inside the steel shed and saw drills and cutting equipment i saw what i believed to be ammunition i picked it up to see if it was live and i thought it was so i put it down and told everyone to get out
1344282 i used to be a member of a gun club so i have some knowledge of firearms i also saw what i believed to be gun barrels on the floor and i thought that the machinery looked to be of the type used in the manufacture of guns

1344295 there is supposed to be ice at the north pole not water
1344296 as far as we can tell this has not happened for at least 20 000 years the real shock is that it has happened so quickly with ice formed in the winter melting by the summer
1344297 i do not do this for myself i do it for the lord above and whatever he sets me out to do for the community
1344298 we cant afford to do the same thing over and over again and expect a different result
1344299 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
1344300 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1344301 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington

1344303 in spite of difficult economic conditions in several of our key markets our parks performed reasonably well during the first half of 2008
1344304 through the end of the second quarter our parks entertained 7 6 million visitors average in park guest per capita spending was 40 45 and out of park revenues totaled 40 5 million this compares with attendance of 6 7 million average in park guest per capita spending of 40 68 and out of park revenues of 38 3 million through the second quarter of 2007
1344305 overall in light of the current economy we are satisfied with our results through the first half of the year
1344306 attendance and revenue trends continued to improve across all of our properties toward the end of june and through the peak vacation month of july over the next several months we will continue to introduce new marketing programs that add value to a park visit and attract families choosing to vacation closer to home
1344307 in general we are pleased with the performance of our parks through july
1344308 when we purchased the paramount parks in june of 2006 we believed these parks operated in stronger regional markets when compared with our legacy parks this geographic diversification has proven to be beneficial to us thus far as we continue to see strength in the toronto market along with the washington d c charlotte and san francisco markets these stronger markets have helped to balance some of the early season softness we experienced from the detroit cleveland and minneapolis st paul markets where several of our legacy parks operate
1344309 we ended the second quarter of 2008 in sound financial condition in terms of both liquidity and cash flow
1344310 although attendance and revenue expectations through july were higher than we achieved we are satisfied with our results particularly given the continued pressures on the discretionary dollar as a result of higher gas prices and current economic conditions
1344311 with approximately 45 of our budgeted attendance still ahead of us it is imperative that we continue the positive momentum we experienced during the month of july into the other peak vacation month of august and the important fall season we are hopeful we will continue to see growth in attendance while maintaining the in park guest per capita spending as families continue to look for entertainment closer to home at this time based on preliminary results through july we are reaffirming our full year guidance of net revenues between 990 million to 1 02 billion and full year adjusted ebitda between 340 355 million

1344324 while blu ray discs bd offering both 25gb and 50gb are sufficient for users current demands we envision the need for a technology that can support far greater capacities as hd streaming in particular becomes commonplace and users build larger files of digital content

1344326 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence

1344328 to meet the new standards well in advance of 2020
1344329 the industry has made a commitment to step forward and support these aggressive standards
1344330 i think we are going to be able to satisfy those requirements
1344331 theyre playing the same old game of insisting they cant do it even though reality is hitting them in the face
1344332 our scissor lifts allow the product being worked on to maintain the correct height
1344333 think about how much easier it is to work at shoulder level rather than knee level the absence of quality scissor lifts such as ours often results in backaches and other medical issues
1344334 with our scissor lifts a 30 box skid would take almost no time to position two minutes per box to put near the work area and another two minutes per box to lift and move
1344335 this is over two hours of time you can save our combination of lifts not only save a lot of time but remove a big source of back pain too
1344336 now we have lots of choices of games to play

1344342 were going to do something that the iau did not which is discuss what we know about planetary bodies in the solar system and around other stars and discuss the value of different ways of defining objects as planets and what that means
1344343 if a new consensus emerges it will easily overturn the iau this is not an issue
1344344 if not theyll stick with what theyve got until something better comes along
1344345 ive been arguing pluto for eight years so its another occasion where im arguing pluto this one happens to be a little more formal in its construct so i see it as another day of just trying to tell people teach people about what we now know about the solar system

1344347 the collaboration the intersection of ideas has its own way of creating new understanding
1344348 this topic provides the perfect opportunity to teach science as a process not a collection of facts
1344349 we also need to stress the importance of incorporating new discoveries to continually improve our understanding of the diverse objects within planetary systems
1344350 no votes will be taken at this conference to put specific objects in or out of the family of planets
1344351 but we will have advocates of the iau definition and proponents of alternative definitions presenting their cases
1344352 theres a lot of emotion still a lot of room for opinion

1344361 our new research suggests schizophrenia is a by product of the increased metabolic demands brought about during human brain evolution our brains are unique among all species in their enormous metabolic demand if we can explain how our brains sustain such a tremendous metabolic flow we will have a much better chance to understand how the brain works and why it sometimes breaks
1344362 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is

1344373 in spite of difficult economic conditions in several of our key markets our parks performed reasonably well during the first half of 2008
1344374 through the end of the second quarter our parks entertained 7 6 million visitors average in park guest per capita spending was 40 45 and out of park revenues totaled 40 5 million this compares with attendance of 6 7 million average in park guest per capita spending of 40 68 and out of park revenues of 38 3 million through the second quarter of 2007
1344375 overall in light of the current economy we are satisfied with our results through the first half of the year
1344376 attendance and revenue trends continued to improve across all of our properties toward the end of june and through the peak vacation month of july over the next several months we will continue to introduce new marketing programs that add value to a park visit and attract families choosing to vacation closer to home
1344377 in general we are pleased with the performance of our parks through july
1344378 when we purchased the paramount parks in june of 2006 we believed these parks operated in stronger regional markets when compared with our legacy parks this geographic diversification has proven to be beneficial to us thus far as we continue to see strength in the toronto market along with the washington d c charlotte and san francisco markets these stronger markets have helped to balance some of the early season softness we experienced from the detroit cleveland and minneapolis st paul markets where several of our legacy parks operate
1344379 we ended the second quarter of 2008 in sound financial condition in terms of both liquidity and cash flow
1344380 although attendance and revenue expectations through july were higher than we achieved we are satisfied with our results particularly given the continued pressures on the discretionary dollar as a result of higher gas prices and current economic conditions
1344381 with approximately 45 of our budgeted attendance still ahead of us it is imperative that we continue the positive momentum we experienced during the month of july into the other peak vacation month of august and the important fall season we are hopeful we will continue to see growth in attendance while maintaining the in park guest per capita spending as families continue to look for entertainment closer to home at this time based on preliminary results through july we are reaffirming our full year guidance of net revenues between 990 million to 1 02 billion and full year adjusted ebitda between 340 355 million

1344411 this particular talent spec is built in mind for leveling a hunter with minimul downtime as the pet can be healed by bandages spells and food were gunna use a beast mastery spec of 41 20 0 unlike the prior build shop on the same spec the point distribution will be different as this is ment for a solo grinding roll rather than a group raiding one
1344412 obviously its an immigrant city people who want to migrate risk taking open minded self expressive
1344413 i think the things that strike me personally as my first time here ill just be quite candid one is the incredible natural beauty
1344414 vancouver i think better than just about any city in north america and probably comparable to some australian cities does a wonderful job of being both urban and natural and my hunch is thats a kind of environment that appeals to more and more people
1344415 the other thing that strikes me on one side its a positive the other side a not so positive is that this city is just incredibly affluent it really boggled my mind even compared to toronto which aint shabby compared to seattle we flew into the airport just the number of high end luxury cars that i saw in the parking lot was quite mind boggling then to see the residential neighborhoods as you drive from the airport
1344416 this city is becoming very unaffordable for young people in particular you want to start a band you want to do film you want to have a high tech company you want to be engaged in civic and non profit work
1344417 vancouver is obviously becoming unaffordable for working families and that really worries me because at the same time vancouver is more affluent and has greater wealth it means that a lot of that creative and human energy needed to be successful cant afford to be here so i think thats a two headed monster i know that people in vancouver are thinking about it in comparison to the u s where they dont even think about it but i think its going to become an issue in the future
1344418 i think i made my case for urban planning in
1344419 many disagree with the work both from the right and the left
1344420 i think the best advice for planners though is that chapter in
1344421 the other thing it says for urban planners which is new for my work is that even though i rate and rank cities i think it says theres no single best city i think what it says is each city occupies its own niche for an individual theres a best city for you that could be a big city that could be a small town that could be a suburb that could be a rural area for urban planners its saying think about whats really unique about your community think about the kind of ways it can affect certain groups of people you dont have to be everything to everyone i think thats reasonably smart advice to really think about what your city and community has to offer and to focus on that
1344422 i only know enough to be dangerous so let me be dangerous and be suggestive without knowing the case and hoping to get to know the case of vancouver better over the next few months
1344423 first of all we always have to be wary of mega projects
1344424 one of the things we found from the people who study olympic bids and mega projects is that often those are one of a type one of a kind uses and that olympic architecture and stadiums dont fit in
1344425 people say london and barcelona have done a better job than many other cities so you need to pay attention to that and realize the olympics have to be part of your neighbourhood and community fabric
1344426 i worry a little about the creation of arts and culture districts
1344427 i would hope that vancouver creates markets for artists in any plan in vancouver i would encourage as much as possible support for the people actually making the art
1344428 a lot of my canadian colleagues say toronto is a lot like chicago or vancouver is a lot like seattle or san francisco we can actually look at these numbers and say if that true or not and how they are unique or different

1344480 marketing management macht erfolg der weg zur effizienz im marketing prozess
1344481 viele effizienzreserven werden gerade im marketing nicht aufgedeckt da sie sich implizit ber weite teile der gesch ftsprozesse hin erstrecken und nur auf genaue analyse hin sichtbar werden
1344482 die steuerung von marketing prozessen muss zur management aufgabe werden das marketing management ist ein sehr entscheidender wettbewerbsfaktor und als instrument langfristigen erfolgs ist es f r konzerne ebenso bedeutsam wie f r den mittelstand

1344494 for 100 more you could pick up an xbox 360 with tv and movie downloads direct to the console no pc required oh yeah you can do a bunch of other stuff too the second issue i have is that apple continues to lock us into their ecosystem a model that has worked well for them with audio but may not be as successful with video in the era of youtube and divx the itv has limited multimedia format support compared to products such as netgears new digital entertainer hd
1344495 this thing sucks and im not just saying that because im a media center user it just doesnt do much of anything that cant already be done with other products that have been out for years why cache on the hdd is your network not fast enough with 802 11n to get that done no pvr functionality tops out at 720p other than mac support i dont think this offers anything new sure its really the first device to play video purchased from itunes but thats about it
1344496 you can add other plain quicktime movies into your itunes library though but this is still very limited
1344497 if you want a more universal solution then the xbox 360
1344498 there was a lot of hype that the codenamed apple itv would revolutionize the tv industry

1344502 one reason were excited about the war is simply because of how good it is in my opinion its not only the best thing ken burns has done since the civil war its the best thing hes done ever
1344503 whats one thing that all caring environmentally conscious good hearted non evil people like
1344504 soulless republicans without life sentences but instead mercilessly hacked into a gooey pulp thats used as compost for victory gardens because the price of store bought food is so goddamn high
1344505 see unlike those dark age republicans we believe in real educational ref what the hell is that noise
1344506 oh thats just mathman taking his anger out on a roomful of nclb directives
1344507 i think we should get back to food because this is an issue that affects all americans suffering under deregulated agribusiness behemoths every single day
1344508 behemoths that pollute both the environment and our bodies leaving our souls starving as well
1344509 quite right im tired to stretching my food dollar to buy what is essentially poisonous crap that makes our kids all pissy and their bullshit is cutting into my toking time
1344510 we need to think of something thats satisfies both the health requirements of parents and the delicious flavor all children crave but what magical food contains both besides a pot in every chicken of course
1344511 you guys dont think its too heavy handed do you i mean everyone wants to be loved even voters

1344554 stop this runaway growth in state government that was under way
1344555 our goal continues to be to reduce the size of state government and we are going to continue as we have to make major progress in that direction and ive never said that theres some magic number that when you say you hit it youve done it
1344556 the strength of our results did surprise us though i think it shows that the childrens television standards should be updated to take that strength of community views into account
1344557 parents really feel strongly about their children seeing so much junk food advertising so they are really supportive of the government doing more in this area
1344558 with higher interest rates food costs and petrol prices many australians are struggling to make ends meet

1344825 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1344826 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1344827 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1344828 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease

1344876 were doing fine and have had a few players in and no big winners but its only monday
1344877 and weve actually seen some new customers come in to play
1344878 its going pretty well the biggest problem is explaining to customers how to play the game
1344879 but once they play a game they see how easy it is
1344880 i think its going to increase our business too once people realize they can play keno here as well as in west virginia

1344901 when i asked the city about it they said four fuel tanks had been found that would have to be cleaned out and capped
1344902 they kept running into these tanks and would call the fire inspector
1344903 we would check for any hazards each time most of the tanks were completely covered
1344904 were not planning to pull the tanks but kemron will probably spray them with a special cleaning solution then the solution will be sucked out and the tanks filled in with sand or some other material

1344914 gov arnold schwarzenegger and legislative leaders convened sunday night in hopes of ending a budget stalemate that is entering its sixth week but they made no progress and dispersed after less than two hours according to several participants
1344915 we have some big deep differences but at least we were together and well just keep working through it assembly republican leader
1344916 lawmakers have been at odds over how to close a 15 2 billion budget gap the largest since schwarzenegger took office in 2003 although the states fiscal morass has been apparent all year the pressure for a resolution is extreme now because the state could run out of money by the end of september unless a budget is passed
1344917 legislators officially return from their summer recess today with the state budget still unresolved and hundreds of bills pending adjournment is scheduled for aug 31 if the budget is done but democrats would like to finish up in time to attend the democratic national convention in denver on aug 25
1344918 thats the annual ritual in which one budget proposal after another is ceremoniously sacrificed on chamber floors until theres agreement on a single survivor
1344919 everybody dances around the fire they throw stuff at us we throw stuff at them everybody falls over dead and we start all over again is how a senior legislative staffer described it to me 15 years ago
1344920 todays legislators perry surmises have either forgotten the steps to the dance of death or theyre too scared to move
1344921 california lawmakers return from their summer break monday to deal with hundreds of bills in four hectic final weeks of their 2008 session
1344922 lawmakers are required to wrap up their 2008 regular session by aug 31 but schwarzenegger could call them into special session if they havent approved a budget by then
1344923 democrats have an incentive to finish their work early so they can attend their partys national convention which begins aug 25 in denver the republican convention starts sept 1 in minneapolis
1344924 besides instituting layoffs and a temporary pay cut the governor eliminated overtime and imposed a hard hiring freeze he allowed exemptions for crucial health and safety positions but also for those serving revenue producing functions providing leeway
1344925 when he signed his order thursday schwarzenegger said he wanted to save cash to ensure the state can pay its bills
1344926 we will execute this executive order and achieve savings we need to meet the states obligations said schwarzenegger press secretary aaron mclear
1344927 as gov arnold schwarzenegger and legislators confront a projected 15 2 billion budget deficit and weigh whether to impose new taxes to close it local governments throughout california are contemplating a wide array of new taxes to close their shortfalls or expand local services and facilities
1344928 wrangling in the capitol over a democratic plan to boost state taxes by more than 8 billion to close the states budget deficit and increasing political and legal battles over local taxes indicate that we may be nearing a climactic point in our seemingly endless political debate over what we want from government and how much were willing to pay for it
1344929 the sierra club and the planning and conservation league have not yet taken a position on proposition 1 which would authorize 9 95 billion in state borrowing to jump start the 800 mile rail
1344930 but environmentalists are still seething over the selection of relatively undeveloped pacheco pass as the route to connect the central valley to the bay area they favor the more urban altamont pass to the north because they say it would induce less sprawl
1344931 the planning and conservation league likes the concept but has continued to be quite concerned about the whole planning effort said gary patton the leagues lead lawyer
1344932 seeking to salvage two years of efforts to completely remake californias health insurance system gov arnold schwarzenegger and democratic legislators are nearing deals intended to rein in costly meager medical insurance policies sold directly to individuals
1344933 in the final weeks of the legislative session they are negotiating measures that would limit insurer profits on individual plans require plans to provide a minimum set of benefits and restrict insurers ability to cancel policies retroactively
1344934 the new focus reflects how far schwarzenegger remains from his original healthcare goal to orchestrate medical insurance for the 5 million californians who lack it
1344935 many of the concepts now under discussion were included in that proposal
1344936 three million californians buy health insurance on their own rather than through employers insurers keep premiums low and profits high their critics say on some individual policies by limiting the services they cover such plans may exclude prescription drugs and maternity services for example others may cover only hospital visits
1344937 states face a catch 22 when it comes to health policies that people buy on their own
1344938 we need to make the insurance market more user friendly
1344939 when i go out to talk to people about the legislative process corbett said in a recent interview and they say well the lobbyists have so much power because they have all this money i say no
1344940 statistics from the secretary of states office indicate there may be something to corbetts thesis
1344941 the number of registered lobbyists has increased from an estimated 870 at the end of the 1995 96 session to 1 075 at the end of the current session a 23 6 percent increase
1344942 the number of legislators meanwhile has remained fixed at 120 thats about a 9 to 1 ratio of lobbyists to lawmakers
1344943 the 17 to 20 lobbyists striving to kill 1313 and 1713 are part of
1344944 the more bodies we can throw at the train the greater chance we have of stopping it said tim shestek the sacramento based lobbyist for the american chemistry council who put together the coalition against 1713
1344945 possible theories include that natural hydrocarbons such as oil or gas are burning deep in the earth but nobody knows for sure what might have ignited the materials
1344946 we are a little perplexed at this point to tell you the truth said
1344947 yet his biggest fight may lie outside the ring where nash is confronting what to some is an opponent just as intimidating childhood bullying
1344948 hoping to prevent the kind of violence that has erupted on school campuses in recent years nash has developed his
1344949 so many people think that bullying is just a rite of passage nash said
1344950 this is all about whether the zoo is worth keeping and whether or not the community wants a great zoo and wants one for the future
1344951 there isnt a way for us to operate properly without this
1344952 well keep our fingers crossed and hope it doesnt become an issue

1345393 world snooker have wasted so much money on legal battles that were pointless that money could have been spent better like towards former players who needed it
1345394 i think it is diabolical the man pursued a career in snooker but now it looks like they are turning their backs on him which is such a shame

1345414 di kota jayapura ini sekitar 60 persen bagunan atau jumlahnya masih cukup banyak yang menempati daerah daerah terlarang atau rawan bencana dan mereka ini tidak bisa diberikan ijin karena memang tidak layak untuk diberikan ijin
1345415 sekalipun aturan dan hukum mengatakan bahwa mereka ini kena sangsi tetapi apakah kita mampu memberikan sangsi terhadap warga kota jayapura yang jumlahnya jauh lebih banyak yang tidak mengikuti aturan dari pada warga yang memenuhi aturan
1345416 kota jayapura sebagai ibu kota propinsi papua dengan topografi yang bervariasi ditinjau dari segi tempat pemukiman penduduk tentu sangat terbatas saat ini boleh dikatakan sudah sangat padat bahkan sudah melebihi dari kapasitasnya atau daya dukungnya
1345417 apalagi menjelang musim hujan kondisi tanah yang terbuka sudah tidak mempunyai daya resapan dan tidak mampu menahan aliran air sehingga mengakibatkan bencana
1345418 kota jayapura yang begitu sempit semakin tahun semakin bertambah penduduknya segala kegiatan usaha dan jasa serta kegiatan peningkatan sumber daya manusia semuanya berpusat di kota jayapuara ini sehingga keadaan tersebut otomatis mempengaruhi terhadap pertambahan penduduk maupun bagunan secara terus menerus yang mengakibatkan padatnya pemukimanan penduduk sampai saat ini
1345419 permukiman yang kian hari kian bertambah sirkulasi dan mobilisasi kendaraan sekarang ini juga sudah cukup padat hal ini memberikan suatu peringatan bagi kita bahwa kota jayapura ini mestinya perlu dirancang bagaimana pengembangannya serta tata letak tempat tempat pemukiman masyarakat
1345420 hanya saja jarak antara antara koya barat dan koya timur dengan pusat pusat kegiatan kota jayapura yang cukup jauh dimana jalanan yang masih cukup jauh serta kurangnya faktor penunjang pada lokasi tersebut serta mobilisasi kedaerah tersebut dan juga belum sepenuhnya menunjang sehingga penduduk daerah tersebut masih kurang dan orang masih lebih memilih kota jayapura sebagai tempat tujuan utamanya untuk bermukim
1345421 bangunan bangunan di lokasi seperti itu memang tidak memiliki ijin mendirikan bagunan dan itu telah diingatkan kalau membangun permukiman di daerah semacam ini tidak boleh
1345422 saya heran kenapa terlalu banyak ruko di kota jayapura ini
1345423 banyak bangunan rumah yang berdiri megah di kemiringan dengan elevasi 45 derajat ini sangat berbahaya dan tidak diperbolehkan
1345424 bahkan peristiwa setahun lalu 2006 kawasan cyklops mengamuk dan beberapa jembatan di sentani pun putus
1345425 kalau tidak memasukan keseimbangan alam dan melanggar aturan maka petaka yang bisa diterima
1345426 menanggapi soal tudingan pemerintah kota jayapura kurang tegas menurut kepala dinas tata kota jayapura ir agustinus sapang sebenarnya pihak pemerintah kota hanya mampu menindak rumah rumah yang dibangun kalau memiliki sertifikat yang sah
1345427 sebenarnya permukiman yang berada di kawasan perbukitan dengan kemiringan 30 tidak memiliki sertifikat dan mereka memperoleh ijin dari masyarakat adat pemilik tanah jadi agak sulit untuk mengontrol dan menindak
1345428 apalagi kawasan itu merupakan wilayah konservasi sehingga tidak cocok untuk mendirikan bangunan
1345429 permukiman ini sudah ada sebelum terbentuknya kota jayapura sehingga tampaknya perkembangan kota ini sejak awal sudah tak bisa dikendalikan lagi

1345442 17th april 1623 the first thursday after palm sunday there was in the morning a solemn procession of the blessed sacrament participating in it were the the entire clergy and there were allegorical representations of the mysteries by persons in desguise some dressed as animals and dances and mascarades things which in our country are fitter for the village than a great city
1345443 however the council does not object to dances or interludes in which men appear in seemly garb going before the crucifixes and biers of saints of both sexes
1345444 the ama is proud to support research about the history of the racial divide in organized medicine because by confronting the past we can embrace the future
1345445 the ama is committed to improving its relationship with minority physicians and to increasing the ranks of minority physicians so that the workforce accurately represents the diversity of americas patients
1345446 five years ago the ama joined with the national medical association and the national hispanic medical association to create the commission to end health care disparities
1345447 our goal is to identify and study racial and ethnic health care disparities in order to eradicate them we strongly support the doctors back to school program which the ama founded to inspire minority students to become the next generation of minority physicians

1345452 at the end of the sermon an illuminited proscenium opens and the congregation beholds various figures representing stages of our lords passion in accord with the subject of the sermon so one day it is the ecce homo another the lord bearing the cross and lastly the cricifixion all times these figures are made to move and turn and at the ecce homo the tunic slips off to display the wounded body at the sight men and women break into loud cries and the ladies are so zealous that not content with crying out themselves they compel their maid servants to do it aloud willy nilly even if they must give them blows in the church itself verily a curious sort of piety

1345466 the influence of polling location on voting found in our research would be more than enough to change the outcome of a close election
1345467 voting at a school could increase support for school spending or voting at a church could decrease support for stem cell initiatives
1345468 environmental cues such as objects or places can activate related constructs within individuals and influence the way they behave
1345469 voting in a school for example could activate the part of a persons identity that cares about kids or norms about taking care of the community similarly voting in a church could activate norms of following church doctrine such effects may even occur outside an individuals awareness
1345470 we want factors like political views whether someone thinks a candidate is going to make our country a better place to sway elections
1345471 but in forming election policy we also want to make sure that arbitrary factors such as polling location dont ultimately influence voting behaviors

1345477 the consequences of the sexualization of girls in media today are very real and are likely to have a negative influence on girls healthy development
1345478 we have ample evidence to conclude that sexualization has negative effects in a variety of domains including cognitive functioning physical and mental health and healthy sexual development
1345479 dissatisfaction with their bodies often seems to originate from or is certainly accentuated by celebrity culture and the print media and magazines young girls and women are very aware of pressures from the media around body image and appearance
1345480 as a society we need to replace all of these sexualized images with ones showing girls in positive settings ones that show the uniqueness and competence of girls
1345481 the goal should be to deliver messages to all adolescents boys and girls that lead to healthy sexual development

1345520 i think medvedev is trying to weaken the people who dont suit him in putins circle
1345521 there is a disagreement about how relations should be with business and how to conduct foreign policy this division exists and the question now is whether it can be managed or whether it will grow
1345522 this is the first time that the president has strongly and clearly opposed putins line
1345523 what medvedev said is correct from the perspective of economics on the other hand the business elite doesnt really believe that he is the full fledged president but this is a first step that shows that he is becoming president and that is good
1345524 in the eyes of the public putin is being active strict masculine tough and decisive most voters like this after all who likes the rich they like to see another fat cat put in his place
1345525 the fact that this harms the stock markets causes the oil companies to lose money and harms investment projects in our country doesnt occur to them
1345526 putin is openly and publicly declaring that he is the main figure on the political map and its clear that medvedev still lacks either the resources courage or political experience to answer him forcefully
1345527 putin is now attacking but medvedev is not simply stepping quietly aside he feels the obligation to resist but softly he is not doing this directly but more like acting like a servant in a play by molieres or shakespeare who is whispering an aside while his master is speaking
1345528 i think in the short term they will manage and regulate this disagreement and move it to the back burner but i think in the long term this disagreement can only grow
1345529 there are two ways this could turn out either there will be a big fight one of the two will win and we will return to having a single administrative center or they will find a compromise that says vladimir vladimirovich putin this is your area this is dmitry anatolyevichs medvedev

1345582 endometriosis occurs when cells of the inner lining of the womb are found growing outside of the uterus
1345583 we found the telomere a region at the end of all chromosomes that prevents the chromosome destroying itself during cell division is abnormally long in women with endometriosis
1345584 our research shows however that cells in the lining of the womb are unique in that they can express this enzyme in the early stages of the menstrual cycle when cell division is important but not during the latter stages when implantation of the fertilised embryo becomes a priority
1345585 women who have endometriosis express this enzyme in both the early and late stages of the menstrual cycle which means that the cells will continue to divide and lose their focus in supporting the establishment of a pregnancy as a result the lining of the womb may be more hostile to an early pregnancy and the cells that are shed at this late stage in the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive and more able to survive and implant outside the uterus causing pain in the pelvic or abdomen area

1345588 the interpreter seated closest to siddiqui lunged at her and pushed the rifle away as siddiqui pulled the trigger siddiqui fired at least two shots but no one was hit the warrant officer returned fire with a 9 mm service pistol and fired approximately two rounds at siddiquis torso hitting her at least once

1345609 as china overtook the u s in february to become the worlds largest internet market with 221 million users the launch of jiapu cn is perfectly timed both to generate interest in and lead the online family history category in china
1345610 launching a chinese family history website also represents a unique opportunity for ancestry to extend its global reach to those in the many chinese communities around the world who may already have access to the eight ancestry international websites but not to chinese records
1345611 interest in family history has grown significantly in the past decade thanks to the internet which has made it possible for people to gain access to billions of historical records from the comfort of their own homes
1345612 with chinas clear sense and respect for its own historical identity we anticipate that many people of chinese heritage will enthusiastically take up researching their own roots and in doing so make new connections around the world

1345635 the idea of giving a reaganesque tear down this wall speech on human rights in china as members of congress and others are calling for mr bush to do has been abandoned as potentially insulting to the presidents hosts
1345636 the chinese people are watching very carefully about the decisions by world leaders and i happen to believe that not going to the opening ceremony for the games would be an affront to the chinese people which may make it more difficult to be able to speak frankly with the chinese leadership
1345637 i know its important for me to send a clear signal to the chinese people that we respect them
1345638 does anyone understand why obama suggesting that people keep their tires properly inflated is some sort of hilarious gaffe

1345674 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay
1345675 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1345676 we talked to a couple people already they said its not supposed to be so bad i dont know what so bad is seventy mile per hour winds sounds bad to me
1345677 he knew how to bring together orchestra and singing doing everything possible to bring out the best singing performance
1345678 it is not by chance that he worked with callas when she had her small vocal problems
1345679 he was of the old school he knew the repertoire backwards
1345680 he could solve any problem because he knew the subject really well
1345681 adjust the sound the orchestra the timing the dynamics to the conditions of any given night this is something that old time directors could do really well
1345682 this removes the distinction between time and space and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state
1345683 they told you to get out down to the concourse because of bad weather
1345684 a lot of games out here and ive never heard that before ive never heard that boomer go out across the street
1345685 ive been coming out here for 30 years ive never seen anything like it
1345686 at least they told us to get out they warned us and told us to get going
1345687 the rain started coming down they started covering the field and about 10 minutes later they asked us to move towards cover and then we started hearing the tornado sirens go off
1345688 it was pretty cramped down there the whole terminal was down there
1345689 i dont think anything will be getting out of chicago tonight
1345690 the wind picked up and in probably five seconds it blew my friend into her husband
1345691 he grabbed her and pulled her inside and we all ran down the stairs it was like dead still and then within five seconds 10 seconds we were all blown away
1345692 we have about 270 crews out theyve been working throughout the night
1345693 as of this point weve restored power to 165 000 customers but the work will continue 24 hours until we get this done
1345694 at this point were still saying its a multiple day restoration were asking a lot of our customers to be patient as we work on clearing all the damage and restoring power
1345695 well get a better idea as work goes throughout the day on the extent of damage and then have a better idea on when the last customer will be restored

1345698 walon robert nooch michael chernuchin and i have been working together for most of the last two decades
1345699 between them they have written hundreds of episodes of the brands various iterations by joining ci they are providing the best of both worlds a new perspective and a wealth of experience with the brand john coles is one of the most respected producer directors on the east coast i could not ask for a better team as we embark on our eighth season
1345700 law amp order criminal intent has been a great success in its move to usa
1345701 we are excited to have this wonderfully talented and experienced team at the helm and are looking forward to fresh takes on the shows creative as we head into season eight
1345702 theres a strange irony to it because as far back as more than a year there were a number of communications with the key person in programming at cbs regarding my series
1345703 i will be the last person to suggest that they got the idea for the mentalist from my pilot which had been well constructed and worked on for almost two years
1345704 as a matter of fact having seen the cbs pilot some months ago i would say it is more similar to the cable series
1345705 the appeal on one level involves ridicule and laughing at the other but i think some of the shows are also about survival in almost an apocalyptic sense they ask the question are you tough enough to survive in these post 9 11 times
1345706 abc wanted to create a family show that had all the fun of fear factor without the grossness on fear factor though we tried to have the contestants achieve a 50 percent success rate here its more like 10 percent viewers dont want to see people succeed
1345707 the simpler the stunt the better the wipeout will be the best is when someone hits something then bounces off or ricochets and falls into the water
1345708 it has a consistency that stays thick all day when you hit it it absorbs the impact
1345709 i actually had an advantage because i am a total you tube fanatic and i had watched japanese game shows via you tube or even on ellen
1345710 so i already had an idea of the madness we were about to get into and the silliness but you know you can only imagine so much
1345711 i have been kind of fascinated and intrigued by the culture since i studied acting in college it was like all of my wildest fantasies coming true i never thought i would actually go to japan
1345712 that girl is hysterical shes genuine shes just amazing she inspired me a lot we didnt get to have a lot of conversation but the conversations we did have were just so real she is a fierce
1345713 they did okay as most of the theme parks did in lieu of vacation and better than a stay cation suburbanites will take their kids to an amusement park and thats what they did in the second quarter
1345714 because carlos solis her husband is blind and shes had two kids and shes let go of that vanity i love it because my hair and make up only takes ten minutes rather than the usual two hours
1345715 ive been cooking and eating cooking and eating ive eaten pretty much everything in sight
1345716 theres always something people are asking you when youre dating someone its when are you going to get married then you get married and its whens the baby then you have a baby and its whens the divorce so i guess i should count myself lucky were still at the whens the baby stage
1345717 youll be seeing eva for at least this first eight episodes
1345718 thats what we are looking at this being an art for her and then whether we continue to have her in parts in the back 13 is still up for debate
1345719 the ideal of eureka was that you bring together all these great minds and let them just sort of work and explore and see what they come up with versus if you come in with a mandate and say now you have to actually produce something and you have to be physically reasonable
1345720 what kind of impact does that have and do you get competition for those grant funds do you get people cutting corners you know going to great lengths to impress so that they dont lose their jobs and those are definitely some of the things that we explore this season with evas character
1345721 eva s kind of a master manipulator too so you never quite know what her i mean shes someone whos come here with a real agenda and a job to do but she also has a hidden agenda a secret which is sort of the methodology for this season and thats the thing that you know you never quite which you know which way shes playing people if its genuine or not

1345727 theres no rumor about me that show is already filming and besides i have a contract with somebody else
1345728 it was pretty cramped down there the whole terminal was down there
1345729 they tried very hard to convict him up here they spared no resources and it didnt work

1345739 its a little bit cooler than it has been over the last few years and a bit wetter this year particularly in july and that means people are using their heaters more
1345740 because it has been damp and cold people are drying clothes inside they are overloading power points because there are two or three heaters on them and its just all those factors that mean we have got more risk of fires
1345741 all these other fires unless you get a fatality does not make statewide media
1345742 house fires attract attention in a local paper but people dont necessarily read it and if they do they think it wasnt me and it doesnt affect me

1345745 only three in 10 ballarat babies are still breastfed at 10 months and breastfeeding at discharge two weeks three months and six months rank below grampians region averages as well as both rural and metro averages
1345746 we certainly need to be doing better than this and this project and launch today will help us to improve our rankings on that table
1345747 theres a lot of uncertainty for manufacturing around the emissions trading scheme and other regulations introduced by the new government
1345748 but compared to the other states in victoria were doing quite well
1345749 while it may not affect a lot of companies in ballarat directly it will definitely affect every business indirectly
1345750 at this stage its a very slow pace of going in either direction
1345751 we shouldnt have to create a new system when theyre chw taking the existing water to ballarat
1345752 if this is to continue its about time ballarat should pay for it

1345763 i was a good student so i was hoping to pass
1345764 but i definitely didnt have expectations of doing this well so i was pretty excited
1345765 the foster school prepared me really well for the exam in a couple of ways
1345766 it helped develop my work ethic so that when it came time to study for the exam i was already used to working really hard
1345767 also a lot of the cpa exam is academic conceptual work experience helps but academic experience is really valuable on the exam and i felt like i had great preparation at the uw my classmates were great to work with the atmosphere was the right mix of competition and collaboration and the faculty were great very knowledgeable and helpful

1345769 its important to help people understand what a single study means and doesnt mean
1345770 children who experience hostility abuse physical discipline and other aggressive behaviors by their parents are more likely to model that behavior in their peer relationships
1345771 children learn from their parents how to behave and interact with others
1345772 so if theyre learning about aggression and angry words at home they will tend to use these behaviors as coping mechanisms when they interact with their peers

1345784 elastra has an experienced team with a unique software approach that helps enterprise companies realize the benefits of cloud computing
1345785 we took a hard look at the value businesses see in cloud computing it was clear that enterprises need a complete and integrated way to manage entire applications in cloud environments we feel elastra has set their sights on the right segment of the market enterprises whose applications need a holistic architected approach to managing cloud based systems rather than libraries of machines that are tied together with random scripts
1345786 elastras management team consists of seasoned professionals with an enterprise software background who have built software companies before we are excited to back this group and support them in bringing their product to an untapped and eager market segment
1345787 enterprises are moving into the cloud and understand its financial value but they need software that lets them deploy and manage applications that meet complex requirements creating this software and doing it right requires a lot of work from many talented people i am happy to rely on the backing of such outstanding investors and market pioneers as elastra delivers the product functionality and robustness our customers demand

1345908 during the season we are bound to suffer setbacks every team does
1345909 there will be injuries loss of form red cards and clearly we need luck at crucial times as well but hopefully we will end up in the right place
1345910 it is almost too tight to split them and results over the last few years confirm that
1345911 in the last three or four years it has been chelsea and manchester united going for the title
1345912 but liverpool won the champions league then lost the final a couple of years later arsenal have been in it as well
1345913 you can see from our results in europe how much quality there is in the premier league so i expect us all to be quite close to each other
1345914 a lot of people say that i should have gone to united instead but i had already had two meetings with juventus before united came in

1345940 der druck auf die logistik und transportunternehmen wird auch in zukunft enorm steigen das ziel muss es daher sein die logistik dahingehend zu optimieren dass das gleiche volumen mit weniger bewegung transportiert wird
1345941 die volumen und gr enangaben beruhen allerdings h ufig auf ungenauen sch tzungen der auftraggeber mit automatischen scanner und wiegesystemen l sst sich aber das genaue volumen von paketen bestimmen so dass transportfahrzeuge und flugzeuge effektiver beladen werden k nnen
1345942 das vor rund dreieinhalb jahren gegr ndete verbundprojekt geht jetzt in eine weitere phase
1345943 schl sselkomponente des gesamten systems ist eine hochtemperatur membran zur bereitstellung von reinem sauerstoff
1345944 uns ist es gelungen eine hochtemperatur membran technik zu entwickeln mit deren hilfe der reine sauerstoff bei vergleichsweise niedrigen temperaturen von etwa 850 grad celsius gewonnen werden kann
1345945 das co2 aus dem rauchgas kann mit hoher wirkung ausgeschieden werden
1345946 nachdem wir in der ersten phase das membranmodul entwickelt und das verfahren optimiert haben testen wir in den n chsten drei jahren das zusammenspiel der komponenten in unserer pilotanlage
1345947 we want to apologize to our loyal customers and express our appreciation for their patience by giving all current subscribers an automatic 30 day extension to their mobileme subscription free of charge
1345948 we have recently completed the transition from mac to mobileme unfortunately it was a lot rockier than we had hoped
1345949 another snag we have run into is our use of the word
1345950 i just spent the better part of an hour going through apples phone support maze only to be told that we are basically all hosed for at least a week if you are a mac user and are trying to publish iweb content via this mobileme ss you can forget about it for now it doesnt work period there are huge bugs and apple is well aware of them
1345951 we understand this is a serious issue and apologize for this service interruption we are working hard to restore your service
1345952 thank you all for your extreme patience during this trying time by completing this restoration of mail services we hope we have put the vast majority of mobileme mail problems behind us and can now focus on improving other aspects of this new ambitious service
1345953 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1345954 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year
1345955 delta remains committed to providing a travel experience that maximizes the time our customers spend with us onboard by offering them even more productivity options our customers asked for in flight connectivity and were responding by rolling out the most extensive wi fi network in the sky beginning this fall our passengers will have the ability to stay connected when they travel with us throughout the continental u s

1345958 will then purchase the remaining interest from bertelsmann for approximately 600 million as a result bertelsmann will receive approximately 900 million in value for its 50 percent stake plus 300 million of its share of cash on sony bmgs balance sheet
1345959 this move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas
1345960 sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential
1345961 music has been a vital and vibrant part of sonys culture for over 20 years this acquisition will allow us to achieve a deeper and more robust integration between the wide ranging global assets of the music company and sonys products operating companies and affiliates
1345962 the many new distribution paths are causing an increase in the demand for music use rights
1345963 we invited all the outfielders who played a certain number of games he definitely was invited
1345964 we would love for him to come he was definitely a big part of this organization
1345965 we look forward to put in place new authorities to improve confidence and stability in markets
1345966 intended to keep more deserving american families in their homes
1345967 providing authority to the secretary of the treasury to extend credit or to buy stock is one that will end up costing the taxpayers tens of billions of dollars
1345968 its only a matter of how much the taxpayers are going to lose
1345969 your reply of grow up shows to me that you are already out of date we are the most educated group the us has ever had we collaborate integrate and update faster then any group ever
1345970 in a cost constrained it budget scenario cios will most likely look to cut their resources first from lower value augmented contract it staff
1345971 we hire five work them like ten and pay them like eight
1345972 this years cipd conference falls just at the moment when the full impact of the credit crunch and the fuel and food price squeezes will start to emerge
1345973 under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis
1345974 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1345975 the new plan is really just a lot of words warmed over
1345976 its easy to try to hide behind the words but the reality is barack obama is not leading on this issue
1345977 recovered this rather nebulous bit of information is the only thing ive heard about the whole ordeal leaving many questions unanswered does anyone care to fill us all in uh rick
1345978 my grandfather and many other relatives were in the gulag and it was very important for me that he opened up this world
1345979 he was an intellectual colossus he did so much for russia
1345980 he was the second tolstoy and the greatest man of truth concerning russias history in the 20th century he gathered so much material on the experiences of people in the camps and opened our eyes to the terrible things that took place on our land
1345981 it was such a help for us my mothers first husband was killed in the camps and thats why solzhenitsyn is so important for our family
1345982 i have kept those pages of the journal with me all these years even when it was forbidden to have them by the soviet authorities he will forever remain in my memory
1345983 the problems have been difficult weve all heard the reactions of head teachers and weve heard the apologies from the qca and their contractor and theyve acknowledged the reputational damage
1345984 but it still remains the case that ofqual are advising us that the quality of marking is as good as its been in previous years
1345985 there are always reviews and appeals that happens every year i have confidence in these figures that we are putting out today
1345986 compared to 1997 101 000 more 11 year olds are now achieving the target level for their age in english and 93 000 more in maths
1345987 these are alarming figures suggesting that fewer pupils are achieving excellence and that pupils are not being stretched to the best of their abilities
1345988 the shambles surrounding the marking of this years tests are a disgrace 460 schools still do not have results for all of their pupils
1345989 this year as every year the results are based on a statistically robust sample any claims that not all the results are available and therefore they should not be published should be dismissed as ill informed nonsense
1345990 i have no doubt however that the serial detractors who rush every year to criticise the outcome of the tests will once again be much in evidence
1345991 instead of publishing the results the government should have taken the opportunity to ask lord sutherland to conduct a fundamental review of the entire flawed testing system
1345992 criticising the publishing of the sats results shows a lack of understanding of statistical theory with almost complete returns the results are reliable at a national level
1345993 when i go out my door now i dont see anyone i know i see the loss of a community
1345994 i doubt well get rooney fit for the start of the season with the virus hes had
1345995 its a virus he picked up in nigeria and its not a nice one but quite a few have had it its such a bad virus and hes got to be training to be fit
1345996 i dont know whether we will have a team ready
1345997 nani is suspended anderson is in the olympic games michael carricks come in this morning and he may play a part of the game on sunday
1345998 the matter is closed now he is a manchester united player its finished he is going to play here believe me
1345999 its had a bit of a rough time in the states its opening against one of the highest grossing movies batman
1346000 people in the states are so used to lots of cgi action and sex and we dont really offer a lot of that in this film
1346001 i was hoping to reinvigorate the egg cream phenom that existed in the early 1900s maybe every diner and soda shop will have it
1346002 i wanted to reintroduce the egg cream to a whole generation of people
1346003 the elevated acre is a rooftop plaza offering stunning views of the east river the brooklyn heights esplanade red hook and the old ferry terminal a seven leveled concrete amphitheater with a sloping lushly landscaped garden the acre like the selection of movies screened this summer is imaginatively conceived

1346011 with a little more luck i might have been able to ask you to be my vice president
1346012 he has his mother join him and they talked to neighbors who were able to identify an apartment of the suspect
1346013 that information was provided to the montclair police department a follow up investigation confirmed his involvement and he was arrested
1346014 it was pretty cramped down there the whole terminal was down there
1346015 its easy to get intimidated but its so much fun to do with your friends and just go out there and be in the ocean
1346016 from 01 to 05 pretty much the amount of surfers in the water stayed static but the women populous grew by about 33 percent
1346017 i have moms that drop their kids off at my surf camp and then they go down and surf on their own and come back at the end of the day and pick their kids up
1346018 similar to yoga a lot of people that do yoga are taking up surfing because i think they find the same type of spiritual feeling along with the workout theyre getting

1346021 energy has become a pivotal issue in this increasingly competitive election as voters fret over high gas prices which have hovered around 4 a gallon and their impact on food and transportation costs
1346022 sen mccain has successfully seized on the issue to gain ground against sen obama who continues to lead in most polls

1346031 the journalists talked much about their expeditions in the county and one of the touring journalists kate hazell of itp a media group with over 200 publications that covers most countries in the middle east was overwhelmed by the tourism packages which the country has on offer

1346033 gave speeches on the empty floor to protest that congress went into recess and to raise awareness of what they say is an unwillingness by democrats to take up legislation to deal with the nations energy crisis
1346034 nadeam elshami a spokesman for speaker nancy pelosi d calif chalked the display up to politics
1346035 studying in a mixed environment is the reason behind the increase in this problem
1346036 i am going to lead our nation to energy independence and im going to do it with a realistic and comprehensive all of the above approach that uses every resource available to finally solve this crisis
1346037 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1346038 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1346039 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1346040 apple is certainly trying but i just dont think given the lack of a qwerty keyboard that youre going to see the iphone supplant the blackberry in terms of usage in the enterprise
1346041 particularly in the bay area thats been at amp ts cross to bear
1346042 its cobbled together a network of cellularone which is terrible and a few others its not the greatest coverage
1346043 will then purchase the remaining interest from bertelsmann for approximately 600 million as a result bertelsmann will receive approximately 900 million in value for its 50 percent stake plus 300 million of its share of cash on sony bmgs balance sheet
1346044 this move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas
1346045 sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential
1346046 music has been a vital and vibrant part of sonys culture for over 20 years this acquisition will allow us to achieve a deeper and more robust integration between the wide ranging global assets of the music company and sonys products operating companies and affiliates
1346047 the many new distribution paths are causing an increase in the demand for music use rights
1346048 in view of this fact we believe that building a business for the management and exploitation of such rights in europe is an attractive proposition we want to take advantage of our opportunities and position ourselves with the strong well established bmg brand and a management that is highly regarded in the market
1346049 now we know brother obama but i tell you what if he comes to power come november and he doesnt start pulling troops out of afghanistan i know a lot of people who are gonna stand up and burn down every office of every senate

1346051 i believe that marriages that have been entered into subsequent to the may 15 supreme court opinion will be recognized by the california supreme court
1346052 i would think the court in looking at the underlying equities would most probably conclude that upholding the marriages performed in that interval before the election would be a just result
1346053 the groups fault justice brent benjamin for remaining on the case after don blankenship masseys president chairman and chief executive officer spent more than 3 million to help him win his seat
1346054 the improper appearance created by money in judicial elections is one of the most important issues facing our judicial system today
1346055 a line needs to be drawn somewhere to prevent a judge from hearing cases involving a person who has made massive campaign contributions to benefit the judge we certainly believe that in this case acting chief justice benjamin crossed that line
1346056 it has long been recognized that there is a presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators
1346057 due process therefore requires recusal only in those rare cases wherein a judge or justice has a direct personal substantial or pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case

1346068 later on he reckoned that what he really was looking for was someone to pay him to do and say what he wanted to do and say slowly he learned that that isnt freedom that freedom is not something you find or someone gives you it is something you assume and then you wait for someone to come and take it away from you the amount of resistance you put up is the amount of freedom you will have

1346076 well brian youre right i dont normally speak to pastors actually i was thinking about that very question yesterday when i was in a large bookstore i asked the bookstore manager what the most popular books are these days most popular he said were books about how to get rich in the new information economy which didnt surprise me second most popular the manager said were books about spirituality and in particular books about buddhism and so when i thought about speaking to five hundred christian pastors today i thought id begin by asking you all a question why are books on buddhism so popular and not books on christianity
1346077 i think its because buddhism presents itself as a way of life and christianity presents itself as a system of belief so i would want to get christian ministers thinking about how to rediscover their own faith as a way of life because thats what people are searching for today thats what they need most
1346078 it is good to have holy places in the world and it is good for us to go on pilgrimages to visit a place is minor to change within yourself is greater when it comes to the sacred sites its better to be a pilgrim than a tourist
1346079 unfortunately in this election senator mccain has proposed an energy plan thats nothing but four years more of the same
1346080 he didnt answer the question when listening to surrogates or attack dogs
1346081 hes not going to use gop style character assassination period but he needs more positive ads for the olympics its a risk for sure but its more risky to jump on a mud fight like karl rove wants
1346082 theres no question that the downturn in the economy is dramatically impacting those at the doorstep of retirement and those that have already decided to retire

1346131 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1346132 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1346133 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1346134 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america

1346136 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1346137 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1346138 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1346139 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1346140 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1346141 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1346142 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1346143 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1346144 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1346145 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1346146 in themselves limits on offshore drilling are only a modest sized issue
1346147 its true that scientists dont know exactly how much world temperatures will rise if we persist with business as usual but that uncertainty is actually what makes action so urgent while theres a chance that well act against global warming only to find that the danger was overstated theres also a chance that well fail to act only to find that the results of inaction were catastrophic which risk would you rather run
1346148 there are a dizzying number of economic and national security arguments for drilling at home a 700 billion oil balance of payments deficit a gas tax equivalent levied on the paychecks of american workers and poured into the treasuries of enemy and terror supporting regimes growing dependence on unstable states of the persian gulf and caspian basin
1346149 they seem blissfully unaware that the argument for their drill there not here policy collapses on its own environmental terms
1346150 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1346151 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

1346179 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1346180 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1346181 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1346182 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1346183 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1346184 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1346185 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1346186 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1346187 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1346188 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1346189 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1346190 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1346191 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1346192 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1346193 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1346194 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1346195 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1346196 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1346197 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1346198 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1346199 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1346200 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1346201 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1346202 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1346203 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1346204 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1346205 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1346206 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1346207 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1346208 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1346209 blah i exist outside of society my brain is mush
1346210 you know what i do want babies and im not ashamed to say it i like to cook and knit and sew and make my house homey and all those girly things that feminism taught us were below our intelligence
1346211 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1346212 he has image problems because nobody in hollywood really knows him
1346213 our business plan is not so much about the movie business
1346214 its really to build a global digital distribution business its based on the expectation that in the not too distant future most content will be delivered digitally and on demand
1346215 bergstein stayed with us we never shut down for a day everybody got paid
1346216 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1346217 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1346218 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1346219 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1346220 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1346221 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1346222 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1346223 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1346224 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1346225 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1346226 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1346227 who are open to doing something on the production side
1346228 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1346229 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1346230 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1346231 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1346232 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1346233 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1346234 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1346235 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

1346249 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1346250 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1346251 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1346252 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1346253 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1346254 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1346255 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1346256 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1346257 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1346258 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1346259 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1346260 think about what goes through their minds when they see us holding a cigarette in a bar drinking and disrespecting women or ourselves throwing cigarettes in urinals what do our youth think when they see this

1346366 cause why would i show love to the game the game dont show you love back so i wasnt gonna do that and come back out and mess up my image and mess up myself i was going on the strength that i want respect from people who probably dont like me anyway so im gonna stick to what i do and stay being successful and ill do some mixtapes and some futures something like that

1346369 the bio is concerned with reportage facts analysis chronology and logic jerome bruner called such thinking paradigmatic we find it in textbooks editorials news stories academic papers articles even in the talk of children trying to persuade their parents that they should be able to go swimming on the first day the pool is open even though it is sixty two degrees and windy paradigmatic thinking is all around us and its indispensable but it isnt the only way to think although it might appear so given the emphasis that secondary schools and higher education give it
1346370 after junior high school sometimes before school is devoted to teaching students to think paradigmatically the predominant mode of writing is exposition so the irony persists that while teachers might read plenty of imaginative literature even revere it as some of the best work people have produced they funnel students writing in its opposite direction

1346486 retire at age 65 with a personal net worth of 200 000 and
1346487 one thing im noticing is when i intentionally do a query that is one letter off and then click on the google
1346488 it appears to me that google has rolled back its index i am seeing thousands of old 301 html pages from back in april from our old site that have not been in the index for 2 months now right back at the top of the serps we also in may refined a sub link structure on our new site that successfully re weighted our more important pages the pages are weighted back to where they were prior to our changes this may be why some that were hit in june are back in business
1346489 still looking at other datacenters and the results dont match wonder why the dcs are out of sync maybe since they lifted penalties they are doing some mvt to see what the new results are like before they sync the dcs
1346490 i just lost a 2 and a 6 there yesterday gone today the 2 still shows up in ca co uk and other european data centers naturally these two were my top 2 traffic generators have a 4 thats still there at least for the moment
1346491 rocco i wonder if our site have any similarities my site is a user submitted link list search engine with dynamic pages i also have reciprocal linking to my site the content on may pages changes weekly but about half of the page content stays that same maybe we can figure this out
1346492 looks as if weve lost even more traffic now were down another 20 25 last month was our worse month in 1 5 years so far this month were continuing the downward spiral
1346493 this is very interesting to know i own two sites that run this way and are both yo yoing with these penalties every year my oldest site was before google was king and is meant to be user friendly and not to play the seo game both site have thousands of outbound and inbound reciprocal links i know my biggest competitor dont seem to be effected much by these penalties and their site is run the same way they even have double the amount of link exchanges the only real thing i can see different from their site to mine it they have triple the amount of pages and new content added weekly not just new submitted links after this latest change i also noticed that links command shows a lower link count then before july 30th even my competitors are showing lower inbound links but it didnt seem to affect them like it did my sites one thing i was thinking was maybe it was caused by my page content not changing enough one about 70 of my pages half of the page stays the same because of sponsor advertising and the bottom half shows newly added submitted link content i was thinking the google bot was only scanning so deep on these pages and maybe thinking none of the page content changed

1346697 the most startling revelation from this intelligence success story was that the anthrax program had been developed in parallel to 9 11 planning as best as we could determine project had been wrapped up in the summer of 2001 when the al qaida deputy along with hambali were briefed over a week by sufaat on the progress he had made to isolate anthrax the entire operation had been managed at the top of with strict compartmentalization having completed this phase of his work sufaat fled afghanistan in december 2001 and was captured by authorities trying to sneak back into malaysia rauf ahmad was detained by pakistani authorities in december 2001 our hope was that these and our many other actions had neutralized the anthrax threat at least temporarily

1346713 de nederlaag tegen bate was voor de hele groep een schok
1346714 we waren de grote favoriet voor de match maar negentig minuten later waren we wel heel ver verwijderd van de kwalificatie
1346715 we moeten absoluut snel scoren voor mijn part valt het tweede doelpunt in de laatste seconde zolang we zelf geen doelpunt binnenkrijgen is het goed
1346716 het wordt een wedstrijd met het mes op de keel
1346717 ik heb nog altijd het gevoel dat we ons kunnen kwalificeren omdat ik weet dat we beter zijn dan bate borisov
1346718 na de heenmatch was ik geschrokken ja iedereen was geschrokken maar alles zat ons ook tegen in die wedstrijd hopelijk zit het ons deze keer wel mee want dit is een erg belangrijke match voor anderlecht
1346719 dit wordt erg belangrijk voor de toekomst niet alleen van anderlecht maar ook van het belgische voetbal
1346720 als we niet doorgaan dan gaat de coeffici nt omlaag en daar kunnen we vijf jaar de gevolgen van dragen

1346740 our countries are neighbors condemned to live alongside each other they are separated however more by social economic and psychic differences than by physical frontiers
1346741 the really fundamental difference is an invisible one and in addition it is probably insuperable to prove that it has nothing to do with economics or political power we have only to imagine a mexico suddenly turned into a prosperous mighty country a superpower like the united states far from disappearing the differences would become more acute and clear cut

1346754 el llamado a la participaci n activa de los distintos sectores de la ciudadan a en rigor es esta la actitud que nos ha movilizado a requerir la informaci n ya que en democracia y a la hora de adoptar decisiones que impactan sobre los paranaenses no podemos seguir el famoso consejo de las enfermeras aqu el silencio no es salud ni es salud para la democracia la mayor a silenciosa

1346761 i think what redeems our industry is quality and i think we take a step back every time we take a license and exploit it with a crappy game
1346762 i dont actually believe ea is in the business of exploiting other peoples licenses with bad quality games

1346764 basically the psp version was cancelled because of control issues
1346765 since the inception of the top 8 in 1972 we have seen the birth of many legends and some truly memorable matches this year with the exciting innovations introduced by psl and the new sponsor mtn i feel that the competition will be fiercer than ever before and i am certain there are no favourites
1346766 as the only african global sponsor of the 2010 fifa world cup south africa mtn has shown its passion for football through the mtn 8 competition we are taking that passion and giving south african football fans the opportunity to see the best clubs in the country competing for the lucrative r8 million winner takes all prize wafa wafa which loosely translated means last man standing
1346767 just like the teams we encourage the fans to go all out and demonstrate their passion for the game and their club to determine who the ultimate football supporter of the mtn 8 wafa wafa competition will be the most passionate fans at each match will be selected to take part in a half time competition with the crowd voting for the winner the eight winners from each of the matches will then go through to the final where they will compete for the ultimate prize and to be crowned the ultimate mtn 8 wafa wafa fan

1346782 i dont think taiye can still make it here again we have not seen him and nothing has been heard from him
1346783 the coach and we the pla 0yers have been waiting an xiously to hear from him but it appears his club does not want to release him
1346784 as far as coach siasia is concerned taye taiwo is no longer part of his plan for this olympics because the player himself as not demonstrated commitment to the team in spite of persistent effort to reach him
1346785 only god knows what happened along the line because coach siasia has always seen taiwo as one of the stalwarts especially on the thorny part of qualification to the games but things have changed suddenly when he stopped communicating with us and several calls to all his known numbers will never go through
1346786 even attempts late sunday proved abortive because contacts with his brothers in lagos and wife in europe did not yield any dividend they will always tell us they will relay the message to him
1346787 as things stand now the coach has made up his mind to drop him and look towards the alternatives in that position
1346788 if tomorrow the young messi runs into problem with the club the whole of argentine populace will rise in his defence due to his commitment to the cause of argentina

1346792 if youre constantly exposed in your job you would certainly have concerns
1346793 because thats the way you get spray drift and inadvertent exposure

1346797 although how long that will take is still unclear but a deal is not far off not at all
1346798 that shows progress the extension is aimed at overcoming all the issues on the agenda the omen is very good
1346799 if a breakthrough is near it might not necessarily be because more people are now involved if anything i think the more the people the more difficult it might be to reach an agreement
1346800 who is deceiving who i dont know the sports minister before but i would have wished that those behind the protest go for real sports development so that our sports can be at the level it should be rather than going for protest
1346801 it has never happened before that our athletes left lagos for abuja to protest where did they converge to take the decision on how to protest definitely somebody or some people must be behind it and they must be brought to book
1346802 im going to put this expletive deleted anchor through your boat
1346803 no we were never among the favourites every one was tipping brazil and argentina but in football it is one thing to be the favourite and another to actually end up justifying that tag
1346804 we spent some time in spain malaga before leaving early for the states in fact we were there three weeks before the games started training
1346805 however in spite of our long time together we were still not given much of a chance but we believed that we could spring a surprise at the games maybe not win but at least finish amongst the medalists
1346806 yes we did struggle in our first match but at the end of the day we still managed to get the crucial victory had we lost perhaps we would have ended up celebrating at the end of the competition because defeat would have demoralised us
1346807 but as it turned out we won and it boosted our moral for the task ahead
1346808 going into this match nobody gave us much of a chance especially as they brazil had hammered ghana 4 2 in another quarter final however for us the players we saw it as gods way of giving us another chance to get it right
1346809 we did a printing of 5 000 copies initially and thats sold out

1346882 the oreilly factor the oil companies owe us just dont call it taxes
1346883 does anyone understand why obama suggesting that people keep their tires properly inflated is some sort of hilarious gaffe
1346884 mccain supporters in michigan will distribute tire gauges at obamas energy speech in lansing the rnc will also deliver gauges reading obamas energy plan to washington newsrooms
1346885 inflating your tires and getting a regular tune up sounds more like obamas plan for ego maintenance than it does for helping american families
1346886 obama refers to big oil and the need to reduce our use of oil by 35 over the next twenty years how do we get there keep inflating those tires folks
1346887 it seems to me the only thing obama wants us to do is inflate tires
1346888 barack obama stood up at a speech recently and said that one of the things that is really important from energy policy from his standpoint is to check the pressure in our tires so heres a tire gauge and you can go out in the parking lot here and check your tires now thats an interesting thing we want you to have good pressure in your tires you know it will very mildly add to your fuel efficiency but checking the air pressure in your tires is not an energy policy for the united states of america
1346889 gop wont let go of its new tire gauge toy
1346890 americans take this tire gauge and check the pressure in your tires to ensure youre doing even the smallest measures to conserve fuel republicans take this tire gauge and shove it up your ass
1346891 energy efficiency by using improved technology and practicing sensible habits in our homes businesses and automobiles is a big part of the answer and is something we can achieve right now

1346898 but hey who ever let the facts or supporters positions get in the way of a political attack aboard the low road express thats no problem at all
1346899 a person is smart people are dumb panicky dangerous animals and you know it
1346900 hey look at us we are a bunch of childish fucking idiots
1346901 what is the cost of an intermediate range ballistic missle
1346902 if this moves us one millimetre closer to a public enquiry it will have been worthwhile i passionately believe that with all my heart
1346903 it is not about whether we are right nor about whether these deaths were suicides
1346904 the struggle that the parents of these people have been through after their childrens deaths in many ways is as bad as the fact of having lost their children the play genuinely mirrors my shock at discovering that we do not live in a fair and just society
1346905 it would be egotistical to imagine that a play could force a public enquiry but it if does i would be satisfied it is what these people deserve and what we all deserve as citizens
1346906 ok daca mie imi merge naspa la un moment dat shit happens cat ma pot baza pe omul asta

1346908 why his jumps and dives with feet curled and body perfectly poised appealed he kept goal on his toes like a coiled spring always ready to pounce
1346909 my confidence in goal the way i seemed to be able to catch a ball easily and my technique for taming shots i put down to barba luka
1346910 it was a simple drill we did in practice he made me catch a small ball about the size of a baseball and after that it was very easy for me to catch a football
1346911 we scored an own goal after eight minutes and then had 10 great chances but ended up losing 2 0
1346912 if the game against the ussr was our most dramatic this was our unluckiest
1346913 at the time the president of the fa was rato dugonjic a senior politician who headed the department of youth
1346914 we were promised that if we got through the group wed each get a vespa which at the time cost 100 in italy but then on the day of the germany game dugonjic came and said there were no scooters and that it wasnt good for us to play like the bourgeoisie when other people had to work just to buy food suddenly we were public enemy no1 and we hadnt even asked for anything so after that we were depressed
1346915 somehow it always seemed easier when i could look at a player eye to eye
1346916 my time was the time of romantic football there were still lots of good moves dribbles and attractive goals tactics still hadnt eaten football it was the playing style of the 1962 world cup and then in england in 1966 that started the new era of football when the ball was no longer the most important thing in the game
1346917 still has to be a lot like he was in my time he has to have courage and self confidence
1346918 i thought a four rib standing roast looks good on the table everyone likes beef
1346919 not beef how about a nothing says feasting like a plump pair of deeply bronzed sheep buttocks
1346920 you dont think its bit of a palaver you know faffy
1346921 look i really wanted an impressive piece of meat its going to go well with the and i want to do the home smoked eel starter
1346922 pommes anna is ridiculously rich just an excuse for melted butter
1346923 and surely youre not doing a starter are you i mean its so fussy god youll be doing amuses next
1346924 sexual escapades among cast members drug use and hardcore partying
1346925 to be blunt i was in no fit state to broadcast
1346926 if id gone on air then terrified viewers around the uk would have been rushing towards their remote controls i was a mess
1346927 explained to our bosses back home that technical difficulties were making the broadcast impossible
1346928 maybe i just dont have the right deodorant but i think the problem is far more fundamental than that
1346929 various solutions have been suggested one of my colleagues has offered me some potion that he was given by the army in afghanistan apparently once you cover your face with it you get about a quarter of an hour sweat free that bit sounds fine but the next bit rather dimmed my enthusiasm im told that once your 15 minutes is up your face explodes with everything that has been covered up before and that your skin can feel numb for hours

1346932 the crop protection association fully supports farmers weeklys sos campaign to make europes policymakers see sense on pesticide approvals the entire food chain must unite to oppose these measures demand an eu wide assessment of their impact and stop this process in its tracks
1346933 the british crop production council believes the farmers weekly initiative is excellent because it highlights the threat that the eu proposals impose on food quality across europe the eu commission has made no impact assessment thus meps have no facts to guide their decisions
1346934 the association of independent crop consultants is committed to the farmers weekly campaign to preserve food production and quality and to fight eu proposals that would reduce approved pesticides by up to 85
1346935 the current parliamentary proposals if not modified will have huge effects we fully support this campaign to get them modified into a more acceptable form
1346936 the arable group is an independent organisation and is concerned that the eu is contemplating changing to a pesticide registration system based on undefined hazard based criteria without a transparent impact assessment on human and environmental health and food production
1346937 the european crop protection association applauds the save our sprays campaign all interested parties should join efforts to watch over the future of our european agriculture we need legislative decisions that reflect reality and are based on sound science and realistic conditions of use

1346946 the pr m treaty is the start of a powerful european police force
1346947 the father didnt know anything about it and came back to find his son sitting in the back of a police van there was a lack of understanding and a lot of emotion according to the french rules the father wasnt allowed to talk to his son i thought this was too hard on them and i managed to convince my colleagues too normally a lad like that would have spent a night in the cells because there was someone present who knew both languages and cultures he was back by the evening
1346948 the french had cold feet about it at first they thought i would be looking over their shoulder when it became clear that temporarily i would be one of them i was quickly accepted
1346949 both formal french manners and the four stripes on officer van der hoevens shoulder clearly play a role here his rank commands respect in law abiding france
1346950 its not something im used to in the netherlands for my german colleague who wears an impressive star at first people jumped to attention and saluted
1346951 they bother the tourists and steal the trade from the official vendors theyve paid good money for a pitch
1346952 criminals increasingly operate across borders we have to move with that development to keep on top of them i notice it for example when we intercept consignments of drugs sometimes during an investigation or a chase i literally and metaphorically come up against borders
1346953 i believe in a police apparatus that operates smoothly at european level in versailles and paris on a small scale were trying out how this works in practice this is the future the french interior minister had a nice way of putting it she called us the children of pr m
1346954 its the north korean state circus and koreans are great acrobats its first contact for many people here in europe and its contact in an area where north koreans excel pyongyang is trying to create a positive image of north korea
1346955 what happened then is that china and the us had decided to seek a rapprochement and table tennis was the route they chose to facilitate that it was also a way to let the world see that the two nations were slowly becoming friends but beyond that it didnt have any other function
1346956 no for north korea the relationship with the united states is of prime importance the netherlands is of limited importance to pyongyang politically this visit by the state circus doesnt carry that much weight except of course to announce that north korea is slowly trying to make contact with the rest of the world its chief function is to create a positive image of north korea

1346997 some of the practices of certain dioceses in the american church continue to put our relations as a communion under strain and some problems wont be resolved while those practices continue
1346998 if the choice is that the only way i can persuade them to stay in relationship with us is to change what i believe i cant do that with integrity i think all of us believe that being faithful to god is even of greater importance that being faithful to each other

1347007 we might not have reached consensus in fact we certainly havent reached consensus but i believe people are feeling that significant growth is occurring
1347008 head to head debates that create winners or losers do not necessarily resolve difficult issues in the life of the church as compared to face to face encounters
1347009 its more important to be faithful to the gospel than faithful to each other
1347010 we dont see why welcoming the gay or lesbian person into the church must mean blessing what they do in the churchs name for example blessing same sex relationships or accepting them for ordination for example as bishops whatever their lifestyle
1347011 acknowledging the spiritual gifts of gay and lesbian believers they will certainly be likely to feel that the restraint you ask for is a betrayal please try to see why this is such a dilemma for many of us
1347012 we seem often to be threatening death to each other not offering life
1347013 what some see as confused or reckless innovation in some provinces the ordination of gene robinson in america for example is felt as a body blow to integrity of mission and as a matter of physical risk to christians to anglicans living tensely with muslim neighbours in northern nigeria for instance
1347014 but nor are we like the international lutheran federation were somewhere in the middle
1347015 unless we do have something about which we consent which we trust to resolve some of our differences we shall be flying further apart
1347016 there have to be protocols and conventions by which we recognise each other as churches and by which we understand and manage exchanges between us
1347017 thrust for evangelisation animates both the anglican communion and the roman catholic church
1347018 much is spoken today of diseases like alzheimers and parkinsons
1347019 by analogy their symptoms can at times be found even in our own christian communities for example when we live myopically in the fleeting present oblivious to our past heritage and apostolic traditions we could well be suffering from spiritual alzheimers
1347020 and when we behave in a disorderly manner going whimsically on our own way without any coordination with the head or the other members of our community it could be ecclesial churchlike parkinsons
1347021 the great pity is that to have those voices would have been a healing and helpful thing
1347022 corporately the american house of bishops asked for forgiveness last year
1347023 and 50 of the provinces individual autonomous national anglican churches or a bit more said thats probably all right
1347024 the bishops represent not only their dioceses but also the worldwide fellowship and thats the rationale
1347025 what counts for me as wrong is any relationship outside a covenant of mutual love and support
1347026 i dont think that sex outside marriage is as god purposes it
1347027 in the question of same sex relationships the lambeth conference has made its views clear and that is the position i hold as archbishop

1347171 okay ill catch up with you guys in a sec
1347172 it is fantastic for us to host this game we know its only a pre season cup but for a club thats only been in existence for 12 months its still a pretty good achievement
1347173 some people can scrap it around for four days ive seen guys hang in there and find it form later in the week its sometimes not bad when youre not quite on at a major
1347174 ive had a bit of trouble trying to come to terms with everything im going home next week to catch up with the family and deal with it a bit more
1347175 ive gone from such a big high to such a big low some days not wanting to get out of bed and play golf but thats the job
1347176 if you tell a player that hes not wanted he goes to his manager who says thats great and then they try to get out of the club and the club gets nothing for them but he might be put up for trade you never know even if hes got a contract
1347177 no doubt someone would want an alan didak so the club might be playing the smart game and saying all right hes at the club hes got his suspension if we go public saying were going to sack him now we dont get anything for him at the end of it it doesnt help the cause
1347178 ive got no worries with the philosophy of the club i have been a bloke who has been pushing that things havent been hard enough but ive got no worries with it now
1347179 i said i thought they should have gone all the way and sacked didak but this still hurts them and i think it hurts them more now that they miss out on the game that they love and now they have got to work hard and win back the respect

1347195 the city councils parks service wishes to correct a recent misrepresentation of the position of the councils rainbow group for lesbian gay and bisexual employees
1347196 as part of a report to the downs committee recently officers from the parks service incorrectly gave the impression that the rainbow group had officially objected to the proposal
1347197 in fact the rainbow group did not give any collective response to the consultation and left group members to respond individually if they chose to do so
1347198 the parks service would like to make it clear that they accept the comments were wrongly attributed to the rainbow group and to apologise for any distress caused to group members as a result of subsequent local and national media coverage
1347199 the parks service hopes that this statement will help redress any loss of reputation that the group may have suffered both inside and outside the authority

1347254 no creo que haya ning n problema el entrenador es el que decidir la posici n de cada uno en el campo guti es un fant stico jugador y es uno de los mejores de la plantilla
1347255 ha sido dif cil porque tiene una lesi n y l estaba apenado al mismo tiempo que yo estaba contento por venir al final la lesi n no ha sido para tanto y estamos todos muy contentos
1347256 la mejor posici n en la que creo que puedo dar m s de m es detr s de la delantera aunque tambi n por la izquierda o por la derecha hay varias opciones

1347258 meinte weise nach der partie im vordergrund stand f r uns hier die platzgew hnung im stadion 2 das wirklich sehr sch n geworden ist allerdings ist der platz sehr rutschig das hat sich hier schon herauskristallisiert dadurch spielt der zufall schon ein wenig mit aber das gilt dann ja f r alle teams
1347259 ich gehe davon aus dass sie am donnerstag nach dem spiel gegen brasilien wieder mittrainieren kann

1347266 die kommt genau zum richtigen zeitpunkt wir m ssen nach sechs harten monaten unsere batterien aufladen damit wir f r das n chste rennen und f r das saisonfinale bereit sind ich werde in finnland ein bisschen relaxen auch wenn die wettervorhersage nicht gut ist
1347267 wann immer du den abstand zum gesamtf hrenden verringern kannst ist das gut
1347268 ist gar nicht so schlecht nat rlich kann es immer noch besser stehen das wollen wir auch erreichen aber ungarn war ein entt uschendes wochenende f r mich das einzig positive ist das resultat wann immer du den abstand zum gesamtf hrenden verringern kannst ist das gut ich habe mehr punkte geholt als all meine direkten gegner was vor der sommerpause ganz wichtig war
1347269 die letzten rennen sind nicht so gelaufen wie ich mir das vorgestellt hatte
1347270 immer ist irgendetwas komisches passiert und wir fanden nicht das beste setup f r das auto wir haben versucht einen guten kompromiss zu finden aber das brachte alles nichts f r das n chste rennen in valencia m ssen wir das problem l sen
1347271 du kannst aber nicht weltmeister werden wenn du immer vom sechsten startplatz losfahren musst
1347272 war das qualifying wieder der entscheidende moment im negativen sinne im zweiten versuch des dritten qualifyings konnte ich das auto nicht auf der strecke halten mein fehler du kannst aber nicht weltmeister werden wenn du immer vom sechsten startplatz losfahren musst selbst wenn du eine sekunde schneller bist als der fahrer vor dir kannst du ihn nicht berholen und die pace nicht nutzen
1347273 im hungaroring steckte ich hinter alonso fest der im letzten sektor ein wirklich gutes auto hatte das war die einzige stelle wo ich ihn h tte berholen k nnen daran sieht man wieder einmal dass man in budapest nicht berholen kann nach dem letzten boxenstopp hatte ich freie fahrt und ich konnte pushen das auto lief gut und ich konnte um acht zehntel pro runde zulegen leider konnte ich glock wegen eines mechanischen problems am ende nicht mehr attackieren
1347274 ist ein gro artiges rennen gefahren und hat unser potenzial bewiesen leider f r ihn und das team musste er am ende stehen bleiben das ist das h ssliche gesicht des motorsports aber ich habe das fr her auch schon ein paar mal erlebt

1347277 the wind picked up and in probably five seconds it blew my friend into her husband

1347280 religion is more important to them than their own life or peace for their mothers and so they set out to perform jihad
1347281 starting from last year east turkestan organizations have been persistently trying to launch activities targeting the olympic games
1347282 they want to use the simplest methods to turn 2008 into a year of mourning
1347283 we are scared that after this things may be even harder for uyghurs
1347284 we urge international society to put pressure on china to freely let journalists report from kashgar and deal with the issue legally and not go after innocent uyghurs
1347285 but we do know the crackdown in xinjiang especially ahead of the olympics has increased discontent among uyghurs
1347286 the commodities are still getting pounded you have oil drop down around 120 u s and now its just kind of sitting around there
1347287 materials and energy stocks got killed yesterday in europe and in the u s so its a little catching up on that score
1347288 and weve got continued weakness in oil prices and most commodity prices today
1347289 wall street is up 1 per cent were down 2 1 2 per cent
1347290 since july 15 weve seen a drastic turnaround in sector rotation at the expense of oil stocks
1347291 the big thing will be the u s rate decision
1347292 the thing about getting a much bigger house is the cost per square foot goes down because not many people want to take on a house that size
1347293 we took out part of the ceiling space and put in soundproofing to take out some of the noise
1347294 its no worse than living in a townhouse or duplex you hear footsteps and sometimes voices but because the building is solidly built its fine
1347295 its people wanting to adapt to a marketplace that has strained their resources so you get creative out of the box ideas floating around about how to enter in
1347296 on my single salary theres no way i could carry a mortgage
1347297 the four of us have decided that when it comes time well give serious consideration to using geothermal heating that type of thing
1347298 we often see parents and children and friends who buy together
1347299 in doing so these people are able to build home equity faster by combining resources and sharing in the profits of higher priced real estate
1347300 for the price of a condo we each got a good sized space and we own the building and we own the land
1347301 the price per square foot for a house when we bought was around 200 says ms
1347302 and the price per square foot for a new condo was getting up to 400
1347303 you cant have your car in the driveway and all the things that guys want
1347304 there was also at the time the pressure of getting into the market and getting a piece of land
1347305 i grew up here and i have lots of friends 35 to 45 who will probably never own a place
1347306 they never had jobs to allow them to buy places when they were under 30 and now the market is out of their reach
1347307 it sounds stupid but its almost like the whole friends experience on tv where they are living in separate apartments but they are always walking in on each other all the time
1347308 i would hate for them to make this a habit and take it into the community
1347309 they could get themselves into some serious situations that could impact their futures
1347310 theft is always a consideration when you are working with adolescents cash high value food and some employees earning near the minimum wage

1347319 the customer has the right to expect that what is advertised as kosher is kosher
1347320 the entanglements involved here between religion and the state are not only excessive in themselves but they have the unconstitutional effect of endorsing and advancing religion

1347326 our investment in expanding our worldwide footprint with people and facilities is paying off
1347327 they want to make sure their children and grandchildren know there are certain values they want to pass along with their legacy such as education and hard work
1347328 and a c at harvard isnt the same as a c at a community college
1347329 the purpose is to allow the children to all live in the same neighborhood
1347330 the kids who work for charities can live on the same streets as their doctor and lawyer siblings
1347331 if youre home raising a family were not going to deny you the trust payments
1347332 you want beneficiaries to have a voice but not a controlling voice because they will inevitably want to increase the amount of money paid out of the trust to them
1347333 leave enough flexibility so youre not ruling from the grave
1347334 err on the side of giving the money to them anyway
1347335 i tell them to think about what values they want their kids and grandkids to have typically work ethic and responsible management of money
1347336 just because youre having fun while youre volunteering doesnt disqualify the deduction
1347337 write down how much time you spent working on the project what you did and even who you met
1347338 we always recommend that our volunteers follow up with their own personal tax adviser
1347339 after taking the tax savings into account we spent less than we would have on our typical vacation budget
1347340 of course any move to change the present system loss caps will require amendments to certain rules rest assured that everyone affected by such a move will be afforded due process and given the opportunity to participate in the public consultations that will be conducted on such amendments

1347343 the local foreign affairs department made an apology tuesday to two japanese reporters
1347344 we strongly protest against the violent detention of a reporter who was reporting by fair means
1347345 i dont speak chinese so i couldnt understand what they were doing or saying they just made me sit there i could not make a phone call it was unbelievable
1347346 we heard that the chinese side pointed out that it is forbidden to film military facilities and it seems like there was confusion because the scene of the assault was just 50 meters from a military facility
1347347 the fccc condemns the recent beating by paramilitary police of two japanese journalists in kashgar
1347348 this would be utterly unacceptable at any time it is particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics when china had promised complete media openness
1347349 disabled a switch of his taxi to automatically kill the power of the engine after several minutes
1347350 may wire lang na sisipain namin para hindi halata na nakakabit sa karburador para mamatay pagkatapos ng ilang minuto there is a wire linked to the carburetor that we only need to kick loose to shut off the engine after a few minutes said taxi driver rico paloma

1347354 currently there is no impact to production and no personnel have been evacuated
1347355 the philippines is a participatory democracy this moa is very very important all stakeholders should have been consulted i understand five provinces are against this
1347356 the supreme courts temporary restraining order was very correct in doing so
1347357 a lot of people particularly those in mindanao dont know about the moa the government should reveal this to prevent conflict
1347358 in our meeting in the bishops ulama conference we have been saying that let them milf manage properly the armm develop the armm and then later on it might be okay with the people who knows but now there are no good effects in armm and it might get worse
1347359 we are going to talk about this we should be really involved since we do not know what the contents of the moa are
1347360 this is a good sign that the people are aware that they are concerned about what is happening to the country
1347361 is part of my vision for connecting with the community
1347362 we could also look at what other services they have been wanting to provide and how we could support those programs
1347363 those are just a few of the things that we hope to discuss that evening i am excited about the opportunity and i hope that we have a great turnout
1347364 its the best feeling in the world knowing you can go 100 mph and not slow down and know youre opponent will slow down
1347365 it gives you amazing confidence and belief in yourself for me its one of my best assets
1347366 a lot of people who talk a tough game say theyll do this and that but at end of the day when their back is against the wall and theyre taking a beating theyll quit roger never quits and thats what i consider a fighter when you come back from adversity thats what i consider a fighter and hes a fighter
1347367 with roger im motivated because of the cardio he brings in
1347368 ive had a great training camp its awesome im in the best shape of my life its fun to be with an opponent who pushes the pace
1347369 i used to try to have a plan for certain things
1347370 but then when you try to execute a certain strategy forcing certain things gets tough you end up fighting with blinders on now i wait for those opportunities instead of forcing them you got to have a strategy but forcing it wont happen
1347371 last year i fought five times so i didnt have the time and opportunity to travel and learn from these guys and everybody else
1347372 i was able to do that now with some time off i had the chance to train with better guys and competitors it was a great experience
1347373 this is where it began for me its where i had my first amateur fight and where i became a pro lot of people saw me compete here saw me grow into the fighter i am today and now they get the chance to watch me live
1347374 any time any fighter steps in the octagon youre either going to move up the ladder or get bumped down so im giving my heart and soul to it im looking forward to the challenge
1347375 the u s defeats russia in hockey film at 11
1347376 because of the time difference a lot of morning events in china will be televised live in prime time here
1347377 i think those who want to be kept in the dark on the rest will have to work very hard to avoid knowing whats happened because information is so much more pervasive news is everywhere and were not even aware were getting it some of the time
1347378 its on the home page of your computer in your e mail on your mobile phone in elevators on top of taxi cabs on billboards and the sides of buildings you think youre watching a show that has no connection to the olympics and information will scroll across the bottom of the screen we pick up a lot of information through osmosis and i think the only time youre truly aware of just how much is when youre trying to avoid it
1347379 its live on the east coast and in the central time zone which is roughly 81 to 82 percent of all the households in the united states
1347380 historically we have always shown the olympics on tape on the west coast and the majority of viewers have repeatedly told us that the vast majority of them well in excess of 80 percent want to see the olympics when theyre available to see the olympics
1347381 they dont want to see the key events of the day happening at 4 or 5 oclock their time they want to get home and watch them
1347382 the magic of tivo helps me avoid knowing a result in advance
1347383 i can take my wife out to dinner the night of a usc football game on the road avoiding turning on the radio or sitting in a bar equipped with a tv set then watch when i get home past midnight if necessary
1347384 there are two problems with spoilers in terms of advertisers one you may time shift a little and fast forward past their ads in a way you wouldnt if you have to watch live to get the result and two if you learn the result early and it isnt that interesting you may skip the telecast altogether

1347391 for a company that has really been a high flyer they were no 1 for them to drop is problematic
1347392 but were not finished we are going to put much more rigor around our service delivery record and aim to improve so we can meet our customer expectations in this critical part of the business
1347393 when a company grows sometimes they dont pay as much attention to all aspects of the process as they should
1347394 in dells case they didnt focus on services as much as they should have
1347395 that led them to trouble in last year or two though they have tried to devote a lot more attention and resources to customer service
1347396 the one thats the most critical of all is rarely discussed
1347397 the fit between the customers specific needs and wants and what the company is offering
1347398 if you have a good fit between buyer and seller you have a high level of satisfaction
1347399 a lot of their problems stemmed from as they expanded rapidly and they tended to outsource their operations they set up these call centers around the world i dont think the service they were getting out of them was as good as it was before they did all this expansion
1347400 they just made sure customers didnt have to go to dealerships for service and made cars very reliable
1347401 there would probably be a market for a more costly product if it could be demonstrated that it was more reliable and did not break
1347402 give this guy what he wants he knows more about computers than anyone in dell tech support including you
1347403 they have always had more time and money to lobby lawmakers while mothers tend to devote their time to raising the children she said

1347457 senator obamas stance on offshore oil drilling has been mischaracterized he has not changed his position he has continually campaigned against additional drilling calling the policy a gimmick saying it was a scheme and ridiculing those who support it with his steadfast opposition to john mccains all of the above approach to our energy crisis americans should know that barack obama remains opposed to additional domestic oil drilling speaker pelosi moveon org and the sierra club can take comfort from the fact that barack obama still opposes additional domestic oil drilling meanwhile the american people can be sure that john mccain will do what is necessary to reduce this countrys dependence on middle east oil and bring down prices at the pump
1347458 this wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
1347459 if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it this is not real i know its tempting the polls say the majority of americans think its one way well resolve our problems but its not real

1347478 shortly after the meeting began the captain heard a woman yell from the curtain and when he turned saw siddiqui holding the warrant officers rifle and pointing it directly at the captain
1347479 the interpreter seated closest to siddiqui lunged at her and pushed the rifle away as siddiqui pulled the trigger siddiqui fired at least two shots but no one was hit the warrant officer returned fire with a 9 mm service pistol and fired approximately two rounds at siddiquis torso hitting her at least once

1347524 republicans have been escalating their attacks on democratic presidential candidate sen barack obama ill and the democrats over oil drilling and we need to push back hard
1347525 speaker pelosi blocked their plan because it wont help lower gas prices but it will line the pockets of big oil executives the same people donating millions of dollars to republicans
1347526 but republicans are working hard to make it seem like theyre fighting for cash strapped commuters and not the oil companies who wrote their plan
1347527 weve invited the media and having a good crowd is critical to show them that voters dont want oil industry gimmicks they want real solutions like alternative energy to solve our energy crisis

1347573 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1347574 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded center contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1347575 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from m87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1347576 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of m87
1347577 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1347578 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1347579 in m87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1347580 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1347581 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1347582 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters center m87 sits at the center of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the center probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1347583 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time
1347584 i stated how the uns reporting that animal agriculture contributes more to greenhouse gas emissions than all of transportation i mentioned that over 10 billion land animals are funneled through egregious conditions in factory farms and that it requires an obscene amount of water and resources to maintain them 70 of all our grain goes through them i reiterated that our health epidemic is only compounded by our environmental crises and resource depletion and what as the leader of the most amazing nation would he do about this his response included an admission that our infrastructure needs fixing and that subsidies need to be taken away from large scale animal ag helping small family farms he acknowledged that our health care crises needs to incorporate preventative measures including more fresh vegetables and fruit he also said schools need more of these items versus pre packaged food and meat products and of course he pointed the finger at china and india and that their new diet which is mimicking ours needs to be changed

1347592 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
1347593 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
1347594 we should ask those who make profits out of reveling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
1347595 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
1347596 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women
1347597 the risks of a sharp downturn should dissuade the mpc from raising rates although we doubt that a cut will be forthcoming until next year

1347637 the idea of the caucus is to look at the refugee problem from a humanitarian perspective not to focus on why there are refugees but to look at solutions
1347638 the caucus is an attempt to conduct a dialogue with unrwa the un agency for palestinian refugees and not an attempt to force a solution
1347639 unrwa is performing a humanitarian task that we support even if there are some differences of opinion
1347640 the unhcrs mandate does not extend to the majority of palestinian refugees by virtue of paragraph 7 c of the organizations statute which excludes persons who continue to receive from other organs or agencies of the united nations protection or assistance
1347641 because refugees have to be physically present in unrwas area of operations to benefit from its assistance stateless palestinian refugees living beyond that area get no assistance from the agency unrwa

1347675 under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy thats the choice we face in this election we can choose four years more of the same failed policies that have gotten us where we are four years more of oil companies calling the shots while hard working families are struggling thats what senator mccain is offering
1347676 big oil in the white house weve seen this show before
1347677 sleeping with the enemy and dealing with the terrorists is a proven british historical habit
1347678 remember 1939 1914 not ringing any bells what about 1941 or 1917 mike liverpool
1347679 perhaps the truth is that the poms did not want their troops killed by that well known american weapon friendly fire wayne melbourne australia
1347680 if you want to make peace you dont talk to your friends you talk to your enemies
1347681 you will never be trusted to watch our backs we cannot afford it
1347682 dont humiliate the troops or fail to back up an ally
1347683 if we were fighting for oil we would have done a better job of it
1347684 and if you let me out i wont come back to court
1347685 if you dont want to get out a preliminary hearing takes longer
1347686 your honor i changed my mind i want the hearing
1347687 well you seemed to want to stay in jail i guess you cant get drugs here so it seemed like you needed to know how to stay longer
1347688 big oil is filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions
1347689 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1347690 but what do you dress as everyone dresses like this adults and everyone
1347691 as public defender you dont hate cops do you i think i found a costume you have to wait to see what it is
1347692 you give me a hundred dollars i am corrupt cop pay me and you can do whatever
1347693 you dont need to be talking to him hes been charged with embalming without a license
1347694 moment of truth stage cut the losses with bushco or sink with them
1347695 we can afford to cut off relations with any of our partners if thats what they want were not interested in what john mccain has to say let him become president first then well listen to him
1347696 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1347697 your previous posts were real rubbish but this is good this one is brilliant your blog is getting really better
1347698 i doubt well get rooney fit for the start of the season with this virus he has had its a bad virus he has not been training
1347699 the matter is closed now he is a manchester united player it is finished he is going to be a player here next season believe me
1347700 i didnt really have a proper rest but i feel ill be ready for the new season
1347701 i played five internationals for my country and then i was running up and down trying to get my brother released i didnt put on much weight
1347702 im back training now i got 10 minutes on wednesday against chicago fire which was good and another 45 minutes on sunday
1347703 after the psv game on saturday i should be very close to my fitness level but im not too worried as theres still 10 days to go and i am sure i can be ready
1347704 he came here last season and has done very well so hopefully he can score the goals again this time
1347705 but we have to create the chances for him he doesnt miss that many so with yak you know that if he gets his chance hell score one out of every two
1347706 when he first came here he struggled a little bit because the everton team work really hard and its a big part of our game i told him that from the beginning
1347707 hes improved a lot since then and is adapting to everything which is showing in his game
1347708 im delighted that the whole game is working together on this issue there is a general agreement that something has to be done to improve levels of respect for the games long term health
1347709 football engages motivates and inspires but at times we know it can spill over and get ugly we all have a responsibility to deal with these excesses and i sense there is a commitment from all quarters of the game including the media to deal with it
1347710 the managers should have dealt with the issue as soon as it arose and found a workable solution
1347711 people are going to come to this were going to make an event on the internet the way they used to the way nobody expects us to
1347712 i believe people want people to see this and i want to show it to them

1347714 what is to become of miserable consciences in quest of some solid assurance of eternal life if all the promises with regard to it have no better support than mans judgement
1347715 scripture bears upon the face of it as clear evidence of its truth as white and black do of their colour sweet and bitter of their taste
1347716 the highest proof of scripture is uniformly taken from the character of him whose word it is
1347717 our conviction of the truth of scripture must be derived from a higher source than human conjectures judgements or reasons namely the secret testimony of the spirit
1347718 the only true faith is that which the spirit of god seals on our hearts
1347719 what kind of spirit did our saviour promise to send one who should not speak of himself john 16 13 but suggest and instil the truths which he himself had delivered through the word
1347720 any spirit which passes by the wisdom of gods word and suggest any other doctrine is deservedly suspected of vanity and falsehood since satan transforms himself into an angel of light what authority can the spirit have with us if he be not ascertained by an infallible mark and assuredly he is pointed out to us by the lord with sufficient clearness but these miserable men err as if bent on their own destruction while they seek the spirit from themselves rather than from him
1347721 by the image he has stamped on the scriptures the author of the scriptures cannot vary and change his likeness such as he there appeared at first such he will perpetually remain
1347722 we embrace the spirit with no danger of delusion when we recognise him in his image that is in his word
1347723 though experience testifies that a seed of religion is divinely sown in all scarcely one in a hundred is found who cherishes it in his heart some lose themselves in superstitious observances and others of set purpose wickedly revolt from god
1347724 the fool says in his heart there is no god
1347725 although they dont disown his essence they rob him of his justice and providence and represent him as sitting idly in heaven
1347726 after they have closed their own eyes god makes their hearts dull amp heavy and hence seeing they see not
1347727 no religion is genuine that is not in accordance with truth
1347728 in short while their confidence ought to have been fixed upon him they put him aside and rest in themselves
1347729 they bewilder themselves in such a maze of error that the darkness of ignorance obscures and ultimately extinguishes those sparks which were designed to show them the glory of god
1347730 it is not surpassed by the eloquence of heathen writers
1347731 read demosthenes or cicero read plato aristotle or any other of that class you will i admit feel wonderfully allured pleased moved enchanted but turn from them to the reading of the sacred volume and whether you will or not it will so affect you so pierce your heart so work its way into your very marrow that in comparison of the impression so produced that of orators and philosophers will almost disappear making it manifest that in the sacred volume there is a truth divine a something which makes it immeasurably superior to all the gifts and graces attainable by man
1347732 let all those acute censors whose highest pleasure it is to banish a reverential regard of scripture from their own and other mens hearts come forward let them read the gospel of john and willing or unwilling they will find a thousand sentences which will at least arouse them from their sloth nay which will burn into their consciences as with a hot iron and check their derision
1347733 notwithstanding of the many extraordinary attempts which satan and the whole world have made to oppress and overthrow it or completely efface it from the memory of men it has flourished like the palm tree and continued invincible
1347734 sealed with the blood of so many witnesses especially when it is considered that in bearing testimony to the faith they met death not with fanatical enthusiasm as erring spirits are sometimes wont to do but with a firm and constant yet sober godly zeal
1347735 to daily place himself in our view that we cannot open our eyes without being compelled to behold him
1347736 his essence indeed is incomprehensible utterly transcending all human thought but on each of his works his glory is engraven in characters so bright distinct and illustrious that none however dull amp illiterate can plead ignorance as their excuse
1347737 what excuse can there be for the sloth of any man who will not take the trouble of descending into himself that he may find him
1347738 makes his excellence in this respect a pretext for denying that there is a god
1347739 neither his power nor his wisdom is shrouded in darkness
1347740 we cannot plead ignorance without being at the same time convicted by our consciences both of sloth and ingratitude
1347741 by the erroneous estimate we form we either so obscure or pervert his daily works as at once to rob them of their glory and the author of his praise
1347742 there was no pure and authentic religion founded merely on common belief
1347743 i believe in christianity in the same way as i believe the sun has risen not just because i see it but because by it i see everything else
1347744 all will be well and all manner of things will be well
1347745 it never occurred to me to blame god for the holocaust god was not the cause of this event wicked sinful human beings were the cause of this event
1347746 for seeing how the minds of men were carried to and fro and found no resting place he chose the jews for a peculiar people and then hedged them in that they might not like others go astray
1347747 for the instruction of the church he employs not dumb teachers merely but opens his sacred mouth
1347748 its truth might subsist in the world during all ages
1347749 if we turn aside from it we shall never reach the goal because we are off the course
1347750 it is better to limp in the way than run with the greatest swiftness out of it
1347751 our goal is to just collect taxes it is only as a last resort that we would pursue foreclosure
1347752 when the religious speaker in explaining that a man can do nothing of himself sets something wholly particular in relation to this principle he gives the auditor occasion to secure a profound insight into his own inmost heart helps him to penetrate the delusions and illusions so as to lay aside at least for a moment the bourgeois small town sugar coating in which he otherwise goes wrapped essentially the religious orator operates by referring finally to the absolute relationship that a man can do nothing of himself but he makes the transition by means of particulars which he brings into connection with it

1347760 dont talk about mary as the mother of god because while jesus is truly god a mere human couldnt give birth to god so she only gave birth to his humanity
1347761 the humanity of jesus was swallowed up in the divinity like a drop in the ocean

1347770 theres no sign of motor incoordination or other odd behaviors they just move as efficiently as they would on any other tree
1347771 ubuntu is fast becoming the new star of linux as demonstrated by the findings of alfrescos most recent open source barometer
1347772 accounting for nearly a quarter of all linux os rollouts as of january 2008 ubuntu was also the fastest growing linux distribution over the second half of 2007 with the backing of a professional organization such as canonical were delighted to be driving the growing trend towards easy to install and easy to manage open source products
1347773 were excited to work with alfresco on delivering an enterprise class content management system for ubuntu users for which this is the first step
1347774 users have a great opportunity to assess alfresco on ubuntu and see the benefits these two great open source solutions can bring organizations we will jointly deliver a pre packaged enterprise version of alfresco later in the year

1347798 wir m ssen schon im ersten spiel zu 1000 prozent da sein wenn wir einen guten turnierstart hinlegen wollen und das wollen wir wir wollen drei punkte
1347799 wir h tten gerne gegen einen etwas leichteren gegner begonnen aber wir k nnen es nicht ndern
1347800 das ist etwas ganz besonderes denn die bisherigen turniere habe ich aus verschiedenen gr nden immer verpasst ich freue mich auf meine ersten olympischen spiele
1347801 either gold is going to fall hard and fast to catch up with the oversold readings in these ratios but gold stocks wont fall as much as the metal for instance we could see gold fall down to 850 while gold stocks actually hold up that would give us a powerful signal to go long gold stocks in 2005 for instance forget about it falling below the lower band for a second gold stocks lagged the metal badly for week after week then all of a sudden the stocks stopped dropping and the metal continued lower something like that could happen now last week i was looking for the stocks to hold support for a buy point but if they fail to do that this week then ill have to look for another signal to buy
1347802 if they dont hold support here then gold stocks will likely go through their lower 200 day bollinger band and have a hard and fast sell off like they did in august of 2007 and may of 2005 that would lead to an extreme oversold condition in the stocks only seen twice in the last six years both of those times led to incredible buying opportunities and if it happened again it would be another one

1347806 there are some elements of truth in what people are saying about the inconsistencies of the president much enthusiasm was expressed by president koroma to declare his assets to the people this would have given him a clean sheet as indeed a new man in the corridors of power this idea disappeared into thin air mincing his words

1347809 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1347810 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1347811 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1347812 has merit in terms of just a short term effect on prices
1347813 i offer no suggestion it will make a long term impact on the fact that demand worldwide is going up while supply is flatlined
1347814 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1347815 we are disappointed that we have not yet received a response from iran
1347816 we agreed in the absence of a clear positive response from iran that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1347817 the incentives package contained everything iran needed to pursue a modern civil nuclear power program which irans leaders claim is their aim the pressure on iran to comply with the demands of the international community and its u n security council obligations will only grow

1348093 i was deeply offended by the articles calling antismoking activists
1348094 in a very positive light while spreading doubt and dispute about the harm caused by smoking
1348095 i am not saying that certain advertisements influenced the content of the article and the decision to publish it but a newspaper that decides to publish such an article has the obligation to prove that there is no connection between its advertising income and the way it deals with the subject of smoking
1348096 since authors of medical journal articles must state in writing that they have no vested interests it would be a good idea for general newspapers here to do the same regarding smoking
1348097 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy

1348137 well frankly outside of a sexual relationship i dont see the point to it im not thrilled with all the handshaking either but one step at a time
1348138 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1348139 a lot of ipcc estimates are heroic first approximations and should be seen as a starting point not as received wisdom
1348140 if it were easy it wouldnt be realistic because these are not easy issues
1348141 i was just struck by the enormity of the challenge before us
1348142 the notion of large reductions from the chinese perspective seems absolutely undoable
1348143 from a scientific perspective green carbon accounting and protection of the natural forests in all nations should become part of a comprehensive approach to solving the climate change problem
1348144 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
1348145 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the carbon dioxide released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
1348146 to date in climate change discussions in the forest sector all the attention has been on reforestation and afforestation
1348147 at the bali climate change conference in december everybody kind of woke up and realised that natural forests store a vast amount of carbon and that we cant afford to allow further emissions from deforestation and forest degeneration because these are on top of fossil fuel burning
1348148 if you are contacted directly by the inspector generals office or the government accountability office requesting information of any kind please do not respond to questions or make any statements
1348149 i would suggest that a minority of people had hidden them with the intention of causing harm to police officers and possibly to the horses or dogs we are using on patrol
1348150 to link a stash of knives allegedly found somewhere in the hoo peninsula in kent to the camp for climate action is nothing but a smear campaign against us
1348151 to suggest that the campers environmentalists living at a camp serving only vegan food would even consider hurting a police horse shows the polices press release to be nothing but political policing
1348152 this in no way justifies the way the police are treating the camp
1348153 it is disgraceful to suggest that the campers have criminal intent
1348154 this is obviously an attempt by the police to distract us from raising issues about climate change
1348155 copenhagen will play a big part in showing that europes creation of a cap and trade carbon market will pay off
1348156 they provide a great business opportunity for those willing to take it

1348171 the idea of twenty20 cricket at the olympics is definitely worth pursuing
1348172 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1348173 i had the time of my life at those games winning the gold medal was one of the highlights of my career
1348174 twenty20 is going through a honeymoon phase at the moment
1348175 but in the next few years i believe it will become a worldwide phenomenon
1348176 take it from someone who has won almost everything cricket has to offer the olympics is the absolute pinnacle in sport
1348177 the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience

1348189 in general we are pleased with the performance of our parks through july
1348190 we continue to be optimistic about the fourth quarter and fiscal 2008
1348191 at this time we expect fiscal 2009 revenues to be above fiscal 2008 revenues however it appears increasingly possible that fiscal 2009 could see modest if any growth in worldwide air traffic demand for commercial oem aircraft production remains strong and we expect will continue to do so in 2009

1348202 im just an ordinary middle aged primary school teacher i went out there to have an adventure and got a lot more adventure than what i was looking for i never imagined this would happen

1348209 the original incident was something very innocent and then what should have been seen as a minor error and certainly a very innocent one suddenly became blown up into something extremely important and the whole thing has been very very worrying and quite horrendous

1348212 ive had a lot of interest from woman going on cruises where youre usually expected to dress up for evening meals
1348213 in fact ive started a book listing who is wearing what when groups of friends travel together so women can be sure theyll not turn up wearing the same dress as the other women in their group
1348214 i also keep details of dresses for girls going to formals too and ive already had mums buying their daughters dresses for formals taking place in october
1348215 i love finding out about people and about the special occasions they are going to

1348221 we got the idea in 2005 when osama had just released a new tape and suddenly he was all over the news
1348222 all the newscasters were like why havent we found this guy why havent we brought him to justice hes just taunting us again where in the world is osama bin laden
1348223 i was like thats a great question that became the jumping off point for us to ask ourselves how would we go about this where would we go who would we talk to
1348224 for every great review we got we would get two other types one camp would attack me personally and come after the film the other camp were basically saying how can you make light of this situation it was one of the most tragic events in american history
1348225 of course thats true but if you dont laugh youll cry all of the time

1348229 everyone in the new idea office stopped in their tracks when they saw these gorgeous photos a couple of us close to tears of shared joy at the sight of little shiloh cradling her new baby brother
1348230 then they all go off in a happy little tune as if nothing has happened in the original mozart obeyed the tradition at the time all the operas end in an ensemble big happy ending the aristocracy liked to have a happy ending and they went off and had big dinners afterwards they didnt like to be confronted
1348231 the trend has been to drop the finale this will come and go theres no doubt it is all beautiful music so i thought why not do something different
1348232 good morning baby kisses ensue do you mind if i have some of the covers you were sleeping on them and im freezing

1348248 there are real problems in xinjiang but my assessment is that these people are well known and have been infiltrated by the chinese security apparatus
1348249 i call on the us government and the international community to condemn chinas manipulation of terror threats to kill and intimidate uighurs on the eve of the olympic games
1348250 my biggest concern is that an incident like this and the repression that follows could further polarise the uighur and han communities in xinjiang

1348342 this is an exciting prospect which is large and has been de risked by a well drilled previously on the same structure which despite encountering hydrocarbons was not tested at the time
1348343 the new seismic survey over the prospect has already been acquired and we therefore look forward to completing the interpretation and reaching an early decision on the feasibility of drilling the prospect by the end of 2009 to become part of our ongoing drilling programme which includes several near term wells to be drilled in 2008 on east breagh west breagh marsvin south east tor and hyme

1348369 the problems have been difficult weve all heard the reactions of head teachers and weve heard the apologies from the qca and their contractor and theyve acknowledged the reputational damage
1348370 but it still remains the case that ofqual are advising us that the quality of marking is as good as its been in previous years
1348371 there are always reviews and appeals that happens every year i have confidence in these figures that we are putting out today
1348372 compared to 1997 101 000 more 11 year olds are now achieving the target level for their age in english and 93 000 more in maths
1348373 these are alarming figures suggesting that fewer pupils are achieving excellence and that pupils are not being stretched to the best of their abilities
1348374 the shambles surrounding the marking of this years tests are a disgrace 460 schools still do not have results for all of their pupils
1348375 this year as every year the results are based on a statistically robust sample any claims that not all the results are available and therefore they should not be published should be dismissed as ill informed nonsense
1348376 i have no doubt however that the serial detractors who rush every year to criticise the outcome of the tests will once again be much in evidence
1348377 instead of publishing the results the government should have taken the opportunity to ask lord sutherland to conduct a fundamental review of the entire flawed testing system
1348378 criticising the publishing of the sats results shows a lack of understanding of statistical theory with almost complete returns the results are reliable at a national level
1348379 arbonne parties are still relatively new to northern ireland but theyre proving successful because they can be tailored to suit individual tastes

1348407 did not respond with vigour to reports that a vulnerable person was missing having last been seen in the company of a man who was a known sex offender
1348408 together these aspects should have alerted them sooner to the possibility they were dealing with a potential murder inquiry
1348409 they should have conducted their investigations accordingly until this proved not to be the case
1348410 they initially treated the investigation as a missing person inquiry rather than a possible abduction murder
1348411 however the grounds to arrest this man were available within 48 hours of arlene being reported missing
1348412 his statement to the missing person inquiry included a number of inconsistencies he was on bail for serious sexual offences and had been convicted of a number of sexual crimes these factors should have raised serious concerns for the whereabouts of arlene
1348413 the police did not arrest him until 46 days after the disappearance was reported the failure to do so sooner prevented the seizure of clothing he wore on the night of the disappearance and allowed for the opportunity to dispose of evidence the early seizure and examination of significant exhibits would have had the potential to provide valuable evidence
1348414 i have been sick waiting for this and i was shaking too much to drive the car
1348415 the most important thing for me is still to find arlenes remains thats my first priority

1348458 it was granted me to carry away from my prison years on my bent back which nearly broke beneath its load this essential experience how a human being becomes evil and how good in the intoxication of youthful successes i had felt myself to be infallible and i was therefore cruel in the surfeit of power i was a murderer and an oppressor in my most evil moments i was convinced that i was doing good and i was well supplied with systematic arguments and it was only when i lay there on rotting prison straw that i sensed within myself the first stirrings of good gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states nor between classes nor between political parties either but right through every human heart and through all human hearts this line shifts inside us it oscillates with the years and even within hearts overwhelmed by evil one small bridgehead of good is retained and even in the best of all hearts there remains an uprooted small corner of evil since then i have come to understand the truth of all the religions of the world they struggle with the evil inside a human being inside every human being it is impossible to expel evil from the world in its entirety but it is possible to constrict it within each person and since that time i have come to understand the falsehood of all the revolutions in history they destroy only those carriers of evil contemporary with them and also fail out of haste to discriminate the carriers of good as well and they then take to themselves as their heritage the actual evil itself magnified still more
1348459 but we should not deceive ourselves into believing that the solution to the problem of evil is a political solution that it can be arrived at without spiritual discipline and without a change of life

1348466 es hora de que en occidente se defiendan no tanto los derechos humanos sino las obligaciones humanas
1348467 a la libertad destructiva e irresponsable se le ha otorgado un espacio ilimitado la sociedad parece tener pocas defensas contra el abismo de la decadencia humana como por ejemplo el abuso de la libertad para la violencia moral en contra de los j venes pel culas llenas de pornograf a cr menes y horror
1348468 se le considera parte de la libertad y te ricamente un contrapeso de los derechos de los j venes no mirar o no aceptar de esta forma la vida organizada de manera legalista ha mostrado su inhabilidad de defenderse a s misma contra la corrosi n del mal

1348658 british army officer and a british civilian between 8 february and 10 february 2007
1348659 they were on the streets by 1 april when they had turned the training mission into a support mission
1348660 didnt keep their part of the bargain as in april 2008 they participated in military operations in basra
1348661 if the delay in fighting in march april 2008 was due to a deal the only people who would have known would have been the defence minister the defence chief a very senior commander in the field and some planners
1348662 the command has to maintain morale it cant be seen to do a deal with people who have killed soldiers mates that would make the government as popular as a bag of puke
1348663 they were on the streets by 1 april when they had turned the training mission into a support mission

1348674 the question here is much bigger than the state of roraima its a question of national integration
1348675 not just on the part of indians but from land grabbers prospectors and loggers who would take it as a signal that reservations could be invaded
1348676 if they decide against us it would be the worst thing that can happen to indigenous people across brazil
1348677 those people the settlers think their contribution to the economy and their control of the local institutions make them right
1348678 in reflection of how critical it has become for the us military to retain native language and cultural know how in its ranks
1348679 the militarys conventional language training program the defense language institute in monterey calif could not churn out enough american soldiers proficient in arabic kurdish dari pashtu and farsi and the military quickly turned to private contractors to fill the gap
1348680 numerous programs have sprouted up including one at fort lewis wash where soldiers are given a 10 month immersion program in language and culture
1348681 can we marry up those two or maybe thats the wrong word can we have some kind of union of those two issues
1348682 well it seems that the military has gone around and fired a whole bunch of people who speak foreign languages farsi and arabic etc
1348683 for some reason the military seems more afraid of gay people than they are against terrorists but theyre very brave with the terrorists if the terrorists ever got a hold of this information theyd get a platoon of lesbians to chase us out of baghdad
1348684 the dont ask dont tell policy is not only wasteful and inefficient its unfair and un american in the middle of a war we are throwing out good people who have volunteered to put their lives on the line for their country

1348687 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1348688 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires

1348693 tonight was a chance to see where we stand and i look forward to seeing them again
1348694 for me its about intensity and getting better every day and weve done that this is a great win for us

1348704 but i want to be able to say that mohammed had some reprehensible qualities without being thrown in jail without being demonised
1348705 the best thing people can do is stay at home and never get out of bed
1348706 i have never felt so concerned about a single policy issue in my professional life the reason is because it is being fundamentally misconstrued under the model by being a good global citizen australia by its own actions loses competitiveness against countries free riding on our efforts these countries gain from being slow to act or not acting at all as production shifts to them their imports decline and their exports increase the architecture of the policy is misconceived
1348707 if we cannot cut a deal on global trade liberalisation where even unilateral action confers benefits on most if not all countries what chance do we have of cutting a deal where such action confers zero or negative benefits and we only gain if we all move together
1348708 commercially the us china and india and others are unlikely to act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions based on an emissions trading system production based model recession or even slowing economic growth make such expectations laughable jobs are already being lost
1348709 no more losses will be acceptable for promotion of distant climate change objectives
1348710 attempts to control australian production are likely to drive it offshore with less stringent or no policy controls over emissions
1348711 in a world where all countries acted together to deal with greenhouse gas emissions it wouldnt matter whether we targeted production or consumption but realistically we assume countries will not act together in this situation the difference between production and consumption is crucial
1348712 sets up incentives to shift local production economic activity and employment whether for exports or for import competition offshore
1348713 diverting production employment and trade to countries not acting in the same way to curb greenhouse gas emissions production
1348714 it cannot work or work very well in a world where producers can relocate production to where its most cost advantageous
1348715 carried to their logical and equitable conclusion would carve out all exports and all import competing local production
1348716 imagine the uproar if john howard had proposed a gst that hit exports and exempted imports instead of the other way around effectively that is the starting point for the current government this seems to be a policy no brainer
1348717 i was in the next room eating lunch when he went behind my desk
1348718 for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all our fathers
1348719 wir hoffen dass wir mindestens zwei drittel der stellen erhalten k nnen
1348720 currently all security measures relating to the olympic games have been implemented in a comprehensive manner and we are prepared to respond to all kinds of security threats
1348721 its taking longer for companies to pull the trigger on a purchase
1348722 we could get 3 to 5 inches of rain but the ground is dry and i dont think that will be a major issue
1348723 were preparing for a category 2 though we believe it wont be that severe
1348724 most boat owners are moving loose debris putting out extra bumpers doubling lines checking batteries and topping off freshwater in case something happens with the water lines here
1348725 until all the danger is past and then well start bringing it back up
1348726 obviously were ready to make adjustments if the weather changes but at this point we dont see any impact on our production
1348727 i believe theres a media ten dency to over exaggerate the reality of the truth it scares people who are not from coastal cities
1348728 we want to get it all in today before the storm gets here
1348729 i expect a 40 percent to 50 percent business disruption for two days or more
1348730 on thursday well probably get back in line with normal summer business
1348731 a lot of merchants in the restaurant industry are kind of monitoring their orders so they dont have too much in the refrigerator or freezer that could go bad
1348732 theres always a gray area about what caused what first
1348733 if its a category 4 storm theres usually no one around to see it
1348734 i think in this area they understand a little better than other areas
1348735 hey check out our new video it is called puppet masters and it is about
1348736 its very canadian of them very forward thinking im very proud canada kfc was the first to do it hopefully everyone else follows suit
1348737 why am i such a misfit i am not such a nit wit you cant fire me i quit seems i dont fit in
1348738 have a list of pet friendly hotels veterinary clinics and boarding facilities in or around the town your are evacuating to
1348739 a lot of animals that died during rita were cases of overheating because of power outages not because of the storm
1348740 cats are more attached to their territory than to their owner
1348741 its important to keep them comfortable while they are contained for long periods of time
1348742 this is kind of what they were saying earlier with what happened with hurricane alicia
1348743 it was nothing big but as time progressed it became a category 3 hurricane
1348744 ive got water batteries bread canned goods and a couple pieces of fruit just in case
1348745 youve got to in case its a couple of days
1348746 i have a freezer full of food that im going to have to eat
1348747 the st laurences incident is something that is of great concern and we need to monitor this very closely
1348748 you cant get more of a reminder than that to obey the speed limit
1348749 we can do as much enforcement as we like but it comes down to the individuals decisions
1348750 its about time mr rudd came clean with australians and admitted that he hasnt really got any real solution for the price of petrol or for the price of groceries
1348751 it is all spin and no substance and certainly will not reduce prices
1348752 clem liked campbell and had a high regard for him
1348753 clem of course was the original can do mayor who sewered brisbane and laid the bitumen his generosity was legendary and he had an amazing effect on peoples lives
1348754 i think he would be a bit embarrassed about it really
1348755 bear in mind theres an operator in the centre of the ride who watches it going around theres an attendant on the side of the ride who is able to jump on as its moving without any problem

1348804 while those at the top of the income scale are prospering since the 1990s income has actually declined for workers at the bottom rung and increased only slightly for middle class workers
1348805 the existence and expansion of this gap strikes at the heart of our core economic values
1348806 every year that productivity rises but middle incomes stagnate poverty increases and children are blocked from the opportunities to realize their potential is another year in which the basic american economic contract is broken

1348864 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
1348865 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know

1349002 this is my ppv of the year so far as we got another great ppv effort from roh the last 80 minutes of the ppv may have been the best of the year as the fight without honor the roh title match and roh tag title main event were an amazing close to the show
1349003 we are not dreamers at all when we talk about investing 132bn 66billion were thinking on a different plane because we cannot afford to think like everyone else were thinking about something that might seem unimaginable were going to outmanoeuvre everybody who is going to remain in the old mode of thinking about economic prospects

1349006 but what if your dependent care costs are more than what the flex spending account allows you to spend
1349007 now the story of christ is simply a true myth a myth working on us in the same way as the others but with this tremendous difference that it really happened and one must be content to accept it in the same way remembering that it is gods myth where the others are mens myths i e the pagan stories are god expressing himself through the minds of poets using such images as he found there while christianity is god expressing himself through what we call real things therefore it is true not in the sense of being a description of god that no finite mind could take in but in the sense of being the way in which god chooses to or can appear to our faculties the doctrines we get out of the true myth are of course less true they are translations into our concepts and ideas of that which god has already expressed in a language more adequate namely the actual incarnation crucifixion and resurrection does this amount to a belief in christianity at any rate i am now certain a that this christian story is to be approached in a sense as i approach the other myths b that it is the most important and full of meaning i am also nearly certain that it really happened
1349008 non servono inviti e i boicottaggi non hanno mai avuto effetti
1349009 il gesto dellatleta tedesca imke duplitzer che ha annunciato di non prendere parte alla cerimonia inaugurale dei giochi per protesta contro il mancato rispetto dei diritti umani in cina sia da stimolo per tutti gli atleti compresi quelli italiani
1349010 si tratta aggiunge di un gesto simbolico che dovrebbe invitare tutti a riflettere su quei principi fondamentali pace libert e democrazia che non possono essere messi in secondo piano
1349011 dagli atleti azzurri serve un gesto forte ed in questo senso anche disertare linaugurazione sarebbe un segnale importante da dare visto che il problema dei diritti in cina sembra ormai caduto nel dimenticatoio
1349012 when you have been in charge a long time like koebi kuhn you call up players out of gratitude
1349013 i will be naming some new players in order to encourage competition
1349014 the external environment has deteriorated and the consequences of this for northern rock are increased credit losses
1349015 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership
1349016 the only people that are left holding mortgages at northern rock are really those that are unable to find alternative mortgage providers and they are very high risk people
1349017 we are convinced that this conspiracy is being led by the state president against our president

1349019 after a careful and thorough review we made the strategic decision to sell our investment in this joint venture to sony a step that we believe will benefit the stakeholders of both our companies
1349020 this move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas
1349021 a deeper and more robust integration between the wide ranging global assets of the music company and sonys products

1349035 can spam is just a start permission in fact is the foundation of customer relevance and trust
1349036 in the early days of email the open rate was a valued metric because it captured who opened and by inference who then viewed or read the email today the preview pane and image blocking have turned the open metric into a tired inaccurate and irrelevant metric that no longer measures what it was originally intended to
1349037 consumers and the isps control the ecosystem yes increased frequency can often deliver short term results but it also increases list churn through higher spam complaints and unsubscribes and subsequently higher acquisition costs to replace the lost customers and revenue
1349038 there is however no magic pixie dust to sprinkle on the email list to get high delivery rates it simply requires following well publicized best practices
1349039 yes growing your email database is important because youll typically lose about one third of your list annually through normal churn additionally various studies suggest that one to two thirds or more of your list members are actually inactive no opens or clicks for some extended time frame
1349040 no it isnt advances in email marketing software now make sophisticated techniques such as lifecycle trigger and behavior based email programs possible for marketers at all tiers
1349041 my puzzle was the whole doctrine of redemption in what sense the life and death of christ saved or opened salvation to the world i could see how miraculous salvation might be necessary one could see from ordinary experience how sin e g the case of a drunkard could get a man to such a point that he was bound to reach hell i e complete degradation and misery in this life unless something quite beyond mere natural help or effort stepped in and i could well imagine a whole world being in the same state and similarly in need of miracle what i couldnt see was how the life and death of someone else whoever he was 2000 years ago could help us here and now except in so far as his example helped us and the example business tho true and important is not christianity right in the centre of christianity in the gospels and st paul you keep on getting something quite different and very mysterious expressed in those phrases i have so often ridiculed propitiation sacrifice the blood of the lamb expressions which i could only interpret in senses that seemed to me either silly or shocking
1349042 what stands out as important is emc has done so much at once
1349043 its a fairly long list i dont think theyve ducked anything
1349044 i have not heard anything whisper or not about problems on the symmetrix
1349045 its an indication of where the market is going that iscsi is standard
1349046 this is the quiet devolution a transfer of authority from the centre to the regions it has been going on unnoticed since the collapse of the constitutional talks in the 1990s knowing that mending the constitution is almost impossible in canada administrative federalism has become the new modus operandi at a time when canada is falling behind the rest of the industrialized world in health care urban renewal high speed rail energy conservation and other critical areas see the recent report card of the conference board of canada the federal answer is not to lead a national effort seeking national solutions it is not to speak for canada it is not to worry about the balkanization of the worlds most decentralized country or the rise of a destructive sectionalism or the ebbing attachment of its citizens to the idea of canada which is now becoming an association of princely states duchies and caliphates run by regional pashas no it is to impoverish and diminish the federal government and to do it by stealth
1349047 thats great but who cares about getting half the signal

1349050 back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
1349051 portray a false link between husseins regime and al qaeda as a justification for the iraq war
1349052 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1349053 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1349054 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1349055 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1349056 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1349057 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1349058 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1349059 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1349060 maybe all these sources are just making stuff up maybe but thats a helluva similar pattern of allegations isnt it
1349061 if you live feeling like your glass is half empty well it may as well be empty

1349064 he brother warnie and i even went together to church twice and will you believe it he said to me in conversation that he was beginning to think the religious view of things was after all true mind you like me at first he didnt want it to be nor like it but his intellect is beginning to revolt from the semi scientific assumptions we all grew up in and the other explanation of the world seems to him daily more probable
1349065 ok please give me the courage lord to speak what i should amen
1349066 my jesus my saviour lord there is none like you
1349067 i think the trouble with me is lack of faith i have no rational ground for going back on the arguments that convinced me of gods existence but the irrational deadweight of my old sceptical habits and the spirit of this age and the cares of the day steal away all my lively feeling of the truth and often when i pray i wonder if i am not posting letters to a non existent address mind you i dont think so the whole of my reasonable mind is convinced but i often feel so however there is nothing to do but to peg away one falls so often that it hardly seems worth while picking oneself up and going through the farce of starting over again as if you could ever hope to walk still this seeming absurdity is the only sensible thing i do so i must continue it and all the time on the other side the imaginative side the fairy angel i get such glimpses and vanishing memories as often take my breath away as if they said look what youre losing as if they were there just to deprive one of all excuse

1349070 the old doctrine is quite true you know that one must attribute everything to the grace of god and nothing to oneself yet as long as one is a conceited ass there is no good pretending not to be my self satisfaction cannot be hidden from god whether i express it to you or not rather the little bit of self satisfaction which i probably wrongly believe myself to be fighting against is probably merely a drop in the bottomless ocean of vanity and self approval which the great eye or great i sees in me
1349071 why must you always be eating things that upset your tummy

1349117 so much has been written about mothers and daughters and some of it by me

1349125 breast feeding is not only the most natural its the best for her
1349126 its well documented the higher the income level the higher the education level the more moms are breast feeding
1349127 in busy practices in rural areas many doctors dont have a lot of time for education
1349128 some of these moms have never seen other moms breast feeding
1349129 in our culture weve gotten away from breast feeding as the norm
1349130 we look at our breasts as sexual things instead of a benefit for mom and baby
1349131 but im going to give it a shot instead of lugging 1 200 flash cards around
1349132 very low cost of doing business and very high margins thats kind of the sweet spot for any business

1349150 companies now have a compelling and some might say urgent business case to support the development and implementation of a formal and strategic anti corruption program
1349151 between true globalisation of the worlds economy and the increased demand for greater transparency on how corporations conduct business a companys well earned ethical reputation can be at risk if not properly safeguarded with sufficient anticorruption efforts
1349152 weve made this special report available to help companies better understand the growing risk of doing nothing about anti corruption

1349156 we need to change the ways we grow distribute and eat food which needs to be good clean and fair things are at a crisis point with respect to health and the environment
1349157 we have been talking about a vegetable garden on the white house lawn this would be a way to talk about stewardship and nourishment thomas jefferson had such a garden
1349158 a big message of slow food nation is that we all need to be planting gardens
1349159 we need to have more greenhouses in the future whether it gets too hot or too cold

1349165 slow food is the opposite of fast food it is food that comes from local sustainable farms
1349166 we intend to raise awareness about the profound effects of our food choices on the environment on our health and on issues of social justice

1349174 i went to slow food nations parent terra madre in italy
1349175 it was life changing i plan to go to slow food nation because i do not want to miss another chance for a life changing event
1349176 terra madre was a heart event it was a thrill to see families still making the food they have made for centuries you feel this human thing it was very emotional and made me cry some recipes for corn bread for example had been handed down for twenty generations
1349177 i love the apple farmers here in sonoma county they are courageous there is a history here that we need to remember
1349178 slow food is an opportunity to re connect with our food and local growers and to understand the plight our planet is in our immunity and the immune system of the earth are linked building from here is a source of our healing
1349179 it helps create a sense of what real nourishment is it brings farmers children and the community back into the food system rather than leaving it in the hands of large corporations slow food encourages people to grow and cook their own food and remember the pleasure in that
1349180 it was intense being around people from over 150 countries in their traditional dress who have this common bond and language of the land growing food preserving local food cultures preparing serving and nourishing others
1349181 they have a delicious heritage bean they so inspired me that i bought them as christmas presents and included information about slow food

1349187 they want an interactive education they are happy to be in the garden kids are not just hungry for food they are hungry for people to take care of them and for nature
1349188 as ralph nader described it that was enshrined in the wto it was this synergy between the massive protests in the streets and the rebellion of developing countries at the seattle convention center that resulted in the spectacular collapse of the so called

1349192 my grandfather sweated and suffered so much in that lace mill that bill and i vowed that no one in pennsylvania would ever again have to work in a factory with nafta and pntr our dream has been realized
1349193 increasingly i found myself spending time with people of means law firm partners and investment bankers hedge fund managers and venture capitalists as a rule they were smart interesting people knowledgeable about public policy liberal in their politics expecting nothing more than a hearing of their opinions in exchange for their checks
1349194 i was candid i had no problem telling well heeled supporters that the tax cuts theyd received from george bush should be reversed
1349195 my own worldview and theirs corresponded in many ways i had gone to the same schools after all had read the same books and worried about my kids in many of the same ways
1349196 i know as a consequence of my fund raising i became more like the wealthy donors i met in the very particular sense that i spent more and more of my time above the fray outside the world of immediate hunger disappointment fear irrationality and frequent hardship of the other 99 percent of the population
1349197 hard to deny rubins basic insight we can try to slow globalization but we cant stop it

1349202 bila kamu sadari sang pencipta telah menciptakan banyak hal untuk kita ambil hasilnya bila aku lapar dia telah menciptakan kita buah dan hewan untuk kita makan atau kita juga bisa menjualnya
1349203 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
1349204 in the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
1349205 bush says offshore drilling could yield up to 18 billion barrels of oil over time although it would take years for production to start

1349208 the best blogger in the state and a more talented natural economist than any of those pointy headed keynesian halfwits
1349209 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame

1349212 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
1349213 this is a victory for us but this is an initial victory in a long battle we have involve in
1349214 we have shed blood before we are not saying that we have enjoyed it but we are willing to make sacrifices
1349215 this is to convince the people that this is it and that we are not selling you out to the moro people or the milf this is the best way we can do to resolve the centuries old problem in mindanao

1349219 everyone was expecting belga to be the leader of this team now that jason castro is moving on to the pro ranks but most of the time he usually would show up by constantly getting in foul trouble a usual practice during his pbl stint with harbour centre and at times even blaming his own teammates
1349220 with a dismal zero point five rebound effort on the following game
1349221 i know so far that at least twelve senators have signed but we are still circulating it we only need eleven because the total number in the committee is only twenty
1349222 we already have twelve yesterday and i dont know of any more they are able to gather that is only to authorize me to make the committee report and sponsor it tomorrow our problem is to get the two thirds vote
1349223 my hopes are high that we will be able to get the two thirds vote that would be around fifteen or sixteen we already had twelve yesterday and we might even be able get that vote at the committee level alone in effect that will be anti climactic if we get fifteen or sixteen
1349224 enter into an exchange of notes so that all constitutional provisions in our philippine constitution that conflict with jpepa will be deemed dominant or superior to the jpepa provisions
1349225 it is edging towards ratification and i hope that will convince them tomorrow because we will lose a lot in terms of economic benefits if we do not concur

1349228 parents of primary schoolchildren will start getting letters next month telling them how fat their children are under government plans to tackle childhood obesity
1349229 friends of the earth action endorsed barack obama in may in large part because he spoke out against the gas tax holiday gimmick that would have done nothing to reduce our dependence on oil
1349230 thats why its so disappointing to see obama now say he would consider expanding offshore drilling even though he knows it is not a real solution to the energy crisis that is devastating our environment and our economy
1349231 i mean at some point you can say lets compromise but you keep giving away more and more
1349232 this is like a blt sandwich with just the lettuce and tomato
1349233 theres no bacon weve got to have things that really move us away from our addiction to oil and help solve global warming this proposal doesnt get it done
1349234 once we have a new president and more forward thinking members in the house and senate we dont believe we will need a compromise on offshore drilling which will be yet another giveaway to big oil and will provide no relief for hard hit consumers
1349235 we will resist any effort to pay this ransom which george bush john mccain and big oil are demanding in exchange for the release of real investments in clean renewable energy
1349236 sen obamas plan will put america on the path to a clean energy future because it prioritizes efforts that will benefit working families instead of the outdated fossil fuel industries
1349237 sen obama supports creating millions of jobs by investing in the cleanest cheapest and fastest technologies to meet our energy needs and stimulate our economy
1349238 the short term problem is that americans are really hurting on gas prices
1349239 it would just be really foolish of us to be completely ignorant of that fact releasing oil from the reserve would hopefully take some of the pressure off the folks who are feeling pressure who dont want to be for drilling but theyre not sure that they have a choice at this point because of public demand
1349240 its not posing any risk to our security at all to sell a small amount of oil

1349258 apabila seseorang akan masuk ke suatu rumah yang tidak berpenghuni maka hendaklah ia mengucapkan
1349259 keselamatan bagi kalian dan kami dan bagi hamba alloh yang sholih
1349260 bahwasanya ada seseorang yang lewat sedangkan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam sedang buang air kecil orang itu memberi salam namun beliau tidak menjawabnya
1349261 janganlah kalian terlebih dahulu memberi salam kepada orang orang yahudi dan nasrani
1349262 engkau memberikan makanan dan memberi salam kepada orang yang telah kamu kenal dan yang belum kamu kenal
1349263 janganlah kalian memberi salam seperti orang orang yahudi dan nasrani karena sesungguhnya cara penyampaian mereka memakai isyarat dengan tangan
1349264 tiada dua orang muslim yang saling berjumpa lalu berjabat tangan melainkan diampuni dosa keduanya sebelum mereka berpisah

1349338 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
1349339 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
1349340 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006
1349341 the united states military has the capacity to direct a missile to a precise location at very short notice as it has done close to 20 times in the last few years to hit al qaeda targets inside pakistan

1349405 it was like he had to give it to me
1349406 it was clear that jason knew what had happened to nicholas
1349407 his hair was dark but bleached blond and the roots were quite obvious
1349408 beverly said how dare you say hes not my son
1349409 i go to her house to get a blood sample and she lies on the floor and says shes not going to get up

1349423 im the worlds worst liar i cant lie worth crap
1349424 totally wacko a completely different person and it was scary
1349425 we just kept making excuses that hes different because of all this ugly stuff that had happened
1349426 i couldnt bond with him i just didnt have that feeling my heart went out for him but not like a mothers would the kids a mess and its sad and i wouldnt wish that on anybody
1349427 his teeth were different his voice was different his ears were smaller
1349428 one thing a mother ought to know was the identity of her child
1349429 he has lied and lied and lied again and to this day he continues to lie he bears no remorse
1349430 i feel sorry for him you know we got to know him and this kid has been through hell he has a lot of nervous habits
1349431 he did a lot of things that took a lot of guts if you think about it
1349432 i apologize to all the people in my past for what i have done i wish i wish that you believe me but i know its impossible
1349433 i told him what interests me in his life wasnt the way he bent the truth but why he did that and the things that he looked for
1349434 youre not a dad for six days or six months it is not a character it is a reality
1349435 the prognosis seems more than worrying we are very pessimistic about modifying these personality traits
1349436 when confronted with his misconduct the psychopath has enough false sincerity and apparent remorse that he renews hope and trust among his accusers
1349437 ive seen him now for two years and he is not that person
1349438 it doesnt matter i dont need my child to be perfect all i want is that this child feels love
1349439 it is ok now and i will explain everything later

1349498 i have been doing comedy in the valley with nano ramirez for the better part of 10 years
1349499 nano has been instrumental in me getting in front of huge crowds that arent exactly there for comedy
1349500 he has let me show them that comedy is still around and live comedy can be the best form of stress release there is there is something about a live crowd and the raw unpredictability that you cant get from watching a tv set

1349509 adenosines scientific team has made promising discoveries relating to genetic variants in adenosine receptors and disease states such as diabetes we believe that pursuing biomarker strategies from the early stages of clinical trials will enable us to realize a more efficient development pathway resulting in drugs targeted to the segment of the patient population most likely to respond
1349510 this deal was made on very favorable terms and is precisely the sort of opportunity we have been seeking to leverage our pharmacogenomic expertise against a promising set of clinical and preclinical drug candidates in addition our cardiology sales force may be expanded to handle the launch of stedivaze once marketing approval of that drug is obtained

1349556 president george w bush asked congress on friday for 172 million in additional fiscal 2009 agriculture department funding to implement the new u s farm law and to improve the usda computer system
1349557 the spending would be offset by a 287 million cut in the environmental quality incentives program bush proposed the usda revisions as part of budgetary changes for eight departments and the environmental protection agency
1349558 the white house requested 117 million for upgrading the farm service agency computer system and 55 million for additional workers to cope with farm program revisions

1349561 president bush also asked for about 1 billion in added fiscal 2009 funding for bioterrorism programs to be offset by cutting the social services block grant program
1349562 congress is unlikely to go along with the proposed funding shuffles particularly since the ink is barely dry on the five year farm bill pl 110 246 enacted in late june over bushs veto

1349565 192 3 million in proposed decreases within the department to fully offset the farm

1349626 trends in hiv and std related risk behaviors among high school students united states 1991 2007
1349627 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
1349628 the responses to hiv and aids require long term and sustained financing as more people go on treatment and live longer budgets will have to increase considerably over the next few decades in the most affected countries donors will have to provide the majority of the funding
1349629 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
1349630 we must categorically reject any attempt to so called normalize aids or treat this epidemic as just one of many medical problems
1349631 aids is the most complex the most challenging and probably the most demanding infectious disease humanity has ever had to face
1349632 we dare not let down our guard we are going to be in this for the long haul
1349633 many of us want to be doctors or teachers i want to be a singer but these dreams will only be possible when we have medicines when were accepted in schools and when we can grow up in an atmosphere free from violence stigma and discrimination
1349634 there has been a spectacular advance but we are still very short of the mark
1349635 one of the tasks of the conference is to address the fact that there are three million people who now get the drugs but another nine million who do not
1349636 after so much progress it appears that we are poised to accept defeat when victory is still within our grasp
1349637 i dont believe for a moment this could break the bank there is a humanitarian necessity of investing in prevention
1349638 hiv has spawned an interest in health systems that was never there before and investment in hiv is helping to drive the expansion of public health systems globally to reach all those who need it
1349639 no doubt that in order for us to achieve the 2010 universal access targets health systems must be further strengthened
1349640 stigma discrimination and human rights would indeed be the focus of the conference
1349641 we are in an interesting and some would say difficult period
1349642 there has been a sense that every vaccine trial is do or die
1349643 most people dont understand that the product development process is rife with failures the assumption is most candidates wont work we are just looking for any signal of hope
1349644 s omething like prep has a good chance of becoming available before we have a 100 efficacious vaccine
1349645 the challenges are a little less daunting if we have that tool it could have a very big impact
1349646 believe that having their menthol cigarettes snatched away may be just what they need to end their habit

1349648 this is a very personal decision and you dont need anybody to tell you what you can or cant do
1349649 i dont say you should stop smoking i give encouragement to quit i tell them i saved 139 in the first month
1349650 any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
1349651 i understand that people should have choices about whether they prescribe these medications but i do think if you are against it you are obligated to have someone else offer that information we are obligated to protect and do our best
1349652 it just says allow diversity allow professionals to keep their integrity you cant allow people to violate their integrity with what they feel are unconscionable acts
1349653 gp consolidation on any significant scale could dislocate the existing accessible community based network of pharmaceutical care nhs planners should not act in haste to push co location at the expense of genuine integration of services
1349654 new facilities for the nhs are welcome but the decision on where new healthcentres are to be located and how they integrate with existing care networks must be underpinned by a rounded assessment of the full potential impact on services and communities surrounding the new development including those not in the direct vicinity
1349655 we are asking pcts to commit to a neighbourhood access analysis that assesses whether a care void could be created in pockets and considers the potential for expanding community pharmacy based services and other genuinely community based services to ensure continued indeed improved access to services such an analysis could be incorporated into health inequality impact assess for any new developments including lift projects
1349656 answer the most pressing questions about what works in health care
1349657 we will work to move the bill this year but obviously time is very limited
1349658 it is important to start serious discussion on an issue important to consider in the context of health reform
1349659 we very much support this notion of a public private independent organization
1349660 a down payment on the agenda of most stakeholders which is to get all americans covered
1349661 promoting comparative effectiveness research we can improve quality value and expand coverage for all
1349662 a research agenda that targets the most costly types of treatments and produces findings that shrinks demand for those treatments may not sit well with individual drug device and medical professionals affected
1349663 supports the development and use of high quality evidence for health care decision making
1349664 and avoid denying or delaying patients access to beneficial care
1349665 safeguards should be included to ensure that the final determination of what treatment option works best for each patient should be made by individuals and their physicians
1349666 research should focus on comparative clinical effectiveness and not on cost effectiveness which could lead to decision making that may not be in the best interest of patients
1349667 we knew we were locked into an r rating from the language in the beginning of the movie anyway from all the war movie dialogue
1349668 you just have to do that if youre doing a war movie i think a lot of these studio guys talk like that i know from personal experience i have heard people in movie studios curse
1349669 we believe the commercial is exceptional and hits the mark for secret obsession
1349670 theyre at the very top of their game and are the best at what they do youd expect them to be at the top of the scale
1349671 trigger doesnt actually require any cost savings much less real discipline
1349672 all it does is oblige the political class to nod at medicares deteriorating finances
1349673 would merely slow the rate of spending growth enough to shut off the 45 trigger
1349674 the trigger reminds people of how spendthrift and taxing the budget for medicare already is even when its reserved only for seniors
1349675 a vote might draw attention from the otherwise sleepy capitol hill press corps
1349676 democrats have tried repeatedly since 2006 to abolish the trigger because it gets in the way of their health care agenda
1349677 has plans for a slow motion roll toward medicare for all the ultimate goal of democratic health policy
1349678 the house vote stalls action until the next administration when democrats will almost certainly dump the trigger entirely
1349679 heavy on obamas message of change a theme that helped him win his partys nomination
1349680 a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government
1349681 while there are differing approaches within the party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage we stand united to achieve this fundamental objective through the legislative process
1349682 theres no real consensus yet on which is the best health care reform to do other than we are committed to universality and were committed to getting there
1349683 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
1349684 primarily from promoting the use of electronic medical records controlling administrative costs and emphasizing preventive care and the management of chronic diseases
1349685 time frame for such a remarkable turnaround is overly optimistic
1349686 clash of political interests that have impeded an overhaul for more than a decade
1349687 more important still there is little solid evidence the proposed changes will yield the size of estimated savings
1349688 loaded up their crash carts with plenty of life saving tools
1349689 ready to apply the paddles to the heart of americas ailing health care system
1349690 mccains health plan for instance calls for dabbling a bit in experimental medicine while obamas hopes could exceed his healing powers
1349691 modernizing the health care system with greater use of technology driving down drug prices through competition targeting better prevention and management of chronic diseases promoting quality care and coordinating patient care more closely
1349692 in terms of getting coverage to the uninsured obama appears to have the better plan
1349693 could flop because it lacks a mandate that the uninsured actually purchase those newly affordable health plans
1349694 remedy for obama is easy embrace a universal mandate for all americans to buy health insurance then find the means to help them purchase that coverage
1349695 his proposal to expand access to insurance seems bound to unnecessarily tick off the millions of people who have workplace insurance
1349696 a solid answer for covering those americans whose existing illnesses prevent them from finding insurance at almost any price
1349697 mccain isnt wrong to explore moving away from workplace based health insurance
1349698 for his plan to work mccain would have to embrace
1349699 both presidential candidates have to decide whether theyre really willing to follow through on the treatments theyre prescribing

1349804 me and my wife thought it would be fun to christen our daughter in such a priceless object
1349805 when youre in a rebuilding process you have to keep your eyes on two things whats in front of you and where you want to go
1349806 if you have a very good team in place its easy to focus on the next game when youre dealing with young players it changes day to day week to week month to month thats what i mean about the difficulty of the job
1349807 i think what i mean when i say the toughest job is its more multi tasking we want to put together a nucleus that can stick together sometimes theres no good or bad coaches its right fit the no 1 thing is that getting young is a process hes been through the process
1349808 he knows and distinguishes those who are kissing his butt from those who are busting their butt
1349809 i did think i would get another head coaching job someday
1349810 its a great opportunity the opportunity to work with good people the opportunity to work with a team that has a plan
1349811 im coming into this job with my eyes wide open we have some very good young hockey players in this organization right now this is a very difficult league to play in this is a mans league were young were going to get younger we need to get younger we need to get the young guys going
1349812 its going to be hard ill tell you that right now
1349813 when i took over the flyers we had missed the playoffs five times in a row im hoping to draw on that experience bring it here get it going in the right way
1349814 my philosophy coming in its patience its communication its on ice structure the expectations are to become better its a process we know whats in front of us were going to follow that plan
1349815 doing things the right way is everything we want to become a good team down the road thats the important thing
1349816 as far as the core right now it doesnt measure up
1349817 thats what youre trying to build it doesnt match up right now
1349818 the amount of work thats been put in from the end of the season to now is incredible we as a coaching staff are required to put in the same kind of work as we work our way to the other side were going to have some young players who are going to be the core of this hockey club
1349819 i need to go through that with the people here real soon
1349820 i hope to accelerate that and get it done quickly

1349829 its probably the most common question i get in interviews and that question goes way back to when my kindergarten teacher asked if i was related to phil and tony esposito

1349836 john did an exceptional job in his first full season as a head coach in the nhl and of our hockey club
1349837 he and his staff worked well together and he is very deserving of this award
1349838 to me this is more of an organizational award than a coaching award
1349839 i think that its a reflection of all the good things done from paul holmgren down to the players the honor was given to me but in my mind it should be given to the entire organization for all the work that everyone has done

1349847 for a franchise that had never won a playoff series had been to the playoffs once in its existence never won a division title and had never even dreamed of winning a stanley cup in my mind thats incredible pressure that lecavalier faced
1349848 were not asking him to come in and save the franchise
1349849 my goal coming into this season was to get as drafted as high as possible
1349850 i think im a guy who works very hard and if i want something bad enough im going to do anything possible to get it
1349851 i think his potential is that he can be a legitimate star player in the national hockey league
1349852 thats not what we expect right off the bat but i think when you look 10 years down the road i think hes going to be really special

1349862 there was a lot of stress placed on the knee
1349863 especially with being on the ice three hours and in the weight room for two hours a day it held up pretty well all week
1349864 thats obviously a big honor for me especially where nobody from our league got picked in the first round
1349865 it was a little bit of a disappointment for our league but its a huge honor for me to be the first guy picked
1349866 its a dream come true to be drafted by an nhl team and i couldnt say enough about how honored and proud i am

1349890 its hard to tell parents how to interact with their children based on one study but what we see here is that parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to try to direct and control their children during a play period
1349891 as a result these children were less cooperative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
1349892 of course all parents direct their children and people in general are always directing others to close a door or hand them something
1349893 its something we do all the time but there is a qualitative difference in the kinds of directing going on by these verbally aggressive mothers by looking at how and when directives occurred not just how often we found that moms who scored highest on verbal aggression used directives to control the child and ultimately the way the game or activity was played the aggressive action is not overt as in a parent hitting or yelling but these small negative maneuvers can say so much to a child
1349894 we all say things to our children that we regret saying but saying a lot of things that attack a childs self confidence is not healthy
1349895 these parents were in an unstructured low stress environment and if we saw this behavior in such a brief setting how could such negative interactions even so subtle affect a child over the long term for example if the parents always have to control what activity they and their children are going to play as well as for how long and how they are going to play it you wonder if this communicates to the child that what they want to do doesnt matter
1349896 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
1349897 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
1349898 we know so much about the harmful effects of exposure to violent media content but how much exposure children actually get has been largely ignored now were learning more about the large numbers of kids seeing this material and who they are
1349899 no expert in child development would advocate for subjecting children as young as 10 to this level of violence yet the study shows that such exposure is commonplace in this country
1349900 we should re think the current movie rating system which has been in place for 40 years and was designed when kids could only see movies in theaters ratings need to be more prominent on all movies whether they are seen in theaters or purchased in the store and we need clearer messages to parents pediatricians and child advocates should instruct parents to strictly abide by the movie age guidelines and to closely monitor movie viewing
1349901 community recreation and parks is the health provider that you dont know about
1349902 traditionally these agencies are considered as organizers of games and sports in a towns parks or ball fields but our study shows that 9 out of 10 recreation and park professionals are actively involved in a health partnership sometimes several of them
1349903 twenty years ago health care providers didnt consider recreation and park professionals to be a partner in the campaigns to promote health but in the 1990s community based health partnerships were starting to consider the role of recreation and parks in promoting physical activity and quality of life since many related programs are offered by recreation and park managers
1349904 health campaigns naturally involve recreation and park departments because they provide low cost close to home opportunities for physical activity such as trails recreation centers outdoor courts and outdoor swimming facilities
1349905 parks trails and recreation centers can also serve as settings for physical rehabilitation
1349906 having facilities is critical but then programs also have to be established to bring in residents and encourage them to take part
1349907 partnerships that include after school programs diet and nutritional information and policy efforts to promote recreational settings should be encouraged
1349908 the study was designed to provide baseline information on the state of current health partnership practices within the profession their successes and their challenges
1349909 such information can be used to help a community effectively develop a program in health and physical activity promotion
1349910 impacts on individual species indicate wider changes at the biome level that will potentially change conditions for many plant and animal species in addition to ecosystem services to humans
1349911 the central u s is characterized by an ecotone thats the intersection of forest in the east and grassland in the west
1349912 the border between these ecosystems is largely determined by climate variability and it is likely that climate change will shift the location of this and other ecological boundaries worldwide
1349913 lynx is one species that is vulnerable but the potential impacts of climate change on entire ecosystems are even more alarming
1349914 freshwater habs pose serious threats to human and ecological health this report assesses the state of knowledge about freshwater habs in the u s and sets research priorities to improve our ability to minimize or even prevent impacts of these events
1349915 the central importance of this report is that this is the first comprehensive look at harmful algal blooms in u s freshwaters
1349916 freshwater algal blooms are equally as important and problematic as those found in marine waters they can affect drinking water for the millions of people across the country who rely on surface fresh water supplies such as the great lakes
1349917 children who experience hostility abuse physical discipline and other aggressive behaviors by their parents are more likely to model that behavior in their peer relationships
1349918 children learn from their parents how to behave and interact with others
1349919 so if theyre learning about aggression and angry words at home they will tend to use these behaviors as coping mechanisms when they interact with their peers
1349920 has served as one of the primary contributors to its persistence and severity
1349921 it seems like the time has come to release the collection this year
1349922 im very proud of these songs they are timeless and have become classics in their own right
1349923 i first discovered this song by ash about six years ago and i simply couldnt stop listening to it its so exultant that it virtually shimmers
1349924 were still in the early stages but this is a lifelong commitment on my part
1349925 im coming out from behind my singing voice to express myself in broader terms and help give a voice to those who dont have the same opportunities as i do
1349926 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1349927 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1349928 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1349929 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded centre contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1349930 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from messier 87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1349931 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of messier 87
1349932 in messier 87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1349933 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1349934 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1349935 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters centre messier 87 sits at the centre of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the centre probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1349936 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time

1349947 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1349948 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
1349949 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1349950 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1349951 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons
1349952 george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house somehow they had this local exchange of information so what weve been working on is how we can use the local environment rather than a computer as a tasking medium to the robot
1349953 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us
1349954 but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention
1349955 when i stood there and looked at that packbot i realized that if that robot hadnt been there it would have been some kid
1349956 we have increased our forecast because there has already been a very active early tropical cyclone season in the deep tropics and more favorable hurricane enhancing sea surface temperature and sea level pressure patterns in the tropical atlantic have developed
1349957 the primary concern with our current very active seasonal forecast numbers is the continued ocean surface warming in the eastern and central tropical pacific although it seems unlikely at this point there is a possibility that a weak el nino could develop by the latter part of the hurricane season if this happened it would likely reduce the number of late season tropical cyclones
1349958 we expect the atlantic basin tropical cyclone season will be very active with activity that is about 190 percent of the long term average
1349959 we base our predictions on long period statistical models constructed on the past 60 years of historical data residents should take these forecasts as an indication of what this years hurricane activity is likely to be if the global atmosphere and ocean behave in the next few months as they have over the last 60 years no seasonal forecasts can determine when or where storms are going to strike so coastal residents should take precautions during hurricane season and be prepared
1349960 the same factors that make individual months active or inactive are often not the same factors that make the entire season active or inactive
1349961 we are continually improving our forecasts to provide people with specific monthly hurricane forecasts along with landfall probability forecasts
1349962 we are in an active cycle in the atlantic basin that is expected to last another 15 to 20 years we believe this is part of a natural ocean cycle and is not the result of human induced increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide
1349963 we have made dramatic advances in treatment of chronic illnesses like heart disease and high blood pressure
1349964 but many americans are locked out of the system because they are uninsured and cannot afford this life saving care
1349965 many of these individuals end up with preventable emergency room visits hospitalizations amputations kidney failure or worse because their chronic condition has gotten out of control
1349966 some plans for example require people to pay medical bills of 5 000 out of pocket before their insurance kicks in
1349967 these plans put people in the precarious state of being underinsured which is not that much better than lacking health insurance altogether
1349968 some claim that uninsured americans can get the care they need in emergency rooms
1349969 only national health insurance can fix this broken system and save thousands of lives each year
1349970 chronically ill and uninsured a national study of disease prevalence and access to care in u s adults
1349971 taking a long term perspective on ecosystem services highlights tradeoffs among services and points to the level at which management actions will be effective
1349972 its important to keep these tradeoffs in mind in order to develop realistic management goals
1349973 we often wring our hands trying to figure out how to put values on ecosystem services
1349974 we hope policy makers will take notice that there are costs associated with these economic activities that havent been accounted for previously
1349975 ecosystem services projects are far more likely to engage a wider variety of stakeholders drawing in private agricultural landowners and engaging funds from sources such as private corporations
1349976 the reformation notion of the priesthood of all believers by no means denigrated the pastoral office as is often assumed rather it taught that the pastoral office is a vocation a calling from god with its own responsibilities authority and blessings but it also taught that laypeople as well have vocations callings of their own that entail holy responsibilities authorities and blessings of their own all believers like the priests of the old testament can come into the presence of god through the blood of the lamb all believers can handle holy things such as the bible earlier denied to the laity all can proclaim the gospel to those who need its saving message the priesthood of all believers means that all christians enjoy the same access to christ and are spiritually equal before him the priesthood of all believers did not make everyone into church workers rather it turned every kind of work into a sacred calling every kind of work including what had heretofore been looked down upon the work of peasants and craftsmen is an occasion for priesthood for exercising a holy service to god and to ones neighbor
1349977 i am reading joshua harris book love it he talks about the people who believe they can be christians and never go to church i have heard this argument many times they dont believe you have to fellowship
1349978 there are always a few people who conspire to sabotage it is no longer a secret now
1349979 there are real problems in xinjiang but my assessment is that these people are well known and have been infiltrated by the chinese security apparatus
1349980 i call on the us government and the international community to condemn chinas manipulation of terror threats to kill and intimidate uighurs on the eve of the olympic games
1349981 my biggest concern is that an incident like this and the repression that follows could further polarise the uighur and han communities in xinjiang
1349982 i dont know what the people of ottawa thought about it the hug being sentimental and all but i couldnt help it
1349983 its an unbelievable dream come true weve talked about how cool it would be to be picked by the same team nashville is an unbelievable organization and im so proud to be a part of the predators the fact i have my best friend beside me is really exciting
1349984 we were practically attached to the hip when we were younger
1349985 hes a good friend of mine we speak on the phone nearly everyday when i told him ottawa picked him he was excited it was unbelievable that we were picked by the same team

1349993 and thats all he did was punch him hard yes
1349994 he made a bad decision it was a bad incident it he could take it back i assure you he would i do believe in second chances he should move on and i think we should too
1349995 his signing comes hot on the heels of owen nolans decision to jump ship for minnesota after a splendid comeback year with the flames last season
