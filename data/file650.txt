6500020 we always aim for a trifecta with our customers to create a beautiful product that is high in quality and at a price that doesnt offend we think we scored that again this year as even in this uncertain economy our customers have returned to us in spades they see our product as an investment that will last more than one season and most rewarding to me is that our shoes make them feel confident as they step out into an uncertain world
6500021 so it became obvious to us that we needed to reach them in ways that mattered to them our increased online presence and success therein can be directly linked to the fact that we reach them instantly with our newest offerings and the next instant they can purchase them
6500022 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6500023 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6500077 the new rpet trays represent a giant step and we could not be more appreciative to conagra for their commitment to this initiative
6500078 as a leading packaged foods company conagra foods can make a positive impact on the environment by finding new ways to reduce waste and our new frozen meal trays with post consumer recycled plastic will ensure that the equivalent of 128 million 20 ounce plastic bottles wont go to landfills each year
6500079 the beauty of the new rpet trays is that they meet the same performance specs as our popular cpet trays made from virgin crystallized pet plastic
6500080 the environmental impact incentive comes without tradeoffs for our customers we plan to eventually expand the availability of rpet trays to our other product lines of chilled and ready meal trays and to customers globally all our plants have production capability for the new rpet trays
6500081 pet is now the second most recycled material in the world and as the worlds leading supplier of cpet trays we feel it is important to provide the benefit of that leadership to our customers in order to enable them to include post consumer recycled material in their trays we intend to expand further this use of rpet and play our part in reducing the carbon footprint throughout the supply chain

6500112 this expedition started like many travels with a casual remark while drinking a beer with cycling friends you should know that for more than fifteen years our rowing team has done some voluntary cycling in the european mountains and to supplement the loss of moisture we would drink a beer now and then and while we were telling each other heroic cycling stories someone would come up with a brilliant plan some of those plans have from what we remembered the day after been worked out and a few have even been executed what we normally did was thinking of a nice place to go for a week and cycle as much as we could you might think that over the years those weeks became more like holidays and less like cycling up and down the mountains but that is not the case you could even say that we have become more crazie and after cycling almost every interesting pass in europe we ended up at everest at base camp of everest that is
6500113 few of the works of nature indeed are calculated to produce impressions of higher sublimity than the aspects of this coast as it is gradually unfolded to the eye of the mariner sailing on the distant waters of the pacific where mountain is seen to rise above mountain and chimborazo with its glorious canopy of snow glittering far above the clouds crowns the whole with a celestial diadem
6500114 so immense is the scale in which nature works in these regions that it is only when viewed from a great distance that the spectator can in any degree comprehend the relation of the several parts of the stupendous whole

6500128 it is not our business to praise mugabe or anybody we said the parties are close to reaching an agreement and so no one should force them to sign as it is not us the sadc membership who is negotiating it is the zimbabweans who are negotiating
6500129 who am i to declare that the negotiations have gone well and dictate to people to sign
6500130 even president mbeki does not have those powers to dictate to the parties to sign
6500131 what more does tsvangirai expect but we cannot order him to accept the agreement all we can do is try and persuade him to see sense
6500132 it was already 2 30am in the morning when the meeting ended i did not go to sleep but i read through the document until 4am and realised that the object of contention is executive power i offered a piece of advice and said no one should be bent on frustrating the other during the talks i never praised mugabe what for what has he done
6500133 i never said tsvangirai has misled us how can he mislead us have we ever sat down with him during the talks our political stance on zimbabwe was never influenced by what tsvangirai told us our decision emanated from the report by election observers that is the basis of our stance
6500134 i think somebody wanted to shame tsvangirai and forced the words into our mouths it is not our business to shame tsvangirai it is up to his people the zimbabweans to declare whether they have lost interest in him or not i was one of the people who said let the negotiations continue
6500135 you should remember that zanu pf people have been here twice to brief the president on the situation in zimbabwe when the mdc people come here we never make it a secret the first time tsvangirai came to see us i let the zimbabwean embassy know that he is here and that we did not invite him lest we are perceived to be taking sides
6500136 our doors remain open even the zanu pf people will be welcome we want to talk to every party perhaps there will be a solution
6500137 i was not alone there i was with several government officials who can attest on my behalf

6500144 quite conservative in its projections of obesity prevalence and estimates of attributable fractions for conditions associated with obesity diabetes cardiovascular disease various types of cancer and osteoarthritis
6500145 these new figures are tragic and frightening and represent a wake up call for the nation
6500146 they show that previous estimates of the epidemics size and cost were very much understated
6500147 we know that obesity and type two diabetes can be prevented and we need to make fundamental changes in the way we live to arrest the escalating crisis
6500148 for hundreds of thousands of australians this is the best news of their life and for many of those people had they been diagnosed with exactly the same cancer 20 years ago the outcome would have looked very different it continues to build australia as a leader internationally in cancer outcomes
6500149 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6500150 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6500151 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6500152 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6500153 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6500154 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our programme
6500155 i think its more than 7 but i guess it depends on how you count i suppose itll be okay if factcheck or similar calls obamas ad false like this
6500156 wtf guys i thought we were on the same team
6500157 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

6500176 this criminal behaviour serves to give more weight to the ever growing ground swell calling for the ifp to take over government and provide leadership and answers to plight of the majority
6500177 these acts of vandalism were equally an indictment against the anc government for it has failed for fourteen years to effectively banish poverty and hunger
6500178 the news of criminals who have threatened more sabotage of substations should shame both the anc and the involved criminals
6500179 it is clear from the poor working class poor communities that those who are rich and white will continue to be treated differently to those who are poor
6500180 we respect the rule of law but it is disgusting that there is a continued tendency or a systematic abortion of justice on matters related to the murder of black workers in the country
6500181 this reinforces our long held belief that the rule of law in this country favours the rich particularly whites and regards the lives of black workers as shallow and cheap

6500219 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6500220 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6500221 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6500222 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6500223 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting

6500230 in the past first time home buyers were willing to purchase older more basic houses in an effort to save money and break into homeownership
6500231 today this group has greater home expectations because they have grown up more accustomed to their parents lifestyles
6500232 first time home buyers now have higher standards placing an increased focus on the financial aspects of home ownership and at the same time want a larger home they can live in right away
6500233 in meiner heimat wird meist sehr jung geheiratet w hrend die jungen leute hier in sterreich zuerst an ihrer karriere arbeiten das finde ich gut so

6500237 so you must be the new computer instructor huh they told me youre here already
6500238 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6500239 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6500240 while he is still here he is very much 100 a tottenham player that is how we consider things it is not a case of finding a solution to a problem before it occurs
6500241 weve got a list of targets that we are working very hard on
6500242 negotiations are tough and sometimes they are even tougher than usual we know what we are working towards and we know what our objectives are
6500243 the process of signing players sometimes takes time but fans should be aware we are trying to strengthen up front and sign a new forward quite often these things take time
6500244 its true to say we have one or two areas that we need to look at defensively and maybe solve a few problems at the back
6500245 i would have much rather been playing a team who win but weve already played brazil so im quite pleased were playing them again brazil couldnt find a way through against our defensive system and there were periods of the game that i thought we were better than them
6500246 por cierto que los austriacos hab an sido derrotados 4 2 por per en cuartos de final

6500259 frivolous shopping is off the agenda as most customers concentrate on value and durability and there are few signs the slowdown has yet bottomed out
6500260 i hear that many of the stolen urns had ashes of women
6500261 we are investigating the cases but dont have a clue yet on who did it and for what purpose
6500262 many people found out that the ashes were stolen when cleaning graves

6500270 a raptor is any bird with talons used to capture food and defend themselves with the addition of a sharp hooked beak
6500271 hopefully if our building fund comes through and we have our site plan approval by the county we will have a new bird facility
6500272 we arent even concerned with having offices for the staff at first we just want the birds to have a home
6500273 we have had great response here at boyne highlands this summer and we are hoping this carries on into the fall and winter season
6500274 the red tailed hawk is the most common hawk in michigan youll see them often hanging out on fence and light posts hunting for prey
6500275 if you find an injured bird you can call northwings and we will help you place the bird in a safe environment where it can be cared for
6500276 the amount of strength these birds possess at full capacity is phenomenal
6500277 just one of the golden eagles talons has the strength equal to four adult mens fists when crunching its prey or tearing its meat
6500278 these birds really are an integral part of our wildlife and a terrific thing to see firsthand
6500279 you can tell her that youve been to a different rodeo and dont you know what with me sister
6500280 its possible the fire could have been caused by transients but we dont know that for sure
6500281 we hope the owners of the property will monitor the movement around the property and make sure the house is boarded up and checked periodically to see if there is someone inside
6500282 some of the very large boats are so bad if you are sitting on your balcony or patio and they go by on the other side of the lake youll have to stop your conversation because you cant hear its that loud
6500283 its an issue for a huge number of people the website basically says we are asking the fine be drastically increased and at a second offence the boat be impounded and not allowed back in the water until the exhaust is permanently fixed
6500284 as i understand it it only adds about a 5 increase so if people werent allowed to do it it isnt going to have any appreciable effect on the enjoyment of the boat
6500285 the fine is just 115 a lot of those boats spend that much on gas in an hour so its not a significant fine as far they are concerned the rcmp do their best but they dont have the resources to enforce properly
6500286 we also have to realize that these things have been sitting in the water for the past 50 years so its not like were introducing them to a foreign body
6500287 the prime concern would appear to be a little bit of turbidity as they land on the bottom of the lake i suspect that we do far more damage to okanagan lake with our milfoil program than will be done by these pontoons
6500288 his injuries were the result of a lightning strike that hit the ground and travelled to where the worker was standing he was taken to kgh
6500289 i want to encourage people in this community who may not normally think that they have the time to run for council to reconsider
6500290 i think its important that we have people from all walks of life and that includes people who have businesses who are busy and think they are too busy for council we have people sitting at this table who have jobs who run multiple businesses and still have time to make a contribution to their community
6500291 my greatest concern is we have a good representation of our community and not just people who are looking for jobs if you need a job and you cant find one then this isnt what you should be doing
6500292 anybody running for council has to understand that youre an independent person and you stand up and make all kinds of promises and criticisms of the current council and how much better you would do let me tell you its not as easy as you think it is
6500293 ive listened especially in the last week to a lot of innuendo about this council a lot of mean spirited nasty things have been said in the last week and it bothers me because there isnt one person sitting around this council table that is mean spirited that doesnt care deeply about this community and doesnt think long and hard about the decision that get made
6500294 to the people that ive served with here for three years and we sure dont always agree i have enjoyed working with each and every one of you and disagreeing with each and every one of you
6500295 the laurel packinghouse is an important asset for this city but it is now showing its age
6500296 we are taking the necessary steps to understand exactly which repairs are needed so that the building can be enjoyed for many years to come
6500297 in addition the mechanical electrical and sprinkler systems are nearing the end of their service life the building also needs upgrades to meet current codes for accessibility
6500298 the building has stood for nearly a century and has been well used by the community since the second floor was added 25 years ago we encourage the public to continue to visit the museums
6500299 it causes drought the farmers have to go a long way to get water and without water they cant live
6500300 some people from vietnam and laos have been coming over the border and chopping the forest down for valuable natural oil
6500301 its maybe 90 foreigners who are responsible but weve already arrested five or six of them
6500302 but rubber is powerful we know its bad for the environment but we also know that now we have electricity and life is much easier

6500312 seg n hemos podido saber en la sexta de fuentes solventes los muertos superar an el centenar
6500313 las cat strofes con muchos muertos ofrecen un gran escenario para las miserias del periodismo el propio periodista suele ser consciente de ellas pero tiene que hacer su trabajo que en un primer momento consiste b sicamente en estorbar a veces los equipos de rescate y los servicios m dicos se muestran asqueados por la avidez de los buitres de la prensa es cierto el reportero ejerce de bestia carro era el servicio p blico es as se ores y ustedes quieren informaci n inmediata el derecho de los familiares a la intimidad no hay derecho que valga
6500314 el destino nos entreg una de esas loter as en forma de tragedias que aguardan camufladas en un pliegue de la normalidad de una tarde de verano las cadenas hicieron un gran despliegue hasta convertir la tarde en una de esas jornadas en las que la informaci n y el directo valen su peso en oro poco a poco los espectadores fuimos volviendo despacio a la rutina de nuestras vacaciones o al estr s del trabajo el escalofr o pegado al cuerpo pensando en esas personas a las que el destino ni siquiera les dio la miserable oportunidad de verle la cara al m dico de urgencias

6500316 la protagonista es tina fey inteligente humorista que basa todo su mordacidad en el texto y no en el gesto ella es la jefa del programa una mujer que a fuerza de lidiar con guionistas friquis y actores descontrolados se ha convertido en una aut ntica ahuyentadora de hombres y que mantiene una relaci n de amor odio con su jefe baldwin la fant stica galer a de personajes como el botones al que le gusta dejarse humillar o la estrella televisiva impredecible la convierte en toda una joya del humor disparatado

6500328 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6500329 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6500330 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along

6500359 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
6500360 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
6500361 atheist leaders will not be tempted to think they are the messenger of any good news from above or the agent of any higher purpose on earth or at very least they will not think this literally
6500362 in the past radical clerics featured but their influence has moved into the background
6500363 suicide bombing is not just a religious phenomenon it is employed by many secular organisations including the kurdish pkk and the marxist tamil tigers
6500364 ariel merari a tel aviv university psychologist has profiled 50 suicide bombers and found that there were hardly any common factors none were deranged or schizophrenic few had problems like depression merari concluded that the only factor linking all forms of suicide terrorism was the way bombers were recruited and trained it is the psychology of the group not the individual that is key
6500365 there are serious flaws in the nss and the approach it embodies but it is a document which offers all things to all readers while being strangely unable to provide much in the way of vision leadership and motivation or strategy in other words the nss refers to the uks core values human rights the rule of law legitimate and accountable government justice freedom tolerance and opportunity for all but these values are mentioned in a strangely passive and defensive way almost as if the most that should be done with these immense ideas is to protect them from marauding terrorists and criminals and of course to stop them being ruined by flood water saddest of all these values appear to constitute little more than the normality to which we are told the governments security strategy will enable us to return as soon as possible after some harm occurs
6500366 so far 200 projects in 70 towns and cities have been funded by whitehall in the attempt to develop the capacity of communities particularly involving muslim women to challenge and resist violent extremists

6500368 counter terrorism police disrupt 13 terror networks last year from april 2007 until march 2008 over 40 people were convicted of terrorist related offences as a result of metropolitan police investigations and sentences amounting to more than 600 years were imposed the police arrested 46 people in relation to terrorist investigations between the start of this year and may 31 and charged 10 although the report points out that some of the remainder have been cautioned detained pending an immigration investigation or dealt with under the mental health act
6500369 it is extremely difficult for the nationalist tradition to separate out what i might call peacetime britishness from unionist triumphalism just as many unionists find it difficult to separate irish patriotism from at least implied support for the ira i know this sounds piously balanced but i believe it to be the case
6500370 councillor robin newton the dup group leader said that on friday morning the strategic policy and resources committee will discuss the provision of hospitality for members of the armed forces following a homecoming parade to st annes cathedral
6500371 i hope that all committee members will be able to support the civic reception and that t hose who feel they are unable to vote for will at least not vote against the worst thing for the city will be if this issue becomes a political football with the resulting bad feeling that will be generated
6500372 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6500373 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6500374 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden
6500375 bombs threaten life and property as would more harmful devices not yet found in the possession of terrorists but that they might conceivably obtain
6500376 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
6500377 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6500378 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6500379 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
6500380 i was with a friend doing some sightseeing on the wettest day of the year and having set out for a stroll to get a better view of the rope bridge which was closed due to bad weather we came upon three men in a piece of exposed ground under a large cliff face so strange was the situation that im not sure if it was performance art or some patients on day release one man was sitting on a fold up stool he was bald quite old and wearing some manner of an upside down hat which contained a shoe mould as well as a childs shoe another large oldish character was wearing a high viz jacket and lying on the ground staring at a boules petanque ball he occasionally got up to throw it badly according to my friend the boules expert and follow after the ball before getting back down on the ground and resuming his staring meanwhile the third man who was younger than the rest produced a rusty bicycle wheel from a bag and began rolling it around the rough ground every so often he would squeeze an old fashioned low pitched car horn which sounded not unlike a duck quacker this was taking place at approximately 2 30pm on saturday afternoon my questions are there surrealists at large on the causeway coast and if so naturally is this art or is a local institution missing some of its in patients
6500381 an emergency meeting of the regional development committee was told independent consultants would examine what had happened
6500382 no doubt the culvert did its job it was designed and built exactly in accordance with specifications and put into practice
6500383 but unfortunately you cant countenance for severe weather conditions like this
6500384 it had been through the whole process of checking rivers agency were happy with it we were happy with it and the roads service were happy with the design we put forward or else nobody would have signed on it nobody anticipated the amount of rain we had and i dont think the finger pointing is going to help we just have to see how we are going to get over this problem and prevent it in the future
6500385 the decision to realign the clowney river to the south of the underpass rather than integrate it into the roof slab has been a major factor in allowing us to reprogramme the work to finish this part early this allowed us to deal more efficiently with numerous overhead and underground services and keep traffic running during the construction
6500386 california is home to some of the finest custom frame builders in the world

6500395 brother let me tell you you want a mosquito harvest by that i mean a mosquito breeds and multiples in a matter of seconds on the other hand there is an elephant harvest it takes an elephant two years to produce you are expecting a mosquito harvest but perhaps god has an elephant harvest in mind for you why personally ive got several elephant harvests due me in one case its been 7 years
6500396 you just have to trust in god and his wisdom keep the faith and if you dont well you aint gettin neither a mosquito or an elephant harvest

6500467 t here was another interview this is yesterday same day where somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective and by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6500468 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans

6500475 coming to a negotiated settlement has got to be the right thing to do for everyone concerned
6500476 we welcome the companys approach to achieving a negotiated settlement
6500477 the news is positive as mts is promoting 3g networks and this is a toy for advanced users who will become the main consumers of the services which the company is going to offer within these networks
6500478 we need to know on what conditions the companies have reached an agreement whether they are exclusive but it is not such a trigger for the company which will radically influence its results
6500479 the other night i was with a group of people and the fastest thing to do was to get on the bus some of these people had never been on a bus as if this was some awful low class way
6500480 people who wouldnt normally take the bus they can see this beautiful piece of art here and want to take public transportation
6500481 we as an industry need to repaint the picture and make it attractive
6500482 weve been linked with quite a few but we have shown an interest in bullard indeed in quite a few other players
6500483 its not particularly going brilliantly but were trying to get good players for the right price and that does take a little bit of time because people want to hang on to their players
6500484 what the government should do is place all securities under the sweeping powers of the same kind of agency that regulates drugs and just as drugs are tested for their real effects and approved with regulatory strings securities too should be subject to testing which would be in the nature of simulations and approved if found not to have malign side effects and found to be useful only with their own regulatory strings the shadow financial system as roubini calls it has become a giant ectoplasm of iffy puts and options in a system that really has already developed the vehicles it needs for investment thank you very much and as we have seen alien turns to the nanny state as soon as the downside whacks it thrust the fuckers into the light regulation now regulation forever
6500485 joseph stiglitz a professor of economics at columbia university who won the nobel in 2001 suggested misguided innovation itself caused the current turmoil
6500486 these are the problems financial markets should have created products to match but they created risks and now were bearing the consequences of this so called innovation
6500487 we have to learn how to handle the shocks when they occur
6500488 we may need a financial instrument administration that tests the robustness of financial instruments and approves only the uses where they can do no harm
6500489 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6500490 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6500491 while he is still here he is very much 100 a tottenham player that is how we consider things it is not a case of finding a solution to a problem before it occurs
6500492 weve got a list of targets that we are working very hard on
6500493 negotiations are tough and sometimes they are even tougher than usual we know what we are working towards and we know what our objectives are
6500494 the process of signing players sometimes takes time but fans should be aware we are trying to strengthen up front and sign a new forward quite often these things take time
6500495 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
6500496 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
6500497 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
6500498 i havent gotten any issues from them for a while hmmm maybe they closed down
6500499 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
6500500 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
6500501 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
6500502 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
6500503 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
6500504 cifra de afaceri a crescut in primul semestru cu 30 in lei si cu 18 20 in euro initial estimam un avans de 40 dar partea de distributie a scazut foarte mult daca anul trecut vanzarile en gros au reprezentat 15 din afaceri acum am ajuns la 5 deoarece vanzarile erau orientate in special catre comerciantii independenti care au inceput sa dispara
6500505 veniturile din distributie s au majorat in primul semestru cu 75 fata de primele sase luni din 2007 iar retailul a crescut cu 43 distributia a reprezentat 35 40 ca pondere in afacerile grupului in s1
6500506 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6500507 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6500508 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6500509 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6500510 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
6500511 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
6500512 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
6500513 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6500514 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6500515 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6500516 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6500517 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6500518 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6500519 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
6500520 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6500521 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6500522 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6500523 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6500524 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6500525 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6500535 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6500536 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6500537 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas

6500550 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6500551 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6500552 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6500553 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6500554 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6500555 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6500556 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6500557 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6500558 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6500559 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6500560 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6500561 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6500562 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6500563 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6500564 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6500565 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6500566 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6500567 things should be made as simple as possible but no simpler

6500574 as someone who knows his way around a farm i know farming is hard work and getting harder because of the cost of fuel
6500575 while this is only a partial solution to our energy challenges opening these areas will immediately lead to reductions in crude oil prices once the industry knows they will one day be able to add these vast resources to our energy inventory
6500576 we continue to look for ways to streamline and become more efficient

6500580 mike arcuri can use all the smoke and mirrors that one would expect from a career politician but the bottom line is his refusal to support new drilling is affecting the pocketbooks of working families and family farms across
6500581 makes false assertions and presents an image of mr powers inconsistent with the truth we have been reading in recent news coverage
6500582 mr powers is currently unemployed and claimed less than 700 in income between may 2007 through may 2008
6500583 mr powers is presenting an image of himself that exaggerates his status in the workplace
6500584 first jon powers came under fire for exaggerating the truth and now hes trying to hide from it
6500585 if jon powers is so proud of his work with the foundation he was paid to run then why is he refusing to talk about it now

6500593 the candidate republicans should be clamoring for is the one liberals are most feverishly denouncing that is mitt romney by a landslide
6500594 he just tripped off a chair he was getting ready to speak somebody aimed a gun at him and him he dove for the floor
6500595 prominent evangelical leaders are warning sen john mccain against picking former massachusetts gov mitt romney as his running mate saying their troops will abandon the republican ticket on election day if that happens
6500596 they say mr romney lacks trust on issues such as outlawing abortion and opposing same sex marriage and because he is a mormon opposition is particularly powerful among those who supported former arkansas gov mike huckabee in the republican presidential primaries earlier this year
6500597 other well placed christian conservatives say that although many evangelical leaders could accept and work for a mccain romney ticket mr huckabees supporters tend to be rabid in their views against mr romney because of his faith they do not regard mormonism as a christian denomination
6500598 i am wholeheartedly convinced that mitt romney can be trusted to uphold the values and principles most important to me as a political conservative and an evangelical christian again i am not being paid and i am not interested in a job in a romney administration i would not accept one even if offered as im still raising three teenagers neither is my public relations firm involved in any way i am involved because i believe the stakes are high perhaps higher than ever before in my life

6500601 how many middle class americans spend 80 000 leasing cars over an eight year period
6500602 i can assure you lou barletta will not be leasing luxury suvs nor will he be charging taxpayers to have xm satellite radio in his car

6500604 prices have climbed on renewed geopolitical tensions between the us and russia with the latter voicing its displeasure over a us poland defence pact whereby the us can station defence shield missiles in poland much to russias dislike
6500605 crude futures were higher on thursday extending gains from yesterday on weakness in the dollar and persistent geopolitical fears
6500606 the latest diplomatic stand off with russia over georgia has once again reminded investors of the markets sensitivity to all kinds of geopolitical risks
6500607 these also include persistent tensions in the middle east and violence in nigeria

6500619 it would be great if the country said lets throw the bums out and i didnt have to campaign
6500620 due to the unprecedented demand our inventories have been depleted
6500621 we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins
6500622 this whole thing started about the time the ruskies made their move
6500623 it may very well be that the usgovt is preparing for the real financial meltdown by hoarding all remaining gold flows
6500624 we are working diligently to build up our inventory and hope to resume sales shortly
6500625 if i dont have something to sell i lose business
6500626 the situation is strange and doesnt fit the normal supply amp demand economic model
6500627 we link up with them and do joint patrols and give them some instruction get them used to working with locals and get people used to seeing them down here
6500628 the biggest thing here is getting out with the anbp letting the people see them get them trusting and working with the anbp if we are guests in the area and they only see us it doesnt quite seem like we are guests if we are accompanied by anbp we are perceived more as guests and partnering with them helps establish the government out here
6500629 im tasked with supervising the training of the anbp and what ive done is come up with a campaign plan on what i want them to learn and on what i want the marines to focus on until we are out of here
6500630 they are all willing to work ive built a special relationship with the platoon sergeant for this group of guys his name is nassar ahmad and his guys want to work they are real proud of what they do
6500631 especially patrols while driving and while hiking we learned we need to train more because the marines have techniques for patrols we hope to learn we like it
6500632 i enjoy being able to work with the marines its a good chance to work together and bring peace and security to afghanistan and its people they the insurgents are a big problem for us the border patrol and marines
6500633 the first day we started the job we had problems like we needed weapons supplies clothes boots and these things the marines and coalition forces help us they give us what they can
6500634 every time they come out they improve so the only challenge i have is me not being able to tell that platoon sergeant of that police officer what i want done i have to do it through a linguist
6500635 on yesterdays patrol i was watching some of the police officers take their own initiative to stop vehicles and turn them around like we briefed before we stepped off the things we are briefing are sticking and they are learning that is one of my goals that i wanted to hit
6500636 we are trying to get them into intelligence gathering from the local people and information operations sending messages out because they dont get a lot of news from the rest of the country so we are trying to get them to pass out news we also want them more involved with civil military operations like handing out chow clothing for children and school supplies
6500637 we were kind of overwhelmed by how much they didnt know then we got another group and these guys have been nothing but good things for us
6500638 from what ive seen and from what ive heard the locals are happy the trust hasnt always been there with the anbp and we are building it slowly the locals are happy to see these guys it puts an afghanistan face to what is being accomplished down here
6500639 people are coming up to talk to us telling us there is enemy activity in the area before they were afraid to tell us for fear of the insurgents coming in at night the night letters they are telling us these things because they know were out there and that the marines and anbp care enough to provide security for them
6500640 to serve my people and to protect my land and my people
6500641 people are happy when they see us together and they know that its a sign of afghanistan that we have the coalition forces like the marines to keep the area safe they like the idea of us working together
6500642 they are very similar in that they want their country to be safe they want to control the area they want to work down here and they are very excited to be able to come down and patrol with us i think having those guys just like in iraq was essential to controlling the area as long as we get those guys working with us and the more of them we get the quicker we can work ourselves out of a job
6500643 they speak the same language and once we leave the area they will be the ones controlling it so the more we can get those guys out with us the more influence they will have the more trust is built and the more the government is established down here
6500644 we wont always be in this country eventually we will be leaving the afghanistan national police and anbp will be here all we want to do is leave that lasting impression
6500645 it would be great if the country said lets throw the bums out and i didnt have to campaign
6500646 it would be great if the country said lets throw the bums out and i didnt have to campaign

6500649 the viva la vida sessions were incredibly fruitful they gelled brilliantly with producer brian eno and recorded much more music than they could fit on one album
6500650 the majority of the follow up is already in the can though they will have to go back into the studio at some point to add a few more songs
6500651 it will be on a record we will put out in 2009 some time next year the album will neatly wrap up things for the end of the decade then i dont know what well do
6500652 i never met britney spears i cant have animosity with someone i dont know
6500653 there was a recognition in the primaries that we spent a little too much time doing the big rallies
6500654 people think obamas fame or the fact they know him from a speech or a book is his totality and its not
6500655 cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them
6500656 theres still a mystery element to this guy and the opposition so far has done a good job of defining him
6500657 the partys candidates tend to have an intellectual way of expressing their views
6500658 that gets portrayed as effete and elitist people like simplicity
6500659 theres a little bit of kerry in obama in that he seems aloof and not as engaged as mccain
6500660 you cant come out and say im uncomfortable with a black man as president but its entirely possible that theres a segment of the population that feels that way
6500661 is code for the n word if hes a white guy no ones saying hes elitist hes doing what everybody else is doing
6500662 hes just not my kind of candidate certainly some of it is inexperience but some is attitude
6500663 i get a pompous vibe from him and i dont like that
6500664 i dont know that he can it may be part and parcel of him
6500665 obama needs to offer as many specifics as possible talk about home foreclosures for instance or health care
6500666 one of our biggest battle tools is that barack obama and john mccain have completely different approaches to energy the economy foreign policy
6500667 obama needs to show how hes something different and mccain is more of the same
6500668 i want new ideas i want to hear about a new way of doing business

6500682 with a guy he can connect with dads in a different kind of way
6500683 it feels different to have a guy come in to work with your kids
6500684 a woman has a womans touch and people are more accepting and ready for her advice we had to find the right person who has real authority and a gentle touch as well
6500685 i read this story as a kid and it really stayed with me
6500686 postproduction and distribution of films has become more complex especially as releasing films simultaneously around the world has become more popular
6500687 a films domestic version can change throughout the postproduction process typically very close to its release date leaving little time to make the necessary changes on the international versions
6500688 the opening date of the film was shifted around like the planchette on a ouija board a sure sign that the studio knew it had one of those hollywood we have a problem movies that needed to arrive in theaters in a relatively quiet part of the summer season
6500689 rainn wilson is off his rocker to take this role
6500690 the rocker is a grubby little redemption comedy that in every way feels like a consignment shop jack black vehicle
6500691 its a lot of fun its spirit is genuine and even with the odd vomit gag fundamentally sweet
6500692 at some point i dont know when she should have a show shes on the short list its a very short list shes at the top
6500693 a program hosted by ms maddow will almost certainly be a closer ideological fit with keith olbermanns
6500694 we would never put an event on tape delay when we put live on the screen we mean live right now we dont mean live three hours ago
6500695 its very difficult to date i just got kind of lucky
6500696 hes just a great guy hes awesome and really really talented
6500697 our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever
6500698 everyone knows i love l a but london watch out im coming to town and bringing my fast paced life with me

6500706 its a real blow to the people that loved him
6500707 im just shocked the real effect of not having him around is going to just hit us more and more both personally and professionally
6500708 i cant think of a thing that i did that i loved that paul wasnt a part of its a horrible shock to me he was such a warm
6500709 in recent weeks ricky martin became a proud father by the birth of twin sons
6500710 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care

6500716 shes a cool girl and shes better than she was because at one point she was in a bad way
6500717 i wish her all the best with whatever she does and if shes with a girl then good for her in this day and age its all good
6500718 they couldnt believe how amazing the food tasted patrick dempsey enjoyed the chocolate vegan cake and ellen pompeo has gone to truly vegan half a dozen times since trying the food
6500719 we go back and forth i dont know if its in our immediate future its something we talk about every few months well know when the time is right if were going to do it
6500720 if they would be as pretty as brad and angelinas kids we might
6500721 brad has changed my sister a lot they have an extraordinary bond ive never seen any sign of tension between them and if it keeps going the way its going theyll be together for life

6500730 im starting to feel more relaxed about acting in english now but it takes time and i have to work very hard on it
6500731 when im not performing in spanish i feel extra tension its like torture sometimes trying to get rid of my accent
6500732 i quite enjoy it actually im never followed but cate is her public identity is very associated with her work which i think is good right and proper because shes bloody good at it
6500733 when her work is coming into focus people want to see a photo of her carrying shopping bags i can understand it people are interested and im glad theyre interested otherwise they wouldnt come to see it her movies
6500734 i may do it in the future but i dont think im going to do it right now
6500735 if i changed my name to hers then telepicture degeneres productions company would have to change a lot of signs
6500736 when the time comes im going to nip it and tuck it all
6500737 winona didnt waste any time she and tom were all over each other laughing and carrying on
6500738 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films
6500739 hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property i was rather excited at this news
6500740 he said do you know how much of a percentage hed want its always been policy that no bond director ever got a slice of the box office profits
6500741 so spielberg went off and made indiana jones who i reckon to be a period james bond
6500742 i have been a dolly fan all of my life she s a wonderful woman i really connect with her music i can t think of a better role model for my children
6500743 she has this great sweet personality but she s also strong and wise
6500744 mr robinson really appreciates and takes seriously the opportunity which has been given to him by the court and the prosecution to have all of the charges against him dismissed upon successful completion of a counselling programme
6500745 there are always some crazy things i get flashed quite often luckily mostly from girls
6500746 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6500747 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6500748 i kissed anna nicole she came to my rocker chick show she was wearing one of those dotted net see through things with roses on her bullet bra underneath it was when she was doing dietary supplement trimspa and she looked really beautiful
6500749 its news to me it wouldnt surprise me if they wanted him but they would have plenty of hoops to jump through
6500750 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6500751 its fatal when actresses use botox i remember seeing cold mountain and it really looked to me like nicole kidman had been using it
6500752 her face was neither sad nor glad nor anything she was just like a painted doll
6500753 cusack grew up in a massive house on sheridan road
6500754 its slightly disingenuous to say he had to scrape together 2 50 im thinking that wasnt an issue
6500755 she consumes a cocktail of prescription painkillers ambien sleeping pills and rum or vodka each night and during the day
6500756 she is in no condition to drive in the morning i have seen her be drowsy and dizzy with difficulties in co ordination i have warned on numerous occasions to refrain from transporting our children in the car when she is in such a state
6500757 it is ludicrous for her to claim that she is afraid of me i am not a violent or aggressive person
6500758 russell admires hicks and is very keen to be involved in the project
6500759 comedy has never been seen as russells strong point so this is an opportunity to change the publics perception of him
6500760 like hicks russell is very passionate and forthright with his views and isnt afraid to upset people if he thinks hes in the right this could be an ideal role for him
6500761 now go back to making your movies about women who love to handle big guns that shoot hundreds of people to death
6500762 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse at the hands of her own parents
6500763 roseannes parents responded to the accusation by going on the air and slating she is a psychopathic liar and her sister agreed
6500764 paul starr has this uncanny ability to look at a face and see what it needs hes done my face a thousand times and never repeated a look i have never felt more like the best version of myself than when paul has made me up
6500765 during the time we have spent in the make up chair we talked about everything but the photo shoot global issues babies human rights
6500766 i was getting breakfast and thought ah i just dont want to talk to her today so i bumped it then two seconds later there was a message from nicole wishing us good luck
6500767 i ended up returning her call she was very happy
6500768 she was very surprised that we do have a tradition of naming our boats after her movies and shes just really stoked to be part of a team
6500769 i love and adore being a mother my children are the greatest gift ive ever been given
6500770 its very difficult to be a career person and have a relationship i didnt succeed at doing it at all its incredibly hard
6500771 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
6500772 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
6500773 being in the industry for over twenty years ive realised that my true fan base have kids just like me
6500774 and i needed to make a connection to the next generation and hopefully keep some continuity in these households and sustain my career
6500775 at some point every artist has to reach to the next generation and let them know what youre all about this was the easiest way to do that
6500776 they were kind enough to give me a few of the playboy bunny necklace that i wear in the film i mean they re not that expensive but it means a lot
6500777 he was like a surfing jim morrison he lived in the fast lane but had an incredibly dark side to his character id really like to explore that
6500778 i mean he was the stepson of clark gable and he inherited a vast fortune as the heir to the spreckels sugar millions but there was this other side to him
6500779 theres this great documentary about his short life called bunker 77 he was a fascinating guy
6500780 sometimes i get sad because sometimes im out of town a lot brian works but hes always in town and i have to travel a lot and sometimes thats hard because itll be weeks and weeks without seeing cash kassius and thats sad
6500781 luckily hes used to it because both of his parents are in the business so hes used to always being in transit and its not so hard on him but i feel guilty a lot
6500782 i was raised in the south and my mom was a strict disciplinarian its really easy for me to lay out the rules and make sure that the rules are followed constantly but i think because hes from a home with divorced parents its hard for brian to punish him kassius
6500783 he feels bad that cash has to always go through the transition in switching homes
6500784 i want a half a dozen what do you expect from me i want 12 kids
6500785 thats how the whole damn thing started you work with those babies too long and then i said it is
6500786 its just water and raw apple cider vinegar and it just cleans out your system entirely
6500787 it will get rid of for women who retain water weight from your menstrual cycle and all that it gets rid of it really fast sic
6500788 im not one for dieting or exercising cause im lazy and i have a really big sweet tooth so i have to do cleanses every once in a while cause of the amount of sugar i take in
6500789 my grandfather knows everything about music and would be happy to come to class
6500790 the program and books not only help the children learn music and composer lives but geography and other school interests some schools have music programs but nothing to follow up their music learning your books do the job
6500791 i identify and parse six housing bills with which obama was closely involved a few examples
6500792 provide d for funding for housing construction and rehabilitation and supportive services
6500793 as long as theres a market and the people who buy this stuff dont ask questions this is going to be a problem
6500794 quoi bon ajouter nos mots ceux souvent meilleurs des autres

6500797 these findings provide further evidence that the health system is falling short of where it needs to be to ensure health and economic security we need a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance available
6500798 whats happened number one young people liberals a solid core of obamas base just raising some questions about him for liberals maybe the perception that hes flip flopped on some key issues like fisa and a sense that for young people i think especially that maybe hes not the unique different sort of political persona that they expected
6500799 it was one of washingtons biggest scandals and the republican power broker ralph reed was in the middle of it in deep with convicted felon and lobbyist jack abramoff but when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify that senator john mccain and who is now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed for twenty six years in washington john mccain has played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same
6500800 if we dont reenact the draft i dont think well have anyone to chase bin laden to the gates of hell
6500801 maam let me say that i dont disagree with anything you said
6500802 one this is the best military weve ever had and its just not big enough two there has never been a draft that i have ever heard of since world war ii that was fair what weve done is we find rich people find a way out and lower income people are the ones that serve so the thing if you could design i might consider it i dont think its necessary i might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve
6500803 i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6500804 we are aware of the media reports and therefore we have to look into it
6500805 im duty bound to follow the law and apply to the law to the facts as i find them and it is on behalf of those millions of americans who believe in and value our democratic process and the right to vote that i put forth this objection today if they are willing to stand at polls for countless hours in the rain as many did in ohio then i should surely stand up for them here in the halls of congress this objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning the victory of the president but it is a necessary timely and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy i raise this objection neither to put the nation in the turmoil of a proposed overturned election nor to provide cannon fodder or partisan demagoguery for my fellow members of congress i raise this objection because i am convinced that we as a body must conduct a formal and legitimate debate about election irregularities i raise this objection to debate the process and protect the integrity of the true will of the people
6500806 over 675 fleets worldwide depend on our ability to provide location alarm and cargo information david sward general manager of transcore
6500807 throughout the course of a year our north american network manages approximately 315 000 customer inquiries per day translating to more than 115 million per year system availability is essential for smooth operations
6500808 even during rare brief interruptions all messages were stored and all transactions saved not only attaining but sustaining the elusive
6500809 we continue to set higher standards for network reliability and dependability
6500810 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6500811 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6500812 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6500813 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6500814 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6500815 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6500816 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6500817 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6500818 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6500819 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6500820 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6500821 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6500822 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6500823 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6500824 its the one form of music that was consistently in my world from the beginning
6500825 i still sing those songs i dont think i could separate what i do from that type of music even on this record even though its plugged in and has certain rock influences on some songs lyrically and in terms of what i try to do musically theres no separating me from that i still aim with my music for the response that those church songs evoked in my family and myself and the people around me
6500826 people seem to have a hard time defining what i do
6500827 when i first started people called it folk music and others called it bluegrass ive heard country and now im hearing rock with this record its all of those influences involved in what ive become it seems like a natural thing
6500828 i left the church and dropped out of school when i was seventeen but i didnt pursue it i had other jobs and did non musical things id come home at night and play the piano singing for myself
6500829 i suddenly realized that i had become pretty unhappy and that i wasnt enjoying any of these other things that i was trying to do
6500830 i made a conscious decision to stop running from the thing that i loved and just do it even if nobody liked it even if it got me nowhere even if everybody laughed at my songs i was going to write them and i was going to go out to sing them
6500831 that class did a lot to stimulate me creatively and had a lot to do with why i went into writing songs
6500832 the teacher was really good she didnt dwell on your structure or your misspellings even though she would point that out but if you had a good creative idea she would get really excited she seemed to truly enjoy that when a student would find things i thrived on that
6500833 i sat down one day and decided that i wanted to write a song
6500834 i decided to stop worrying about everybody else and what they would think about it and write for me after one you write songs forever for some reason that day i managed to get a verse and chorus and another verse it was just amazing for somebody who could never write more than one line i was in heaven i just kept going from there
6500835 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6500836 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6500837 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6500838 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6500839 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6500840 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6500841 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6500842 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6500843 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6500844 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6500845 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6500846 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6500847 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6500848 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6500849 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6500850 the big barrier to entry is how much time and money it can cost to create effective video ads
6500851 big companies have marketing staffs and ad agencies and big budgets so our mission when we got into this business was to bring a complete ad service to the smaller guys so they dont get left out
6500852 creating your ad is free so you can make two or 20 its up to you
6500853 for some local businesses its important to geo target and pick a particular state city or county for instance
6500854 we use contextual targeting so you could also define an age group or say youre interested in people who are interested in travel once thats specified our technology takes that information and serves your ad on our network which has over 40 million unique visitors we match your ad with an audience by using keywords tags and behavior profiles then we track how they do with real time reports
6500855 this feature is especially useful for small businesses who are more interested in closing the sale than building their brand they can create a coupon as a pdf or word file and when the ad is displaying theres a little bar at the bottom that will say click here for a special offer type thing and the viewer can print out the coupon or if its an online coupon get the coupon code
6500856 if you decide to run a campaign for five weeks but after the first week you want to pause it and change the ad you can because theres no charge for creating a new ad then you can continue and say launch three different ads to see which one does best and continue tweaking it
6500857 this is critical for small businesses who cant afford to pay 5 000 for a campaign just to find out it isnt working with jivox they can incrementally test the campaign and adjust it as they go
6500858 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6500859 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6500860 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6500861 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6500862 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6500863 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6500864 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6500865 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6500866 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6500867 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6500868 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6500869 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6500870 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6500871 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6500872 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6500873 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6500874 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6500875 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6500876 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6500877 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6500878 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6500879 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6500880 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6500881 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6500882 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6500883 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6500884 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6500885 its just a chance for everyone to get together and get to know each other a little better
6500886 i suppose if it had been a little hotter the players wouldve eaten a little more
6500887 we also had a few student athletes who had prior commitments and activities scheduled but it was still a very good turnout
6500888 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6500889 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6500890 i love malaysia and sepang so when the opportunity to race there came up again it was hard to resist touring cars and endurance racing are a bit of a change for me but im really looking forward to the challenge
6500891 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6500892 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6500893 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6500894 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6500895 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6500896 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6500897 ya sabemos la manera como fueron impuestas estas leyes son ideologizantes controladoras y centralistas y ya vimos c mo se ha empezado a actuar en base a ellas
6500898 cortadas con la misma tijera con la que se construy la reforma
6500899 por qu eliminar al plan rep blica del proceso y poner al brazo armado del psuv a cuidar los votos
6500900 esos candidatos vienen de ser funcionarios y ministros no son l deres comunitarios lo nico que les falta es incluir la reelecci n indefinida en las leyes
6500901 we take great pride in being ryders top international provider receiving this award five times in six years is truly a tribute to our people and their dedication to providing the highest level of service to our customers
6500902 ryder is proud to recognize its top performing carriers of 2007 who provide outstanding service and share our commitment to helping our customers operate more efficiently
6500903 we reached out for crime scene people and any other resources that are out there
6500904 and we have looked at several ways to jump start this
6500905 we recognize the family is in pain its been a year and there are no answers
6500906 freeman wallace was murdered the night jimmy carter was elected president
6500907 based on our review it appears robbery was a motive since the money wasnt found
6500908 i have reason to believe the killing was done where the body was found
6500909 there was a considerable amount of blood near the body the victim was about 63
6500910 there were suspects we brought in four people that night but we could never put it together
6500911 we never had a good enough case to charge any of them
6500912 that one i believe could be picked up and solved
6500913 she was last seen leaving her house at the corner of raymond street and capitol street
6500914 the case was just not worked very good we had no probable cause to arrest him for the death of that girl
6500915 there was no crime search actually made out there we got into it at a late date it was a cold trail a bunch of bones a bunch of rags out there
6500916 the known peptides were recognised by their points of elution and by chromatography with peak augmentation using commercially bought synthetic peptides it is of course conceivable that a chromatographically similar peptide may have appeared and run with the known peaks however it is reasonable to think that these peaks are caseomorphin 1 8 like peptides
6500917 the vehicle failed shortly after liftoff and in no way reached its intended position
6500918 the failed launch shows that the purported iranian space program is in its nascent stages at best they have a long way to go
6500919 well he was on his way over to my house the other day and when he arrived outside the house he didnt brake properly and boom he hit the curb the car flipped over and he crashed through the sunroof went flying through the air and smashed through my upstairs bedroom window
6500920 no no he survived that that didnt kill him at all so hes landed in my upstairs bedroom and hes all covered in broken glass on the floor then he spots the big old antique wardrobe we have in the room and reaches up for the handle to try to pull himself up hes just dragging himself up when bang this massive wardrobe comes crashing down on top of him crushing him and breaking most of his bones
6500921 no no that didnt kill him he survived that he managed to get the wardrobe off him and crawls out onto the landing he tries to pull himself up on the banister but under his weight the banister breaks and he goes falling down on to the first floor in mid air all the broken banister poles spin and fall on him pinning him to the floor sticking right through him
6500922 no no that didnt kill him he even survived that so hes on the downstairs landing just beside the kitchen he crawls in to the kitchen tries to pull himself up on the stove but reached for a big pot of boiling hot water whoosh the whole thing came down on him and burned most of his skin off him
6500923 no no he survived that he survived that hes lying on the ground covered in boiling water and he spots the phone and tries to pull himself up to call for help but instead he grabs the light switch and pulls the whole thing off the wall and the water and electricity didnt mix and so he got electrocuted wallop 10 000 volts shot through him
6500924 hold on now just how the hell did he die
6500925 you shot him what the hell did you shoot him for
6500926 players are refusing to play until they get reimbursed for their bus tickets
6500927 my god this is the national sport were talking about here
6500928 liberals we need to get back to power as soon as possible
6500929 a healthy collection of companies old and new small and large public and private put the greater twin cities near the top in many categories in the study which measured the concentration of businesses in the nations 50 most populous markets as well as the job picture in each city minneapolis st paul proved resilient in keeping its jobless rate low in a check of unemployment statistics
6500930 the twin cities region has a high concentration of massive and diverse fortune 1000 and s amp p 500 companies
6500931 der kosovo ist ein sonderfall und wir haben immer unterstrichen dass es keinen pr zedenzfall darstellen kann
6500932 frankreich unterst tzt die unabh ngigkeit souver nit t und territoriale integrit t georgiens in seinen international anerkannten grenzen
6500933 haben plan b falls verkauf der aua doch nicht klappt
6500934 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6500935 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6500936 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6500937 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6500938 my dream has always been to enter the movie theater with a first class high quality movie that is grippingly interesting but also is true to the biblical storyline and that was diluted in the first attempt
6500939 but lord willing we are going to see this thing made into the movie that it should be
6500940 its a golden opportunity for the christian community to come up with a stellar performance that will have millions of people come to it
6500941 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6500942 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6500943 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6500944 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6500945 i bought 1 000 tickets to the show i still have them
6500946 i want somebody who shares with me a passion to make the lives of the american people better than they are right now
6500947 i want somebody who is mad right now that people are losing their jobs
6500948 i think ill have my staff get back to you its condominiums where ill have them get to you
6500949 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6500950 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6500951 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6500952 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6500953 your indication that youre willing to put a person who has a clear unequivocal pro abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming
6500954 senator mccain you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick you wear it as a badge of honor well poke the base of the republican party the conservatives in the eye one more time by choosing a pro abortion vice presidential candidate and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game
6500955 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats the best that i can tell you
6500956 can nominate or try and nominate anyone he wants he is in fact the leader of the party now going forward but it would be a very bumpy road
6500957 main criteria would be a person that would allow us to sleep at night knowing that we had selected someone that could immediately be president of the united states
6500958 he will select the person that is best and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6500959 the nato airstrikes that were supposed to allow the soldiers under assault to get out of the trap according to the wounded missed their target and hit french soldiers along with other shots fired from afghan soldiers positioned below
6500960 were the victims of an extremely well prepared and murderous ambush we should not look here and there for other causes
6500961 the planes supplying close air support could not engage because french troops were very close to taliban insurgents and if they had engaged there may have been considerable collateral damage if the bombs had been used
6500962 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or injured were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6500963 they supposedly fixed the problem which the pilot later said was with the air conditioning and then we took off
6500964 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6500965 i took a child into the truck and he thought he was in a film but he asked when will this film end and where is my dad he asked if it was real if he was in a film but he wanted the film to end
6500966 they were promised the future of mobile phones but many owners of apples iphone 3g say the only future they have seen since its july 11th debut is a series of problems and software updates
6500967 it basically does everything i want it to do except for sometimes it doesnt it will open up give me a title page or splash card for a couple of seconds and then itll just go back to the home screen
6500968 were here in the heart of the financial district and i dont even have 3g connectivity so its kind of a bummer
6500969 its frozen quite a few times and ive only had it for two weeks its a little bit annoying
6500970 which could mean the headaches for some iphone 3g users arent going away anytime soon
6500971 its just kind of crapping out all the time before the update on monday it wasnt really getting calls very well it was dropping calls all the time then i updated on monday and now the calls function works fine but im having a lot of problems with the application and the internet browsing function so its really wonky these days its not very dependable
6500972 we have to remember that when 3g was launched in europe a couple of years ago they had very similar problems so we shouldnt blame this only on apple its a brand new network its a brand new technology gonna have a bunch of 3g phones really soon theyre rolling out their 3g network so were gonna see problems with this across the board because 3gs very new to us
6500973 thats my deadline if its not working by halloween im gonna go back to my blackberry but i think we should have some patience either that or maybe ill just write the word sucker across my forehead because i have faith in the iphone
6500974 some of the last generation nanos have been overheating and giving their owners minor burns so its not just spontaneous combustion where its going to light on fire and your hair catches on fire something like that but it will overheat from time to time and then you get some burns but this is the last generation nano the one they sold about two years ago the current generation of nanos hasnt had any problems reported
6500975 all gadgets are prone to overheating like that computers laptops things like that we should expect that pretty much all gadgets may overheat
6500976 there are things you can do you can run your battery for the full lifecycle of your gadgets battery life and never ever ever buy a counterfeit battery ever because those are prone to explode
6500977 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6500978 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6500979 why did the browns fall short of the playoffs last season
6500980 if we have a chance to improve ourselves well look at that
6500981 many people told me that somalia is not safe and does not have a government
6500982 to halt international military co operation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions

6501000 do you still count of course youre diabetic youre fat i hate it every doctor since i was in highschool when i was a whole 56
6501001 it has been confirmed that gail kim is indeed through with tna
6501002 where are the opportunities to incorporate that into the picture
6501003 why what is it about that that makes it so fun so appealing
6501004 i dont have enough money i have too many financial obligations ive invested too much time into my current path im too inexperienced im too old
6501005 what do i need to know to make this happen
6501006 what kinds of people do i need to know to make this happen
6501007 how do i build reputation i need to make this happen
6501008 what factors need to be in place for me to successfully make a change
6501009 well i would love to do that right now but i cant
6501010 i was usually on the total opposite side of the field when something like that happens
6501011 i guess lucks just swinging my way a little bit i got two and hopefully those will keep coming my way
6501012 hes a little more comfortable and his athletic ability is coming out the things that we saw him do and the plays he made in college youre just waiting for him to relax and make those and he is showing it
6501013 when the game slows down and you feel like youre in the right place you can play aggressively thats whats happening for brannon as well
6501014 i have a wider vision i guess youd say instead of just being locked on my specific thing look around you see more specific stuff that helps you see different stuff and that helps you make more plays on different things i guess that goes with the territory
6501015 newer territory for me but i like it and i hope that doesnt stop
6501016 in college the last couple of years i was the guy on defense so i guess they tried to stay away from me a little bit too with passes
6501017 thats obviously different now hopefully they will pass my way a lot of more and give me a chance to make some plays
6501018 all three of them sanders bethea and giordano are awesome guys i like all of them and theyll help me out whenever i need it coming from college you want to play right way you come in and its tough because you know youre not going to start over them guys
6501019 i want to be out there playing and im not and it just kills me i guess its not my time right now so im just waiting whenever i do get in there i just have to show what i can do and see what happens from there
6501020 the last one i should be in there a lot
6501021 i want to continue to improve and keep getting better every game i feel every preseason game so far ive gotten a little better i just want to keep that up and keep improving and hopefully prove to the coaches i can get out there and do it so theyll put me in if necessary
6501022 i mess up on a few things still i just have to correct that once i get out there and do that ill be fine
6501023 i just have to keep that up and hopefully that will be my ticket right there its more trying to make plays than trying to be a big hitter
6501024 anybody can throw their body into somebody but if youre out there making plays you stand out a lot more

6501034 with the launch of the trade up incentive program in 2007 we were pleased although not surprised to learn that many mcintosh customers all over the country are proud owners of products that theyve been using and cherishing for many years the vast majority of these products still work just as well as the day they were purchased the fact is many mcintosh products not only withstand the test of time but also actually retain or even increase in value over the years last years trade up program allowed people to trade in their mcintosh amplifiers and this year were pleased to expand it to include a broader range of our luxury products
6501035 people who own mcintosh equipment understand and appreciate the unique attributes of their products in terms of performance overall build quality and enduring value not surprisingly this makes our customers extremely loyal to our brand by expanding our trade up program were not only rewarding our customers for their loyalty and support but were communicating and underscoring the unique lasting value that our products offer to discriminating home entertainment enthusiasts everywhere

6501042 hey i actually enjoyed playing doctor with you my sibling i turned out okay and so did you
6501043 i really enjoy having sex with you and i want you to move in but we will never get married because i dont see the point of signing away half of everything ill ever earn

6501046 you know youd never have had to go to rehab if you had never taken that first snort
6501047 you know science and history show it might help if you involved someone of the opposite sex
6501048 why are you even bothering to involve clergy if you took religion that seriously youd be marrying someone of the same faith
6501049 remember according to the judges marrying her is j ust like marrying a guy because her skin tone is different than yours
6501050 almost none of them had any money left so they were unable to leave georgia via other countries
6501051 working with her was definitely a dream of mine and when it came to actually doing it it was everything youd think it would be
6501052 it was great and it was bad and it was cool and it was tedious sometimes and it was fun and we went down into the valleys together and we came out on top of mountains
6501053 we had a really good time and im now very happy to be able to call her a friend shes a really really special person
6501054 im so proud of this record everybody played out of their skin

6501064 kristen and i ran into each other and we did discuss a
6501065 you have your first really good start in two years then your front four players go down
6501066 we had head injuries hand injuries bad ankles broken bones ripped muscles concussions here and there our leading scorer broke his foot in the first conference game id never seen anything like it
6501067 it was unfortunate but i was really proud of the way our team kept battling through it
6501068 they could have thought they were destined for failure and folded their tents but they didnt they wouldnt accept failure
6501069 with all the injuries they had theyd become very guard oriented at that point they really just shot the lights out against us theyll be very talented with most of those guys back and should be a team thatll be there every year they have resources that a lot of us dont have
6501070 this is the most optimistic ive ever been going into the season were more talented than weve been
6501071 you can have your ups and downs during the season
6501072 but when it comes to march though everythings on the table in march our players go into the league tournament knowing that northwestern state belongs there when youve been able to consistently win in march theyre going to expect to keep doing that
6501073 athletic shooter scorer hes been our leading rebounder last two years and gets in the passing lanes on defense if he can improve his ballhandling and passing hell be a hell of a pro he could seriously be making money somewhere as a two guard
6501074 sam houston state us uta and lamar were the best teams in the league last year
6501075 its good for cbc radio to be playing a variety of musical genres
6501076 but this is a radical change it is moving away from something only the public broadcaster can do to something many private broadcasters already do
6501077 the canadian public broadcaster has a responsibility to transmit world classical culture to new generations of canadians
6501078 they are substantially moving away from that responsibility they falsely assume that world classical culture is not something that can be marketed to appeal to younger audiences
6501079 the canadian broadcasting corporation as the national public broadcaster should provide radio and television services incorporating a wide range of programming that informs enlightens and entertains

6501086 terrorism and profiling shifting the focus from criteria to effects
6501087 it was kind of weird seeing the others get to keep playing
6501088 but we treated that like it was our championship game
6501089 redshirting an entire class took a lot of patience from our fans
6501090 and to everybodys credit nobody looked at it like a throwaway year surviving that season ending up with a bunch of men on the following years team instead of a mix and match really helped us through that transition thats the single biggest thing that we did that maybe wasnt done in some other places
6501091 there was one division i offer among those three guys
6501092 so they all came into this with the feeling they had something to prove nobody wanted them
6501093 we played a big ten caliber schedule every year thats the way they looked at it
6501094 when we went down to florida for my first game as a head coach last year i was more nervous than they were
6501095 i felt the same way i do whenever i help one of my seniors get a job
6501096 but this was definitely more special because it was our first draft pick and because hes such a special kid ive known george since he was coming to our basketball camps in the sixth grade and i know where hes come from it means more to me than it might to a normal coach
6501097 he had signed with oregon state but his english wasnt good enough to get a good act score
6501098 he was going to play professionally over in europe but his handlers think he has a chance to play professionally here in the united states so we got involved with him and he finally made the test score and decided to sign with us hopefully thats going to be more than just a one year deal and hell stay here for four years and get his degree
6501099 our league has figured out that to compete against teams outside the conference we have to do it with shooting
6501100 because we have guys who can make shots 1 foot is not going to make a difference where i think youll see the line move make a difference is the teams that shoot it average most of the ones that kangas takes are a foot back anyway

6501259 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6501260 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6501261 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6501262 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6501263 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods

6501341 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6501342 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6501343 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6501344 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6501345 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6501346 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6501347 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign

6501355 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6501356 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6501357 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6501358 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6501359 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6501360 bereits vor wochen gab es hinweise dass hier kleine kinder angequatscht werden
6501361 und gefunden hat die polizei hier auch nichts da mussten wieder die zivilisten ran
6501362 mir geht es ganz schlecht ich trauere mit den eltern das ist ganz furchtbar
6501363 es tut so weh es ist immer schlimm wenn so etwas passiert aber wenn es in der n he passiert ist es schrecklich
6501364 wir k nnen nicht mit gewissheit sagen ob es sich um eine kinderleiche handelt
6501365 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6501366 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6501367 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6501368 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6501369 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6501370 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6501371 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6501372 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6501373 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6501374 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6501375 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6501376 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6501377 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6501378 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6501379 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6501380 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6501381 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6501382 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6501383 i am sick and tired of the president of the united states embarrassing me the world we live in is too complex to entrust it to someone else whose idea of intellectual curiosity and grasp of foreign policy issues is to tell us he can look into vladimir putins eyes and see into his soul
6501384 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6501385 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6501386 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6501387 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6501388 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6501389 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6501390 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6501391 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6501392 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6501393 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6501394 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6501395 vor allem ist die subkomponente der bezahlten preise deutlich zur ckgekommen und die besch ftigung daf r angezogen
6501396 das sieht wie eine klare abwehr von swiss life awd aus
6501397 damit hat sich auch das ewige ger cht um ein interesse von axa an mlp realisiert
6501398 die zahlen und der ausblick spiegeln nur die neue realit t nach der gewinnwarnung vom 9 juli wider
6501399 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6501400 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6501401 the fed is getting into areas that are not typically thought to require the degree of independence that monetary policy does
6501402 the financial markets are currently going through their most turbulent period in years the credit crunch continues to bite the dollar is collapsing and taking the pound down with it and a uk recession seems an inevitability commodities prices are going haywire asias on the rise theres a lot for investors to keep on top of and its changing every day thats where the fleet street daily comes in a brand new 100 free service that keeps you plugged into the financial stories that really matter
6501403 der schatten f llt auch auf alle anderen im team
6501404 kann doch keiner sagen dass das vom himmel f llt
6501405 so etwas ist der super gau f r unseren sport da muss man sich sicherlich auch gedanken dar ber machen ob unser sport weiter eine chance hat zur olympischen familie zu geh ren
6501406 er hatte keine erkl rung f r den positiven befund
6501407 ich pers nlich bin am mittwoch gegen 21 00 uhr informiert worden als ich auf dem pferd sa wir haben jetzt 10 00 uhr am tag darauf die zeit war zu knapp weitere informationen einzuholen ich beantrage das ergebnis der a und b probe zur kenntnis zu nehmen und werde mich sp ter zu dem fall u ern
6501408 wir haben in den letzten jahren zigfach ber die dopingproblematik gesprochen
6501409 die entt uschung ist auch deshalb so immens weil wir wissen was wir unternommen haben um so etwas zu unterbinden
6501410 ich habe nichts gegen ein bisschen mehr sex und glamour wenn dadurch das interesse f r unseren sport geweckt wird
6501411 the last time ireland had a similar squad which was the barcelona olympics we got a gold and a silver from michael carruth and wayne mccullough
6501412 all five of us have put the effort in and were all good enough to do well
6501413 just fighting him is like getting a gold medal for me because since last year ive always been hoping id get him again
6501414 ive improved little by little but its going to be ever so hard to beat him in china
6501415 bereits vor wochen gab es hinweise dass hier kleine kinder angequatscht werden
6501416 und gefunden hat die polizei hier auch nichts da mussten wieder die zivilisten ran
6501417 es tut so weh es ist immer schlimm wenn so etwas passiert aber wenn es in der n he passiert ist es schrecklich
6501418 wir k nnen nicht mit gewissheit sagen ob es sich um eine kinderleiche handelt
6501419 when the time comes i m going to nip it and tuck it all
6501420 o que se v em laranjeiras a mesma situa o de vila velha um dpj que tem capacidade para no m ximo tr s presos est com 27 um absurdo isso vamos correr atr s de todos os documentos para que possamos interditar tamb m o dpj de laranjeiras ou se resolve essa situa o ou muita delegacia vai fechar as portas temos ainda o dpj de guarapari com esse mesmo problema
6501421 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6501422 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6501423 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6501424 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6501425 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6501426 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6501427 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6501428 volunteers of briog id dhoire glaigh na h ireann who died on active service
6501429 the tour was given by family members friends and former comrades of the fallen volunteers despite atrocious weather conditions it was great to see such a large turnout and for everyone to stay for the duration of the tour
6501430 a tree planting ceremony took place at westland street to remember all those young people from the area who died during the conflict
6501431 the tour ended with emer gallagher great grand daughter of the cumann na mban volunteer elizabeth doherty reading the local roll of honour
6501432 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6501433 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6501434 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6501435 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6501436 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6501437 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6501438 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6501439 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6501440 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6501441 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6501442 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6501443 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6501444 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6501445 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6501446 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6501447 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6501448 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6501449 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6501450 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6501451 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles here against whom we have no enemies in the region
6501452 i think this is something the syrian president said which has no basis
6501453 we have always relied on calculations by which we will not provide syria with weapons that could destabilize forces in problematic regions
6501454 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation we appreciate russias courage in taking international initiative and in withdrawing forces from the conflict region we oppose any attempt to harm russias position
6501455 es importante no solo respaldar este tipo de propuestas que hacen a generar conciencia por parte de la poblaci n de la importancia no solo de tener una dieta saludable sino tambi n de la realizaci n de actividad f sica
6501456 desde la direcci n de deportes tambi n soslayamos y respaldamos este tipo de iniciativas porque no solo hacen a la salud y a la educaci n de nuestra comunidad sino tambi n y a trav s de la presencia de un medio del prestigio de canal 13 a la difusi n de necochea y a costo cero por ello seguiremos trabajando para continuar favoreciendo la realizaci n de este tipo de iniciativas tal como lo hemos venido realizando
6501457 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6501458 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6501459 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6501460 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6501461 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6501462 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6501463 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6501464 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6501465 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6501466 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6501467 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6501468 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6501469 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6501470 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6501471 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6501472 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6501473 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6501474 but not as much as they care about their minute of advertising
6501475 every advertiser wants to be associated with an event that has become one of the most viewed in television history
6501476 the whole goalie thing the loss all those goals scored against us it was tough
6501477 then seeing that its somewhat their culture i guess to rub peoples noses in it i dont get too bent out of shape with what other people are doing im like whatever it is what it is hey theyre confident players
6501478 they dont think we can do it but it just fires me up there are going to be critics no matter what you do
6501479 yeah we didnt come out strong against norway and we lost the first game but i think it worked to our advantage were proving people wrong and were going to prove people wrong with another good game of soccer
6501480 its not kick and run its not longball its not depending on one player to get it done
6501481 no we dont have mia no we dont have abby no we dont have all of those pioneers who built the program but in my mind weve got 18 stars and id rather have a team of 18 united people than a team with a few stars
6501482 ive never felt so close to a team off the field
6501483 before there was a little segregation there were little groups within the team but now we so united we believe in each other
6501484 were having a lot of fun off the field and it helps what we do on the field if you dont have that good team chemistry it affects things on the field
6501485 weve played them weve played them in the world cup weve played them this year its another soccer game against another soccer team so bring it on
6501486 today afghanistan has demonstrated that it can and will succeed in the face of adversity with the determination commitment and hard work of its most precious resource the young people of afghanistan
6501487 thecheappop com is a terrific site for pop culture news with lots of original material all written with wit and good nature its been running strong since october 2005 in web terms a near miracle of staying power
6501488 this picture solves an old family mystery my great grandfather who fought on the side of great britain in the boer war often told a story
6501489 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6501490 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6501491 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6501492 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6501493 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6501494 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6501495 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6501496 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6501497 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6501498 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6501499 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6501500 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6501501 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6501502 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6501503 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6501504 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6501505 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6501506 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6501507 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6501508 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6501509 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6501510 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6501511 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6501512 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6501513 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6501514 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6501515 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6501516 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6501517 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6501518 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6501519 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6501520 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6501521 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6501522 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6501523 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6501524 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6501525 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6501526 an engineer reconnaissance team is a tight knit unit and these men were no exception
6501527 they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission as combat engineers they were proud resourceful and armed with technical knowledge they generously used in this mission to help the people of kandahar
6501528 respected by his subordinates his peers and his superiors for his outstanding professionalism and his operational experience and his competence he was a devoted father who liked to share stories of his children with his colleagues and his friends
6501529 i dont know that the taliban are getting any stronger
6501530 what i would say is that theyre much more aggressive this fighting season than theyve been in the past
6501531 not holding any of the ground theyre attacking us on so in the case of an ied strike they will inflict some casualties but they dont control the road that they inflicted the casualties on so the net effect is zero other than it whittles away at our resolve
6501532 explosive of unknown origin while performing a combat patrol operation
6501533 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6501534 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6501535 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6501536 compassion and non violence can overcome intolerance and oppression beautiful ideals to be associated with the olympic spirit
6501537 rallying together to denounce apple in offering songs for tibet for purchase
6501538 the predictably hostile response to the album from chinese internet users as reported by an official chinese media outlet reflects continued attempts to suppress any support for tibet at a time of crisis for the tibetan people as well as the level of entrenched misinformation about tibet propagated by the beijing government among the chinese public
6501539 itunes is not being blocked in china from our end but access to the itunes store is restricted in some areas in china this would also explain why its happening to your friends there as well i would advise that you contact your isp about this matter please also note though that accessing the us itunes store outside of the geographic region of the united states is not supported and that attempting to access it while in china is at your own risk

6501544 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6501545 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6501546 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6501547 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6501548 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6501549 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6501550 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6501551 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6501552 mi dispiace ma se le condizioni sono queste allora io sono troppo povera per fare lattrice
6501553 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6501554 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6501555 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6501556 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6501557 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6501558 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6501559 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6501560 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6501561 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6501562 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6501563 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6501564 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6501565 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6501566 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something

6501570 siempre es un temor para los que viajamos por el mundo entero en avi n
6501571 es un sitio muy hermoso y este viernes va a ser una noche muy especial
6501572 como reaccionan con ritmos caribe os como el merengue o la bachata
6501573 ayudan a difundir la m sica de estos pa ses
6501574 aunque hemos tenido la dicha de estar en un pa s que nos abri las puertas nunca debemos olvidar de donde venimos
6501575 los fans est n ah escuchando nuestra m sica y no se les puede pedir m s
6501576 ha asimilado muy bien los ritmos caribe os como la salsa o la bachata y ahora son los espa oles los que nos ense an esos bailes
6501577 por los propios compa eros del mundo de la m sica
6501578 al igual que pasa con los parques e licos que se ubican en zonas protegidas y de especial inter s av cola todas las grandes declaraciones de protecci n de suelo quedan al final supeditado a los intereses econ micos de las compa as el ctricas que a pesar de los anuncios de ser muy respetuosas con el medio ambiente solo lo tienen en cuenta como soporte para desarrollar su actividad industrial sin medir las consecuencias medioambientales de su actividad
6501579 si iberdrola u otras compa as el ctricas quieren desarrollar su actividad de distribuci n de energ a deben respetar los condicionantes en las que lo desarrollan y de la misma forma que no se les permitir a tendidos el ctricos de alta tensi n a baja altura o transformadores sin medidas que impidan el acceso de cualquier persona tampoco se les debe permitir que se supediten a sus intereses econ micos otro inter s igualmente protegido como es el medio ambiente sano
6501580 atentan contra la legislaci n que el propio partido popular ha aprobado como es el porn del parque natural que renuncia a implantar normativa mucho m s avanzada que ya existe
6501581 la generalitat como administraci n p blica debe ser la principal garante de los intereses generales y seguir con las talas de rboles de un parque natural largamente reivindicado por todos y finalmente declarado como tal en 2007 es un atentado a esos intereses generales m s cuando existen alternativas a los tendidos el ctricos a reos entre otras aprovechar las obras en otras infraestructuras que se van a realizar por la zona para enterrar o colocar en su proximidad estos tendidos

6501583 well have agreement when we have agreement so all of those stories in the newspapers about what the agreement says probably ought to be disregarded until we have an agreement
6501584 by the time i get back here im back on full alert
6501585 if we let nature take its course it will be 20 years before we see them for treatment
6501586 well hes young and hes got a funny name and you know hes not patriotic
6501587 well you know a plague on both their houses nobody is going to do anything to bring about change
6501588 the daily reckoning australia is a daily e letter offering an independent and critical perspective on the australian and global investment markets we tell you what news is worth paying attention to and what it might mean for your money
6501589 we go back and forth i dont know if its in our immediate future its something we talk about every few months well know when the time is right if were going to do it
6501590 if they would be as pretty as brad and angelinas kids we might
6501591 hes been relentlessly hounded by the media on the streets so he decided to push back
6501592 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6501593 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6501594 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6501595 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6501596 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6501597 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6501598 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6501599 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6501600 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6501601 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6501602 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6501603 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6501604 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6501605 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6501606 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6501607 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6501608 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically

6501614 las declaraciones demuestran que el tricolor negoci el reconocimiento de calder n
6501615 nos vimos obligados a aceptar los resultados de una elecci n fraudulenta en 2006 que impuso a un presidente en donde nosotros la bancada del partido revolucionario institucional est bamos en la disyuntiva de reconocerlo o desconocer las instituciones frente a ello el pri asumi su responsabilidad en la asunci n de felipe calder n
6501616 tuvimos una serie de negociaciones complejas en la instalaci n de la actual legislatura y fue para que todos los partidos presidieran comisiones pero ellos los panistas esperaban que las comisiones estuvieran a su servicio y ahora dicen que tenemos m s comisiones producto de los acuerdos pero eso es falso
6501617 demuestran que el pri negoci el reconocimiento de felipe calder n lo que confirma una vez m s que en 2006 hubo un fraude electoral para robarle la presidencia de la rep blica a andr s manuel l pez obrador
6501618 es la confesi n que el ex presidente vicente fox realiz el 13 de febrero de 2007 en estados unidos cuando dijo tras el fracaso del intento de desaforar a l pez obrador en 2005 para que no pudiera competir por la presidencia tuve que retirarme y perd pero 18 meses despu s me desquit cuando gan mi candidato

6501624 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6501625 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6501626 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6501627 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6501628 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6501629 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6501630 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6501631 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6501632 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc

6501654 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6501655 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6501656 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6501657 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6501658 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

6501732 its this dream not me thats bound to go away
6501733 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6501734 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6501735 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6501736 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6501737 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6501738 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning

6502195 the customs and border protection agency function is taking the approach that the border is a constitution free zone
6502196 congress needs to step in and reassert the american values of limited intrusion on americans private lives
6502197 this is just the latest in a long list of misguided dhs security policies from trying to waive all laws at the border to building a wall at the u s border to redirecting the automated tracking system from assessing the risk of cargo to assessing the risk of travelers to the most recent controversy over detaining laptops at airports it is clear the next administration will need to drastically rethink all of these wrongheaded policies
6502198 for months we have been preparing for what we expect will be some of the highest data usage levels weve seen on our network
6502199 we expect a very technologically savvy crowd to attend the convention that will want to stay connected we are significantly increasing network capacity to manage that need
6502200 last year at amp t managed a surge of wireless network traffic with the 2007 world series denver nuggets game and avalanche game all in the same weekend
6502201 in other words we are accustomed to planning and adding capacity for the increased network traffic that occurs at large scale events in colorado
6502202 the foundation has a mandate from the citizens of this community to build a performing arts center that will strengthen the downtown community and be the heart of san antonios cultural district

6502204 this world class venue is vital to enhancing the range quality and accessibility of cultural activities fostering arts education and contributing to the cultural life of san antonio
6502205 at amp ts generosity can be felt in every corner of our city
6502206 with this 5 million gift at amp t is continuing its investment in san antonio
6502207 for more than 80 years municipal auditorium has occupied a storied and central place in the world of san antonios cultural arts including the san antonio symphony ballet and opera
6502208 were happy that at amp t is a partner in this effort to restore this magnificent property to a place of glory in our city
6502209 for too many years san antonios performing arts organizations have gone without a facility they could call their own
6502210 but with at amp ts generosity and the rest of the communitys support of this worthwhile project i am confident the bexar county performing arts center foundation is going to deliver an outstanding permanent home for these groups

6502226 we link up with them and do joint patrols and give them some instruction get them used to working with locals and get people used to seeing them down here
6502227 the biggest thing here is getting out with the anbp letting the people see them get them trusting and working with the anbp if we are guests in the area and they only see us it doesnt quite seem like we are guests if we are accompanied by anbp we are perceived more as guests and partnering with them helps establish the government out here
6502228 im tasked with supervising the training of the anbp and what ive done is come up with a campaign plan on what i want them to learn and on what i want the marines to focus on until we are out of here
6502229 they are all willing to work ive built a special relationship with the platoon sergeant for this group of guys his name is nassar ahmad and his guys want to work they are real proud of what they do
6502230 especially patrols while driving and while hiking we learned we need to train more because the marines have techniques for patrols we hope to learn we like it
6502231 i enjoy being able to work with the marines its a good chance to work together and bring peace and security to afghanistan and its people they the insurgents are a big problem for us the border patrol and marines
6502232 the first day we started the job we had problems like we needed weapons supplies clothes boots and these things the marines and coalition forces help us they give us what they can
6502233 every time they come out they improve so the only challenge i have is me not being able to tell that platoon sergeant of that police officer what i want done i have to do it through a linguist
6502234 on yesterdays patrol i was watching some of the police officers take their own initiative to stop vehicles and turn them around like we briefed before we stepped off the things we are briefing are sticking and they are learning that is one of my goals that i wanted to hit
6502235 we are trying to get them into intelligence gathering from the local people and information operations sending messages out because they dont get a lot of news from the rest of the country so we are trying to get them to pass out news we also want them more involved with civil military operations like handing out chow clothing for children and school supplies
6502236 we were kind of overwhelmed by how much they didnt know then we got another group and these guys have been nothing but good things for us
6502237 from what ive seen and from what ive heard the locals are happy the trust hasnt always been there with the anbp and we are building it slowly the locals are happy to see these guys it puts an afghanistan face to what is being accomplished down here
6502238 people are coming up to talk to us telling us there is enemy activity in the area before they were afraid to tell us for fear of the insurgents coming in at night the night letters they are telling us these things because they know were out there and that the marines and anbp care enough to provide security for them
6502239 to serve my people and to protect my land and my people
6502240 people are happy when they see us together and they know that its a sign of afghanistan that we have the coalition forces like the marines to keep the area safe they like the idea of us working together
6502241 they are very similar in that they want their country to be safe they want to control the area they want to work down here and they are very excited to be able to come down and patrol with us i think having those guys just like in iraq was essential to controlling the area as long as we get those guys working with us and the more of them we get the quicker we can work ourselves out of a job
6502242 they speak the same language and once we leave the area they will be the ones controlling it so the more we can get those guys out with us the more influence they will have the more trust is built and the more the government is established down here
6502243 we wont always be in this country eventually we will be leaving the afghanistan national police and anbp will be here all we want to do is leave that lasting impression
6502244 the us government is wisely spending your tax dollars stay tuned to hear how government funding is making for a better sewage plant in your hometown
6502245 we know that on that date iraq will be safe
6502246 in this example we check that the parameters are not null then access the parameters object using e currenttarget params if your function will open a link for example and you pass a url identified in the parameters object as pagelink then you can use this by calling e currenttarget params pagelink
6502247 the mouseevent triggering the function e has a property called currenttarget this will be one of the menu items so inside that menu item access the params object and from that extract the variable named pagelink this will be a url string so then open the page or whatever

6502255 disparaging someone who has done well may have a negative effect in the future causing the person to become discouraged or resentful as well as undermining their self esteem thereby contributing to a subsequent poor performance such a coach is like the abusive parent who is continually belittling his or her offspring for not measuring up and even dog trainers know that you dont get the best performance out of the dog with angry shouts and kicks and when an athlete doesnt perform as well as hoped in the future the critical coach is apt to blame the athlete rather than his or her own non supportive behavior
6502256 its very rarely that i open us weekly and see myself in it and thats the way i like it
6502257 my parents are exactly who you think theyre very straightforward they are highly blunt they say exactly what theyre thinking in terms of their public image versus the reality at home i dont think there is that much of a divide

6502264 practicing gratitude helps people extract the most out of life
6502265 people can also experience an overall shift to a more benevolent view of the world i think its kind of a spiritual shift for some people because it makes them more aware of life as a gift

6502267 naikan gratitude grace and the japanese art of self reflection
6502268 what have i received today what have i given what trouble have i caused
6502269 when i list everything i received and then everything i gave each day what i have in the giving column is always so much shorter than whats in the receiving column
6502270 as we become aware that weve received so much more than weve given not only does that cultivate gratitude it also cultivates often a sense of wanting to give something back to the world
6502271 one of the mistakes people often make in our culture is thinking you have to feel grateful to practice gratitude
6502272 you can practice anytime when you feel sorrow great anxiety over a parents imminent death if you have a disabled child whatever one can muster at these points as a prayer of gratitude okay im still breathing or i have friends who care about me tips the experience from being immersed unmindfully in ones suffering to moving into the present moment with a more holistic perspective we see that there is suffering but there is also this gratitude and we can hold them together
6502273 on the first day of spring i was raking the gravel off the grass it was hard and i was starting to complain to myself
6502274 when i caught myself thinking i switched over to thank you i remembered i really wanted to rake and i wanted springtime gratitude practice for me is about letting go of thinking and welcoming in the present moment
6502275 in our family every evening when we have dinner we say our thank yous
6502276 its not a formal prayer of any kind but just what were grateful for in the moment and thats all it brings us back its a touchstone to the miracles of life that we may have been overlooking
6502277 the only real problem we see with them the gambling machines is people are playing the machines and spending their whole pay checks and getting in a financial bind in their bills and not being able to provide for their kids

6502301 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6502302 directed the authorities to make efforts to expose the hidden hands behind the incident
6502303 our bombers carried out todays attack it is in reaction to military operations in swat and bajaur
6502304 similar attacks will be carried out in other cities of pakistan including lahore islamabad and rawalpindi
6502305 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge

6502308 we would like to clarify that his holiness did not mention any number of casualties
6502309 in response to a question from the journalist about recent news stating that chinese troops had fired on a demonstration his holiness clearly stated that we had no specific information on the number of casualties
6502310 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6502311 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6502312 redoubling efforts to bring it a deal to a final conclusion
6502313 it has taken us a very long time but we are very very close to close this agreement
6502314 still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6502315 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable
6502316 following the hard work over the last weeks continental has come to an acceptable overall concept

6502343 justice department reaches agreement to protect employment rights of u s army reservist
6502344 clerks office violated the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act of 1994 userra the clerks office failed to reemploy marshall in her prior position as supervisor of the clerks court clerk ii section of the circuit criminal division when she return from active duty in october 2005 in addition it is alleged that the clerks office retaliated against marshall after she took action under userra by transferring her from the clerks circuit criminal division to the clerks traffic department which offered a lower pay rate
6502345 under the terms of the settlement agreement the clerks office will reinstate marshall to manager of the court clerk area of the clerks circuit criminal division and pay her a 2 500 monetary award
6502346 the civil rights division of the department of justice assumed responsibility for the enforcement of userra with respect to state and local governments and private employers in september 2004

6502348 we can expect with high probability this year will be cooler than the previous five years
6502349 definitely the la nina should have had an effect how much we cannot say
6502350 up to july 2008 this year has been cooler than the previous five years at least it still looks like its warmer than average
6502351 of course at the beginning of the year there was la nina and that would have had the effect of suppressing temperatures somewhat as well
6502352 but actually la nina is showing signs of moving towards a more neutral state
6502353 the media sets the rules and the obama campaign is merely following them if they dont theyll lose and so will the country and the middle east

6502363 last year we went to seaworld san diego and saw michaels female counterpart michelle and even though the show was a little funnier than this one nothing compares to watching michael almost hover over the water after launching his trainer into the air

6502366 most people who collect art or any other unique items like wine or racehorses do it for the enjoyment plus the thrill of the chase
6502367 they enjoy looking for it finding it learning about it and meeting people of like interests
6502368 the vast majority of horse purchases are not profitable but when they are they can be enormously so
6502369 but its far more than just financial its about the great love and joy of owning a successful racehorse its fun and enormously gratifying
6502370 it is possible to make money through investing in certain top wines especially from bordeaux
6502371 however it is certainly not as easy as it is often suggested
6502372 we believe that investing in fine wine can be a seriously good investment
6502373 as with all investments however a prospective investor should pick his or her adviser carefully and fully understand the investment philosophy followed by his or her chosen adviser
6502374 there has been only the slightest hint of softening in prices and thats really more of a flattening out of the growth curve
6502375 a lot of the value in collecting cars comes from the psychic income you get from owning them taking them out on a saturday afternoon and having everyone stop to wave or going to car shows
6502376 you buy a car you are passionate about and anticipate the passion of others
6502377 some athletes couldnt even come to the games so it is a bit unfair its not a level playing field
6502378 its a dilemma its a hard decision and certainly the outcome is not decided
6502379 it is imperative that new zealands emissions trading scheme is passed into law this parliamentary term
6502380 this is very much a case of something being better than nothing the climate is in crisis and new zealand has virtually no policy in place to start addressing it
6502381 the national partys calls for the scheme to be delayed are irresponsible and must be ignored
6502382 they are based on nothing more than the bleating of a core group of big polluting businesses
6502383 our message to the green party is that we need an emissions trading scheme but not this one

6502400 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6502401 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6502402 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6502403 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6502404 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6502405 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6502406 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6502407 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6502408 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6502409 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

6502413 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6502414 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6502415 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6502416 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6502417 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6502418 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6502419 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6502420 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6502421 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6502422 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6502423 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6502424 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6502425 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6502426 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6502427 the possibility of a block is high and id say it should be due to a content issue
6502428 weve seen the situation but cant offer any more information
6502429 who said that the cabinet has given the okay to hezbollah to carry out any action against israel
6502430 major efforts and there have been no complaints against hezbollah
6502431 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hezbollah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hezbollah
6502432 during the second lebanese war we considered the possibility of attacking lebanons infrastructure but we never resorted to this option because we thought at the time that not all the lebanese were responsible for the hezbollah attacks
6502433 its very concerning that this could have and did happen in st neots election crime is serious because it undermines the democratic basis of our society however taking all the circumstances into account it seems that an appropriate outcome has been reached in this case i will now be considering this matter with david monks and members of the elections panel to see how we might avoid the possibility of it happening again
6502434 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6502435 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6502436 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6502437 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6502438 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6502439 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6502440 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6502441 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6502442 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6502443 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6502444 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6502445 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6502446 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6502447 this is a planning took where all things are going
6502448 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of august 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6502449 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6502450 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
6502451 there has not been much evidence of any significant russian withdrawals there have been what i would call some minimal movements to date
6502452 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6502453 we always loved russians but the thing they are doing now is that they are ruining everything terrorizing people killing looting
6502454 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6502455 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6502456 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6502457 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6502458 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6502459 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6502460 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6502461 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6502462 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6502463 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6502464 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6502465 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6502466 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6502467 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6502468 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6502469 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6502470 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6502471 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6502472 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6502473 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6502474 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6502475 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6502476 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6502477 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6502478 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6502479 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6502480 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6502481 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6502482 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6502483 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6502484 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6502485 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6502486 my l e to dlatego i jestem w chinach po raz pi ty jestem tu popularny od 1999 r ale tego lata nie wiedzia em e jestem taki wielki
6502487 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6502488 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6502489 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6502490 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6502491 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6502492 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6502493 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6502494 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6502495 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6502496 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6502497 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6502498 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6502499 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6502500 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6502501 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

6502506 i cant be happy with my debut but ill quickly put that behind me now weve just got to knuckle down
6502507 he has grown in stature over the last year since gary neville has been out injured
6502508 when he was at leeds i thought he was the leader bossing people about but when he came to united with big personalities like neville he became a lot quieter and left it to other people it was interesting that once neville got injured he took it upon himself to be the voice at the back there are not a lot of captains in the united team and the manager likes to have a few who are vocal he probably had a word with rio and it has had an effect on his game rio has the respect of everybody around him because of what he has achieved in the game

6502513 there is a real need for strengthening the capacity of countries particularly in africa in coping with such climate shocks
6502514 the negotiations need to speed up and become more concrete if governments are to meet the deadline they set for themselves
6502515 there has been no single country that has spoken against
6502516 they would like to see it implemented in different ways but nobody has tried to kill the proposal off everyone wants it to happen
6502517 agreeing to halve emissions by 2050 is one thing we must have midterm targets
6502518 all the players cannot wait for the croatia game with what they did to us embarrassed us a bit
6502519 we cant wait to get over there and beat them
6502520 because of them and also maybe because of ourselves as well we were not at the euros so we want to pay them back
6502521 we always have a point to prove we believe we have the players to do well in these major tournaments
6502522 we have not done so in the past few years but hopefully this can change for us and we can do well
6502523 we have all been looking forwards to this after not qualifying for euros
6502524 we will all be ready and willing to give our best hopefully it will be good enough
6502525 maybe at times i am a bit too honest and at club level the manager is telling me not to defend too much to try and save some energy for when we are attacking
6502526 but sometimes you just want to win the ball back and work hard for the team that is just how i play
6502527 maybe it does affect my goals tally but hopefully i can learn and get better
6502528 of course we are playing slightly differently with a different formation we can still learn and do better
6502529 it does take time to play under a new management team we have had quite a few friendlies now and hopefully we can get it right
6502530 before every big tournament fans expect a lot of big things from players and the players desperately want to give them something to be happy about hopefully that can come soon
6502531 no matter what the performances though the players always give their all

6502536 if this non surgical procedure provides results that are comparable to those of conventional weight loss surgeries it may provide a good option for patients who need to lose a significant amount of weight but do not wish to have surgery
6502537 thats less than we typically see with gastric bypass surgery
6502538 however when compared to laparoscopic or open surgeries endoscopic procedures generally result in quicker recoveries shorter hospital stays and fewer complications
6502539 patient risk factors and other issues largely beyond doctors control
6502540 if patients develop any of these medical problems during their hospital stays medicare will not reimburse the hospital at the higher rate for treating these complications it will still pay to treat the primary diagnosis and other complications the rule does not alter payment for the physicians who provide that care
6502541 its a lot of work but ive cleared a path from my bedroom to the coffee maker and i thought maybe that would do for now

6502762 the gaea universe is a richly textured world of human relationships futuristic space travel and exploration the storys strength lies in its endearing characters and wonderful settings
6502763 at its core gaea is a universal story with sometimes flawed but noble characters
6502764 set in 2049 79 the films themes of family space colonization and the dire consequences of climate change will engage a global audience dwindling natural resources and the lingering threat of nuclear war are backdrops of both hope and despair for mankind
6502765 i was blown away by the visual worlds that the gaea team created and how well the human and sci fi action integrates
6502766 i am thrilled to be a part of the team bringing this story to the big screen
6502767 it was always important to us that the novel stood on its own merits wanting to gauge genuine reactions to the story as well as offer those people involved with making the film fuller backgrounds on its characters we slipped it out in hardback without any marketing or fanfare
6502768 the positive response has been amazing word of mouth and upbeat reviews saw the book reach many more readers than expected weve been getting e mails from fans eager to know how soon the sequel will be out

6502778 for a number of reasons individuals make claims or commit acts that weaken national unity and cohesion due to their racist tribal ethnic or xenophobic character
6502779 by enacting these measures the state will heal open wounds between ivory coast communities and create an environment that fosters social harmony
6502780 what kinds of actions would be covered at what point would they be considered criminal
6502781 we should proceed carefully because such a law could become a barrier to freedom of expression
6502782 over the last decade ivory coast has gained a reputation for being xenophobic adopting such a law counts as both a partial acknowledgment of this fact and a solution to the problem
6502783 applied properly it will address the problem at its root by making it impossible for ivorians to think of immigrants racial ethnic or religious differences in negative terms as with the elimination of the residency card last november the goal is to restore a sense of justice for those who have been mistreated
6502784 what disturbs us about this law is that we havent completed the studies
6502785 there are some gaps where the law fails to take into account current circumstances especially with regards to political parties and tribal issues
6502786 politicians rely on tribalism for political mobilisation when ethnic groups honor the head of state they do so according to tribal customs we in civil society are waiting to see how this law will be applied
6502787 whats most important is a peaceful living environment that allows us to contribute to the development of our host country and as a consequence that of our mother country also one must always respect the law and by the same token well fulfill our duties
6502788 its a step towards better relations between ivory coast and neighboring countries since the ouagadougou accord was signed in burkina faso march 2007 weve been working tirelessly for peace this law and the abolition of residency cards are signs that things are back to normal
6502789 we must strengthen ties of friendship brotherhood and cooperation between ivory coast and all neighboring countries and extending beyond that to all of west africa the continent and our friends throughout the world
6502790 eliminating the residency cards and adopting a law against xenophobia will guarantee him support of neighbouring governments and their expatriate communities within ivory coast

6502857 if you want harder hitting stuff from obama you might like this new tv ad tying john mccain to ralph reed and jack abramoff but the ad is running in atlanta only
6502858 mccains foreign policy approach is rooted in mixed with hysterical over reaction
6502859 the big concern with a mccain presidency a concern which i am surprised has not been vocalized more fully is that the u s will lurch from crisis to crisis confrontation to confrontation whether it be with iran north korea russia syria saudi arabia etc the danger is that mccains pundit like rhetoric will entrap the u s in descending spiral of foreign policy brinksmanship just think about the very likely scenario of mccain giving iran russia a rhetorical ultimatum and iran russia ignoring it now we are stuck either we lose face by not following through on our threats or we follow through and go to war we cant afford such a reckless approach after the last eight years for the next eight we need a president not a pundit
6502860 for anyone who had eyes to see georgia was a perfect illustration of this mccain totally flew off the handle ramping the situation up dramatically with his unstable rhetoric
6502861 max bergmann had the excellent insight that perhaps the key to understanding john mccains hysteria based foreign policy is that it reflects the mindset of a television pundit mccain spends a ton of time going on television and talking max mentions that one of the first things mccain did after 9 11 was go on just about every tv program where he incidentally called for attacking about four countries and consistently over the years gone on tv and sounded the alarm ratcheted up the rhetoric and often called for military action with almost no regards to the practical implications of such an approach thus he can for example go on tv and call casually for a land invasion of serbia knowing hell never be held accountable for any problems since the clinton administration wont do it and then just forget about the whole thing in later years when the more responsible approach turns out to have been okay
6502862 today at a townhall meeting an audience member praised sen john mccain r az for his vow to follow bin laden to the gates of hell after a long question about veterans care the questioner said she believed we needed to reinstate the draft to which mccain seemed to readily agree
6502863 this is absolutely amazing a woman told john mccain today that we might need a draft to accomplish all his foreign policy goals and he said he didnt disagree so there you have it mccain draft
6502864 anyone of draft age should watch anyone with kids who are draft age or approaching draft age should watch this video as john wrote last night mccains instinct is to go to war today mccain exposed how hell have the forces to do it the draft is part of his equation
6502865 this kind of talk was on the internets in 2004 but wasnt completely pushed by democrats and there wasnt actual video of the gop candidate basically agreeing that we need a draft
6502866 this is bound to cause some headaches for the mccain campaign
6502867 sen john mccain r ariz said in an interview wednesday that he was uncertain how many houses he and his wife cindy own i think ill have my staff get to you mccain told politico in las cruces n m its condominiums where ill have them get to you the correct answer is at least four located in arizona california and virginia according to his staff newsweek estimated this summer that the couple owns at least seven properties
6502868 like many americans john mccain has a hard time remembering just marshall
6502869 throughout the campaign there have been various trivialities that have taken on enormous political significance nearly everyone can no doubt rattle more than a few examples off the top of their heads haircuts arugula bowling scores lapel pins etc but i have a hunch not one of these is as humiliating as its one thing to be so extraordinarily wealthy that you own multiple homes its another to be so extraordinarily wealthy that you cant even remember how many homes you own
6502870 is mccains memory really that poor and if so what does it say about his ability to be president or is the number of houses he has such an unimportant question to him that its not worth remembering that he has a house everywhere he goes so why bother singling them out to remember or maybe its a politically inconvenient question and he knows most reporters will give him a pass
6502871 how rich do you have to be and how cognitively impaired to not remember how many homes you have folks this is just weird mccains oddly inconsistent mental state is a serious valid question in this election and the media seems afraid to address it head on real people dont have so many homes that they cant remember unless theyre absurdly rich or theyre losing their faculties mccain didnt make these kind of gaffes eight years ago when he was 64 whats going on note to democrats this is manna from heaven run a freaking ad about this non stop
6502872 i like joe lieberman hed be a terrific secretary of state but i dont want another old guy particularly an old pro choicer though he was pro life until he ran with algore being vice president i realize mccain loves history and we had the whole lincoln johnson ticket at the start of the gop but this would be the end of the gop bookending the life of the party with a democrat for vice president not to mention the legal issues
6502873 if mccain were to head into a convention having just announced a pick like lieberman a man very well liked by republicans for his views on one set of issues but not on many others and therefore a perfect cabinet member but a very imperfect vp choice he would find himself in a very uncomfortable position in minneapolis he would be surrounded by people he had just upset would have brought lots of activists together at just the moment he had also opened up a huge rift over an issue that republicans have managed reasonably well in recent years and will have made the differences between lieberman and much of the party and especially the differences over abortion the central issue of the convention and the main topic of conversation among the observers and reporters who will color the publics impression of the event and thus will have made it unlikely that the partys best public face will be put forward
6502874 doesnt rudy giuliani s experience in the primaries argue against a pro choice pick here you had a candidate who had a lot going for him and whose principal defect was his pro choice position and he absolutely bombed doesnt that tell us something about where the partys sentiment is
6502875 things are going well for mccain right now and he should be optimistic about his prospects in november if he chooses ex pa gov tom ridge it will cause a huge uproar within the republican base that will derail at least temporarily his surge pawlenty conversely is a safe choice and in my opinion a far better one given the current economic climate and the unfair attacks on that issue that obama is launching against mccain who better than the blue collar sams club tim pawlenty as a running mate beyond that tim has superb political skills when the country sees him it will like him
6502876 the last month has been excruciating for obama supporters watching him and his campaign squander so many hopes and resources on an utterly wimpy campaign obama is lucky he is not further behind already and he is going to fade fast if he just runs a feel good bland convention about abstract hope and change in addition to getting gritty and colorfully clear about his recipe for making americans lives better and about his approach to make this nation safer and stronger in the world obama needs to signal all the major speakers at next weeks convention to go after mccain in a key part of each speech we need to hear why mccain is wrong and dangerous and no longer so honest and honorable it needs repeating with force and humor and passion otherwise the convention will be wasted and this historic turning point for our country will be lost
6502877 whatever the obama campaign is doing right now in terms of messaging isnt working very well they have a 35 1 lead in voter contacts a 3 1 lead in field offices a substantial lead in free media coverage and even a lead in paid media so we have the campaign infrastructure and this is a big democratic year given that mccain continues to close despite all this is a clear indication that mccain and his surrogates affiliated organizations are doing a better job of messaging than obama and his surrogates affiliated organizations
6502878 because obama refuses to go hard negative and because he believes in submarine advertising rather than national advertising he loses the spin cycle more often than he wins it earned media dwarfs any and all channels that any campaign controls as a result john mccain is defining obama rather than obama defining obama john mccain is also defining john mccain
6502879 look the race is tightening at the national level but its much less tight when you look at the state by state numbers that you know actually decide the presidency weve got the veep announcements and the conventions to get through and then the race will start in earnest be zen keep your eye on the composite obama still leads that by 1 4 percent and maintain perspective mccain has never crossed the 45 percent threshold while obama bobs between 45 and 50 ill be officially worried when mccain shows the ability to break that barrier of support if he suddenly starts hovering in the upper 40s then we might have trouble but ultimately this is a state by state battle and in the electoral college fight obama still has a solid lead without even taking into account the ground machine obama is building pollsters arent
6502880 its not a completely analogous situation but i can think of plenty of times i heard obama fans handwringing last fall when it appeared he just wasnt going to be able to defeat hillary clinton obama was however taking his time methodically executing a specific strategy i underestimated him more than a few times before but he managed to do pretty well and im still inclined to give the campaign team at least some of the benefit of the doubt
6502881 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6502882 dont ever demand someone stop attacking you doesnt work dont do it sounds weak sounds pathetic and a lot else
6502883 marshalls advice makes sense growing up a nerd i never found that complaining about being picked on made me more popular doubt that it works among adults either let me offer obama some more free advice of my own also worth every penny dont defund the 527s no one is going to vote for you because you stopped the evil 527 money from entering politics however people might very well vote for you because the 527s unleashed a 125 million spending barrage against your opponent target white democrats bring them into the fold by attacking mccain as a republican maybe even with a 30 second spot that just keeps repeating john mccain is a republican over and over and over lob something partisan their way to rally around the flag with attack mccains age this might seem more dangerous and however it would seem foolish to avoid it at this point because all of the clever attacks are being directed at obama we need to turn the tables and this would help out quite a bit
6502884 go after mccains strengths do it now and do it at the convention let your surrogates off the leash when it comes to the national meta narrative it should be all about how mccain is the darling of the beltway elite punditocracy how hes a far right winger that is indistinguishable from bush cheney shows no independence and that he has no power of prediction he makes horrible judgments hes hot tempered and distrusted by his colleagues and hes showing age related mental diminishment this is tough stuff but its all true and this election is too important to leave things to chance mccain needs a fist in his mouth every day so that he has no room to maneuver
6502885 from realist to neocon environmentalist to driller maverick to party man theres more than enough raw material in mccains shimmying to define the guy however you want maverick could have been redefined as an epithet this years version of flip flopper but his supposed political opponents have been uninterested in actually using any of it barack obama appends his every mention of mccain with a disclaimer about his enormous esteem for mccains service and patriotism he says in other words that mccain does indeed exhibit an unquestionable commitment to high minded public service then he sometimes says mccain is wrong on some policies thats charming and all but as says its not enough the liberal allergy to attacking character rather than conclusions may be admirable but it doesnt exactly help them win elections
6502886 obama protected infanticide in order to protect abortion on demand there simply is no other explanation except abject stupidity
6502887 obama abortion radical this should end the issue for even nominal catholics and long ago evangelicals
6502888 nurse jill stanek said that at her hospital abortions were repeatedly performed by inducing the live birth of a pre viable fetus and then leaving it to die when she made her report the attorney general said that no law had been broken thats why legislators proposed a bill to fill the gap obama did not want the gap filled he did not want pre viable fetuses infants to have any legal protection in the illinois legislature he argued that providing them with legal protection would both be unconstitutional in itself a violation of the supreme courts abortion jurisprudence and undermine the right to abortion
6502889 ramesh asks how big a vulnerability is obamas born alive vote for obama i submit that its a tremendous vulnerability last month i mentioned that some ohio politicos told me that focus group data showed the born alive issue to be highly radioactive almost no one had heard about it but when told the specifics the reactions were nearly universal brief incredulity followed by revulsion im unaware of any recent focus group or polling data on the matter but this is such a gut issue that such data may be superfluous do you know anyone who would vote the same way as obama not one member of the senate did that kind of uniformity on a substantive issue is stunning and an ominous barometer for obama
6502890 people keep trying to align ayers with barack obama its really unfortunate theyre friends so what people do make mistakes in the past you move on this is a new century a new time he reflects back and hes been making a strong contribution to our community
6502891 this wont fly because as recently as last fall ayers was filmed ranting about the fascist america of today ayers is an unrepentant terrorist and obamas friendship with him calls the nominees judgment into question no matter what contribution the terrorist has made to his community
6502892 theyre friends so what well most americans dont have friends who plotted to bomb the pentagon or assisted radicals in robberies that resulted in murder
6502893 note that daley says that people do make mistakes in the past although william ayers has never expressed regret for setting bombs in places like the u s capitol and womens bathrooms in the pentagon
6502894 pick a fighter for vp please do it yesterday obama you need someone who will push hard at your side and make you better too and you never should have gone on vacation shades of john kerry without a vp to carry on joe biden will work i think but and i never expected to believe this it might be time to turn to hillary she is at least a fighter and this election really matters to a lot more than you and her
6502895 ive come around to the idea that obama might deem clintons presence on the ticket a necessity at this point and given that biden is apparently
6502896 barack obama might just need hillary clinton clinton whether appropriately or not seen by a great many americans as someone who knows her way around the international stage she also has some pretty good connections in the swing states of michigan ohio and pennsylvania then there is the whole dream ticket thing if obama takes the stage in springfield with clinton at his side it will be the dominant news story of the weekend the convention and perhaps of the fall campaign indeed it could create that wave of excitement that obama needs to have not just a triumphal convention but a triumphal campaign one does not have to like clinton or even believe that clinton will ultimately join a dream ticket to suspect that as the obama camp reviews the latest polls they might be spinning the scenario one last time
6502897 the case for picking clinton doesnt have all that much to do with obamas deteriorating poll numbers although you can certainly make a separate argument based on the electoral math rather its that the republicans have shown their hand and made it clear that they arent going to be running any sort of nice safe campaign where obama coasts to victory while the base stays asleep i think that if obama picks clinton the republicans are likely to overplay their hand one thing that obama has not really been able to do is to generate some organic level of backlash when he is attacked this is separate and distinct from the notion of fighting back it is voters stepping in and refereeing the match themselves voters recognize that mccain has gone negative but they arent really punishing him for it his favorables havent moved at all why not i think it has to do with the nature of obama he is new he is confident to the point of being arrogant and up until recently he has been leading with clinton on the other hand voters naturally want to come to her defense and overzealous attempts to whip the republican base into a frenzy will be counteracted with outrage from significant numbers of older and working class women
6502898 the has obama leading 45 42 but obama still having trouble with clinton supporters picking clinton for vp would solve obamas problems to a great extent
6502899 obamas new media director joe rospars has no peers when it comes to knowing how to write an effective fundraising email hes done a terrific job at the things set out in the profile and more but for the life of me i cannot figure out why he hasnt pursued a blog outreach strategy to date im not talking about a constituency relationship or blogads but a strategic message one one that recognizes the blogs as being more powerful in concert with what the campaign is trying to do in opposition to mccain and coordinating the execution of that strategic message joe ought to do some outreach himself to peter daou who was in a similar situation in 04 with john kerrys campaign kerry had won the primary without any help at all from the blogs and it wasnt until after the swiftboating explosion in august that the kerry campaign realized they had a problem with controlling the message via the blogosphere it was probably too late for peter to do much but he certainly dived in and worked well with the blogosphere in those last few months to develop an opposition message strategy against george w bush now of course a number of things have changed including two big things which the obama campaign has recognized first blogs have went mainstream all the traditional media outlets have bloggers and they are 24 7 bloggers with access theyve effectively become the online outreach vehicles for the obama campaign message push the marc ambinder ben smith and jake tapper world second theres a world of social networking sites that have huge numbers of available for finding voters and for organizing supporters and the obama campaign has leveraged those like none other but neither have replaced the partisan blogosphere which has grown about 10x since 2004 in terms of bloggers and readership and without the outreach partisan democratic bloggers are left on their own to pursue a decentralized strategy which has largely wandered in the desert looking for an attack angle on mccain bloggers complain about there not being a consistent message from obama against mccain because nothing is being coordinated from within the campaign for outreach purposes

6502959 our dna analysis corroborates what the historical sources say namely that vanilla was a trade item brought to tahiti by french sailors in the mid 19th century the french admiral responsible for introducing vanilla to tahiti alphonse hamelin used vanilla cuttings from the philippines the historical record tells us that vanilla which isnt native to the philippines was previously introduced to the region via the manila galleon trade from the new world and specifically from guatemala
6502960 the pre columbian maya had been managing their forests for millennia to cultivate cacao and to make chocolate and we know they were also cultivating vanilla to use it as a chocolate spice the maya created these forest gardens by introducing different types of species of wild cacao and vanilla from the surrounding forests which meant that species that had previously been geographically separated were then able to hybridize because they were in the same place thats the scenario we present in our research paper for how tahitian vanilla got started it is an evolutionary product but also a maya artifact
6502961 pesach has demonstrated that vanilla species can exchange genes quite frequently across species barriers
6502962 this provides an opportunity to breed new commercial varieties of vanilla through hybridization in the future

6502977 we and others had demonstrated the existence of a dna detection pathway within cells but we are still early in our understanding
6502978 our findings offer an important piece of evidence that this pathway is not only very relevant but it can be the cause of severe autoimmune disease
6502979 just as commensal bacteria outnumber our own cells by four or five orders of magnitude endogenous retroelements outnumber our genes by at least 100 fold
6502980 both have the potential to be detected by the immune system and cause autoimmune disease therefore specific mechanisms evolved to prevent this and trex1 represents the first example of a mechanism to prevent autoimmunity caused by endogenous retroelements

6503227 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6503228 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6503229 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6503230 its a whole series of things that are not very important theyve got important sounding titles but reality of that nato russia council is they look for things to talk about

6503248 looking at the political situation in the united states the international community other parts of the world and in israel there is a kind of expectations to do something before the end of the year
6503249 i think that any attempt to try and bridge gaps that might be premature to reach or to reach something that is not the comprehensive agreement that we want to reach can lead to doing it wrong just because of the pressure the international pressure this can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence as we faced after camp david 2000 and the circumstances are in a way are similar

6503370 waarlijk ik durf wel te zeggen dat sir lancelot hem verwekte want nooit leken twee mannen meer op elkaar en het is ook geen wonder dat zijn krijgshaftigheid groot is
6503371 mevrouw om gods wil moet hij van nature zo een goede ridder zijn
6503372 want van beide kanten stamt hij van de beste ridders van de wereld af en uit het edelste geslacht want sir lancelot stamt in de achtste graad van onze heer jezus christus af en zo is sir galahad in de negende graad verwijderd van onze heer jezus christus daarom durf ik te zeggen dat zij de grootste edellieden van de wereld zijn
6503373 moeten wij onze heer jezus christus grote dank zeggen voor wat hij ons vandaag ter ere van het hoogfeest van pinksteren heeft getoond
6503374 we hebben vandaag te eten en te drinken gekregen waar we naar verlangden maar n ding is ons ontgaan we hebben de heilige graal niet gezien zo prachtig was ze bedekt daarom zweer ik nu een eed dat ik mij morgen zonder verwijl zal zetten tot de queeste van de heilige graal en dat ik een jaar en een dag of langer indien nodig uit zal blijven en niet naar het hof zal terugkeren tot ik haar duidelijker heb gezien dan hier werd getoond en als het mij niet mocht lukken zal ik terugkeren als n die niet tegen de wil van god op kan
6503375 u heeft me bijna gedood met die eed die u aflegde want daardoor hebt u mij beroofd van de edelste en trouwste ridderschap die ooit in enig rijk van deze wereld bijeen is gezien want ik weet zeker dat als zij van hier vertrekken zij elkaar niet allen meer zullen ontmoeten in deze wereld want velen zullen sterven in deze queeste en dat betreur ik niet weinig want ik heb van hen gehouden als van mijn eigen leven het vertrek van dit gezelschap zal mij deerlijk verdriet doen want ik was er aan gewoon geraakt ze in mijn nabijheid te hebben
6503376 sir gawain sir gawain groot verdriet heeft u mij gedaan want ik vrees dat mijn trouwe genootschap hier nimmer meer bijeen zal zijn
6503377 wees getroost want het zal voor ons een grote eer zijn veel meer dan dat we in een andere onderneming stierven en sterven zullen we toch
6503378 de grote liefde die ik al mijn levensdagen voor u heb gehad doet mij zulke treurige woorden spreken want er was nooit een christenkoning die zo vele waardige mannen aan zijn tafel had als ik vandaag aan de ronde tafel dat is mijn grote verdriet
6503379 dat mijn heer hen bij zich weg wil laten gaan
6503380 u die zich heeft verbonden aan de queeste van de heilige graal waarde heren de kluizenaar nacien laat u zeggen dat niemand in deze queeste een dame of een edelvrouw mee zal nemen want dat geeft geen pas in een dienst zo hoog als die waarin u zult gaan en ik zeg u ronduit hij die niet gezuiverd is van zijn zonden zal de mysteri n van onze heer jezus christus niet zien
6503381 daarvoor hoeft u zich niet te schamen want hij is de hoffelijkste ridder en stamt van de beste mannen van de wereld af van alle zijden een geslacht van koningen daarom moet u wel een uitmuntend man zijn wat uw daden betreft en ook
6503382 mevrouw als u het zo zeker weet waarom vraagt u het mij dan want wie mijn vader is zal openlijk bekend worden als de tijd daar is
6503383 ach gawain gawain u heb mij verraden want door u zal mijn hof nooit hersteld worden en u zult nooit zoveel verdriet om mij hebben als ik om u
6503384 ah hoffelijke ridder sir lancelot ik vraag u mij raad te geven want als het zou kunnen zou ik willen dat deze queeste ten einde was
6503385 u hebt zelf gezien hoeveel waardige ridders gisteren hebben gezworen dat ze er onder geen voorwaarde van terug zullen keren
6503386 maar ik zal zo treurig worden door hun vertrek dat geen enkel vermaak mij nog op zal kunnen beuren
6503387 ach sir lancelot sir lancelot u hebt me verraden en u vermoordt mij door zo mijn heer te verlaten
6503388 mevrouw ik wilde dat u niet verdrietig was want ik zal terugkomen zo snel als ik met ere kan
6503389 dat ik u ooit heb ontmoet maar moge hij die aan het kruis stierf voor heel de mensheid u leiden en behoeden en heel het gezelschap
6503390 me encuentro en un buen momento de forma y contento con mi punta de velocidad

6503394 recently one of the authors met with a focus group of young unwed mothers the women talked about their struggles frustration and feelings of bitterness and anger they regretted their inability to offer their children the kinds of loving care they had expected to give them regarding adoption the women felt that although they were failing to provide adequately they could not face the possibility of a final and total separation from their infants when they were asked about how they would feel about open adoption thier attititudes were totally different they thought they could face and even welcome adoption for their children if they could meet the adoptive parents help in the separation and move ot a new home and the maintain some contact with the child
6503395 open adoption was proposed by baran and her colleagues as a way of encouraging unmarried women and specifically unmarried white women to relinquish their babies for adoption at a time when they were increasingly choosing to raise them alone
6503396 adoption practices are changing partly in response to the falling relinquishment rate
6503397 taken together these studies suggest that more vigorous and frequent presentations of adoption options and the possible benefits of relinquishment outweight the possible risks to the practitioner client relationship
6503398 a review of the responses indicated that the major issue for the adolescent keeper and her mother was the extent to which the birth mother would have information about the baby as it grows up thus there was clear rejection of the idea of not knowing how the baby was doing as it grew up there was clear support for choosing the actual famiy who gest the baby for finding out how the baby is doing now and then for meeting three families and knowng for sure that one of them will get the baby and for seeing the baby as it grows up movement to a more open procedure which provides the birth mothers more choice and more information about the fate of her baby might indeed increase the consideration of adoption by pregnancy adolescents
6503399 of course the mere availability of open procedures will not be sufficient family professionals must take advantage of the opportunity to provide information guidance and counselling in support of open adoption
6503400 in a very general way openness benefits prospective parents because it may increase the pool of adoptable infants for biological parents to have some continuing knowledge about their relinquished child may help them to choose adoption as an option barth 1987 thus increasing the number of children available and decreasing the wait for an adoptable child
6503401 cocozzelli 1989 warns that the potential benefits of open adoption may persuade some adolescent mothers to relinquish a child who would not otherwise have done so those mothers who relinquish in the expectation of continued contact may risk prolonged uncertainty and grief
6503402 a confidential adoption may be a factor in the number of young women who choose to keep their babies rather we must be concerned to the extent that the cost of losing contact with the infant effects a rejection of adoption as a pregnancy outcome
6503403 as many young women who choose to place thier baby change their minds following the birth factors such as having met with the adoptive parents could affect these decisions
6503404 the effects of open adoption on biological and adoptive parents and the children the arguments and the evidence

6503424 new jerseys tax and regulatory climate is already chasing jobs from this state left and right and these new regulations will make matters worse
6503425 rather than conforming our policies to questionable scientific theories we should be looking at the concrete economic indicators that show our states economy is in trouble and we should be taking steps to help people who are losing jobs and being forced out of their homes by this states anti economic growth agenda not making matters worse
6503426 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey weve got a fish over here with two mouths
6503427 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
6503428 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
6503429 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tarsands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life
6503430 for the most part what we have been getting is natural parasites and fin erosion which are normal in sand bed rivers
6503431 throughout the 12 years there has been no significant impact shown from oilsands development
6503432 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesnt do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community
6503433 this is evidence and we need to ensure that is preserved
6503434 some of the community concern was that even if they were bringing them in fish for testing i dont think ramp was doing a great job in communicating back to those individuals about the testing

6503445 the grain filling stage is the second most critical stage in corn with pollination being the most critical
6503446 yield can be negatively impacted during grain fill by weather conditions such as excessive heat solar radiation wind and lack of rain late season irrigation is one tool that can be used wisely to minimize any negative weather effects so grain filling can continue and not be ended prematurely
6503447 daily yield gains of 4 to 5 bushels per acre are possible under good growing conditions during grain fill and daily yield increases of 2 to 4 bushels per acre are common
6503448 growers need to look at several factors before beginning an irrigation event
6503449 this includes reviewing the types of soil for each field looking at how well that soil stores water reserves and also the stage of the corn growers can contact their local pioneer agronomist for assistance on assessing water reserves and soil type
6503450 irrigation planning should be based on sound information about the crop soil water reserves and weather conditions
6503451 a specific calendar date for ending the irrigation season may be the worst choice producers need to be flexible and make decisions about the last irrigation event based on anticipated crop water needs and rainfall
6503452 one problem that occurs is that producers sometimes rely too much on soil water reserves that may have become overly depleted during the season
6503453 past studies have suggested soil water reserves could be depleted as much as 80 percent during the final stages of corn production without harming yield
6503454 that has not been our experience in this study yield reductions began to occur when available soil water reserves were as high as 50 percent it seems likely that with the great corn hybrids and other advanced production technologies we have today that less water stress can be tolerated without an appreciable economic impact for example a 5 percent reduction on 125 bushel per acre corn is much less important than a 5 percent reduction on 225 bushel per acre corn
6503455 this type of research offers growers sound agronomic advice on how to better manage their irrigation schedules
6503456 the research is particularly valuable to those who are impacted by declining water sources

6503463 if they are able to roll over their debt in late september and the dollar amount is substantial then it signals that the credit markets are comfortable enough with the current situation and with the government backstop and that buys them a fair amount of time
6503464 if that does not turn out well then the treasury if they have not already done so will at that point be forced to step in and act more quickly than they would have

6503507 anytime you have a rotation on the defensive line youre ok
6503508 but anytime you dont have a rotation thats when youll have problems we have five guys working in at defensive tackle and another five guys at defensive end so nobody is really going to have play more than 35 snaps a game thats pretty good
6503509 but i like extra points a lot better than 40 yard field goals
6503510 but he has the ability to make them from that far
6503511 matt has the strongest leg sometimes hes the most accurate
6503512 he hit a little slump about two weeks ago part of that is probably me we hadnt settled on a short snapper for extra points and field goals and now weve settled on that its going to be jake byrne everybody talks about the kickers on the field goal but that snapper is awfully important i think hes lucky in that his holder is the same guy from high school matt perrelli
6503513 if you look at him last year after three or four games everyone thought it was going to be a nightmare
6503514 but as the year progressed he got better and it was just like if you or me and went out there and started something new wed make a lot of mistakes early as he became more comfortable i thought he became pretty good i thought when we played virginia tech he held them down pretty good eddie royal was as good a punt returner as ive played against and he did a great job holding him down

6503517 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail

6503519 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6503520 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6503521 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6503522 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6503523 its a whole series of things that are not very important theyve got important sounding titles but reality of that nato russia council is they look for things to talk about

6503533 that riskay chick wanted to smell my dick and i was like nuh uh girlfriend cuz i might swell up yo eyes
6503534 it seems as if she came out of nowhere and she has drawn mega attention across the globe from it
6503535 dude san she has mega attention teh globe knows this
6503536 however riskay will be the first to tell you that she has paid her dues in this game just the same as many other artists that has acquired success
6503537 she has achieved the unimaginable as an independent artist from florida that lacked the finances and major support of major players in the music industry to cosign her despite this she hasnt given up and she encourages work for what they want despite their circumstances
6503538 from the sound of her songs and the very explicit provocative lyrics describing cheating in relationships and comparing passion and intimacy to the likes of drug addiction most critics first impression is to sit back astonished by her words in shock and wonder
6503539 i am not afraid to take risks and try something at least once to say i did it and take a chance to get the job done but there is a line that i will never cross
6503540 the name riskay and the risks refer only to my music and my dedication to hard work
6503541 great work riskay you have busted your ass for months for that account
6503542 never indecisive as she explains why she is known as the the drama queen
6503543 i no longer will be known as eminem which means m and m for marshall mathers but now it will means little colored candies thank you riskay the drama queen for opening my eyes
6503544 riskay was born and raised in bartow florida and has been rapping for six years

6503562 i am sick and tired of the president of the united states embarrassing me the world we live in is too complex to entrust it to someone else whose idea of intellectual curiosity and grasp of foreign policy issues is to tell us he can look into vladimir putins eyes and see into his soul george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him

6503585 more adaptations than not turn out badly there are a few that are amazing but most of the time its not a good thing but then on the other side i saw the book very visually when i was writing it and to see one scene of it on the big screen that was alluring i didnt care about anyone else going to see it that was about me alone in the theater getting to see it and having it be real thats what swayed me
6503586 as an author you cant try to control that kind of project

6503676 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong

6503690 because of the economic condition we did not have to be as promotional on the buy side of games because it just seems like we were naturally getting consumers trading games in

6503714 i had told him not to and when i asked why he did it he said he just couldnt resist
6503715 ive seen plenty of disgusted and disgruntled parents come in with phone bills in the hundreds of dollars for their kids
6503716 and then theres the fact that kids will be kids they play rough with and lose their toys a phone will be no different
6503717 theres a huge difference between feeling safer and being safer
6503718 a cell phone is with the person who controls it and most parents dont check cell phones
6503719 we do not have enough information nor do we have enough time to be sure that cell phones are safe and theres reason for concern that they may be harmful
6503720 i was so busy with school and sports that i rarely used the phone
6503721 its just like anything else and you have to monitor it
6503722 and the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself there is no other commandment greater than these
6503723 any significant accomplishment in a kids life is really at risk unless he or she has a good relationship with dad
6503724 if a child has a positive experience with a dad during those early years he learns a lot about trust and love
6503725 he figures out who he is by watching his fathers responses to him this interaction can shape the entire course of his life
6503726 boys have a need to be able to size up their masculinity
6503727 if they dont have that dad influence they never feel theyre good enough or strong enough
6503728 a daughter is born with a desire to want to please her dad and get positive attention from him
6503729 the number one way to increase a girls self esteem is for her dad to give her attention many girls who dont get that from their dads seek it out in relationships with boys
6503730 it left a pretty big hole in my heart and made me want to find a father
6503731 when i became a teenager i had this insatiable need to be recognized by boys i constantly needed attention that way i didnt realize it at the time but i was looking for a dad
6503732 i was healed at that moment in terms of needing that daddy but it took years of trying to get whole
6503733 im 41 years old and still being healed of some of the wounds of the past
6503734 the father puts a template over a childs heart for how he or she is going to relate to men and male figures for life
6503735 its the open or the closed door to god the father so its an extremely important relationship
6503736 they are not second class moms or good helpers fathers play a distinctive and important role as providers protectors disciplinarians and playmates in the average american home children identify with and look up to their real father in a way that they wont with other men and they typically do not view their mothers in the same way that they view their fathers
6503737 we cant pretend that kids dont need a masculine influence
6503738 but single moms can find comfort in knowing god is the perfect father and surrendering that dad portion of the equation to the lord they also need to ask god to show them other men in the childs life who could be a solid role model for them
6503739 i will praise the lord who counsels me you have made known to me the path of life you will fill me with joy in your presence with eternal pleasures at your right hand
6503740 heal my inner self for i have sinned against you
6503741 you have set our iniquities before you our secret sins in the light of your presence
6503742 the holy light of god that illumines the hidden corners of the heart and exposes its dark secrets
6503743 how we will set our hearts at rest in his presence
6503744 it was us angrily railing against bad comics i couldnt get away with that now
6503745 no were going to berlin tonight and i wanted to give it to a friend

6503758 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6503759 its a whole series of things that are not very important theyve got important sounding titles but reality of that nato russia council is they look for things to talk about

6503794 proposed u s withdrawal plan is right out of caps strategic redeployment plan
6503795 this highlights two growing trends within the region one being a growing interest in advertising plays that capitalize on indias emerging infrastructure and growing internet usage the other being an increase in second round deals which is expected as vcs are helping their portfolio companies expand and steering them toward liquidity
6503796 i went to the first hour student government class which is all student council members and we walk in kind of excited about the first day and we found out the first job assignment by our principal is to pick up the pranks from the senior 2009 class it was just kind of picking up wet toilet paper and putting it into a garbage can

6503805 the conventions provide a big national spotlight for both candidates a chance to have the stage when voters are actually paying attention
6503806 it is an incredible opportunity to tell the american people your vision for the country and what you will do as president and that can change the dynamics of the race
6503807 they are finished with just telling voters about themselves now they have to show voters they are ready to be president
6503808 there is definitely going to be a contrast drawn between the two candidates
6503809 this convention will make the choice crystal clear between two very different approaches to leadership
6503810 the real open question is what is he going to do he has to take that question head on in this convention and make it clear in an unequivocal way what the two or three priorities for his candidacy are
6503811 i dont think americans have a clear sense of what his plan for the american economy is that is something they can fix at the convention and they need to do that
6503812 obama is cotton candy it tastes great but you cant live on it mccain is meat and potatoes

6503829 everything has been agreed with abdoulaye in fact it was all agreed at the back end of last week
6503830 unfortunately the work permit situation isnt as straightforward because he hasnt played the requisite number of games for the application to go straight through
6503831 however having gone through it with abdoulaye the reason he hasnt played the games is because he has been injured
6503832 we have been in constant contact with the home office and we have got an agreement with them that providing we can prove he wasnt selected because he was injured then they will approve that work permit application
6503833 what we require from that to put it simply is a certification from the international team doctor that he was not fit or available for selection in those games

6503867 the bnp deny the holocaust sic where thousands of lgbt lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people trade unionists and disabled people were slaughtered
6503868 we feel it is an extremely serious oversight when referring to the victims of the holocaust not to include the six million jewish people who perished under the nazi regime
6503869 while there were many victims of the holocaust it was only the jews and the roma people who were singled out for extermination neither was mentioned in this leaflet

6503921 first thing id do as president is to go to see the speaker of the house and the majority leader of the senate i assume that that would be sen reid i hope not but i think thats probably the reality of this election and i would say lets have an agenda lets work together we know what the solutions are and we know what the options are social security on restraining spending on medicare on all of these energy independence on all of these issues
6503922 lets show the american people that there are opportunities for us to work together for the good of the country

6503949 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6503950 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6503951 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6503952 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6503953 he was a tough negotiator but always reasonable and respectful with the ultimate goal of growing the game
6503954 the point where they hit you youve realized youve really crossed that line
6503955 her table got up to leave and i said im just going to take my act out with you into the street because now youve ruined it and now youre going to hear it all the way home
6503956 i started to follow them out of the club and this woman turned around and started choking me i just started laughing
6503957 i never felt that way about little rock i love little rock ive wanted to tour through the south ive thought about that a lot
6503958 from being picked on or being unpopular or compensating for not being good looking and athletic so i got into punk music or weird comedy like monty python or andy kaufman which just blew me away as a kid
6503959 i wasnt nearly as much in control and didnt have as much responsibility with ucb as i do now as an executive producer
6503960 we had to have a whole system and figure out how to do that and that was one of the hardest parts of the show
6503961 at least half if not more i completely agree with their point of view on life and what they said when they were on the show
6503962 that doesnt put them beyond being made fun of i think its kind of dangerous how experts argue for an entire point of view theyre all mr know it alls as am i we all deserve to get held up for scrutiny and taken down a peg every once in a while
6503963 we didnt get any advertising for the show at all and nevertheless weve gotten pretty good ratings and they keep improving too
6503964 the gag isnt hey we fooled you thats what a hidden camera show is i hate it when they do that they always look guilty
6503965 they always look like they splooged in a persons hair hey man sorry oh you were a good sport ha ha ha they just seem corny it seems like theyre selling out the very bit they just did people who get pranked should deserve to get pranked we were inviting them into a debate and debates what they got
6503966 i completely agree with my character and everything i said
6503967 nothing gives you a feeling of power even though its not real than a gun because it can kill people it can take away a life and its not something to be underestimated i do believe that there are sexual issues tied up in all that not for every single gun owner but for a lot
6503968 lets not confuse me and the show the show is definitely reflective of things i believe but its also reflective of the other actors the other creator and the other writers believe i wouldnt speak for everyone i myself am a democrat and have always voted democrat and a fan of bill and hillary clinton i think he is the greatest president weve had in our lifetime without question
6503969 there was a man named jonathan swift have you ever heard of him he wrote something called what was it called
6503970 a modest proposal and when he wrote it he didnt start off that piece by saying what im about to write is a joke i think he didnt care that they didnt get it was a joke im not speaking for him ive never talked to him personally i think hes dead i think he probably wouldnt even have liked the people that didnt get his joke
6503971 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands odi squad for after careful consideration
6503972 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6503973 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6503974 it would be lovely to have him coming in first change with the white ball but you dont always get what you want in life
6503975 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room
6503976 with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this upcoming series then im happy to do just that
6503977 at the moment my focus is on doing well in the odis against south africa and im not looking beyond that at this stage
6503978 im good friends with producer director paul bernard and he wants to turn me into an actor when im done with hockey
6503979 he and his brother tom are big producers in los angeles
6503980 theres a lot of waiting and reshooting on the set when its all said and done its pretty cool
6503981 im pretty proud thats the first scene of the series opener
6503982 i play a security guard who gets duped by a woman i have five six or seven lines
6503983 the tricky part is finding the right roles and to look natural youve got to get the mannerisms and facial expressions down if youre too stiff youre not believable the best actors are the most believable they completely change their personality my role is smaller but its still difficult
6503984 whatever happed to that guy broderick that you wrote about several times
6503985 hey its been a while since i last talked to you so i wanted to tell you thank you
6503986 this is broderick x jones former gang leader well its been four years since i was released from prison and im still standing strong im still in a loving marriage a follower of minister louis farrakhan drug free alcohol cigarettes etc

6503988 the pakistani army absolutely understands its priority is not india but is internal
6503989 some of the thinking in the army is in accordance with what petraeus has done in iraq
6503990 they see the need for quick impact projects such as those funded by u s army commanders in troubled iraqi districts
6503991 our home looks like a dormitory now because so many relatives have arrived
6503992 we dont have enough space in our three rooms but its our duty to receive them
6503993 azerbaijan recognizes georgias territorial integrity and believes that the conflict must be settled within the framework of international law
6503994 armenia is very concerned about the situation in south ossetia and expresses hopes that the parties will make efforts to settle the issues under dispute peacefully as soon as possible
6503995 i think that this position can be explained by the president of azerbaijans commitment to good relations with the leadership of russia and his wish to preserve stability in the country on the eve of the forthcoming presidential elections
6503996 its obvious that russia shouldnt be driven crazy because we have seen the consequences
6503997 the conflict between georgia and ossetia will definitely have an impact on the karabakh conflict
6503998 i am aware the bomb squad has responded to marlborough district courthouse
6503999 you could get into the parking lot but they wouldnt let you into the building

6504013 matt what would you like to see if you came to rvanews com
6504014 there i was with kids from all over the world
6504015 i think there were thirteen countries represented and literally every state i grew up more quickly became more responsible it was just a good experience reflecting back i felt like coming to wabash that i had already had a lot of the life experience that a lot of my colleagues were getting i didnt feel like i was on the same life trajectory
6504016 i felt like i had lots of good ideas my managers didnt have the same ideas or they didnt see the same opportunities that i did i wasnt at a place hierarchically in the company or skill wise where i could really affect change the way i wanted so i started thinking about business school it just made sense i just got to a point where it was the right time for me to reinvent my career and an mba helped me do that
6504017 we have an operations team we have an engineering team i work directly with each of those organizations to sell them on the opportunity and also get their buy in and support because we have to get resources and people from their teams to do the work and then once they buy off its a matter of meeting with these people in these teams on a regular basis and keeping them motivated so its just a continuous process
6504018 i think a liberal arts education is a good way to go
6504019 you have a better chance to be well rounded well versed in different things you get a different perspective in religion and culture and all those things and i think it makes you more well rounded more open to different things going on in the world

6504035 calculus was easy everyone else thought it was really difficult and stupid but i found it easy id get a thrill from finding the right answer its obvious to me now my recipes are just a form of calculus you take ingredients a and b and turn them into x i dont think ill tell my chefs that they might think im a nerd and not the great artiste
6504036 i first acted in a play at kindergarten i was a tree but i was the best tree ever my parents adored my acting always encouraging me in fact they wanted me to continue through drama school and everything i think they thought i would be a movie star i did try for a while when i went to university but i never had any money after uni i joined a local drama club met my wife and we soon had our first child so i left the acting world and joined a local bank great prospects regular wages and a subsidised mortgage i suppose that a coo is rather like a director in a play making sure that the right people are in the right place at the right time with the right script brilliant

6504041 instead of tearing the ticket they were taking the whole ticket getting several of them taking them back to the guy at the booth
6504042 next person would come in and pay for the ticket again and they would pocket the money
6504043 we pay our fair share to get in the gate everyone else does too and all that does is drive price up because they are going to have to make up for it somehow
6504044 you are thinking is going to go where its supposed to go but then it ends up in someone elses pocked

6504061 cutting down trees in a sustainable harvested forest which is what we draw our supply from is just like taking out corn or flowers and replanting them next year
6504062 from the hotels perspective this fits in very well with our recycling efforts our energy conservation
6504063 its something that is more sustainable than a typical plastic key we think its a great idea
6504064 the georgetown university hotel amp conference center exemplifies aramarks continued commitment to provide higher education institutions with innovative learning and leisure environments
6504065 its conference center facilities combined with an ideal location on the campus of one of the nations most elite higher education institutions provide the perfect backdrop for both leisure and business guests
6504066 hvordan kan det v re at mor gr der s dan uden at der er en grund til det
6504067 alle kvinder gr der nogen gange uden at der er en grund til det
6504068 da jeg skabte kvinden skulle hun v re noget s rligt jeg gjorde hendes skuldre st rke nok til at b re verdens byrder og dog blide nok til at kunne yde tr st
6504069 jeg gav hende indre styrke til at kunne udholde at f de b rn og til at
6504070 jeg gav hende en h rdhed der tillader hende at forts tte n r alle andre
6504071 jeg gav hende f lsomheden til ubetinget at elske sine b rn
6504072 jeg gav hende styrke til at kunne lede sin gtemand gennem hans mangler og
6504073 jeg gav hende kundskab til at vide at en god gtemand aldrig g r sin
6504074 og endelig gav jeg hende en t re hun kunne f lde

6504079 republic of ireland assistant team manager liam brady remains in a stable and comfortable condition in the coronary care unit of beaumont hospital
6504080 he was admitted there following an episode of back and chest pain this morning his condition is stable and his medical investigations are ongoing
6504081 the orbitofrontal cortex ofc is the main modulator of amygdala action
6504082 so if you are at a party and someone insults you the amygdala which is a very primitive and old structure in human brains will be yelling kill the guy
6504083 women excel in something called verbal fluency or being able to come up with appropriate words given cues
6504084 so we think that this kind of biomarker could be used in a rapid and noninvasive way to detect skin cancer
6504085 and this would be novel because now the only way to do so is with a visual exam and a biopsy which is of course invasive
6504086 because when youre dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you dont want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesnt get treated and you dont want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so its really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed

6504093 i will honestly miss them and will certainly be coming back to visit
6504094 in the short time ive been here weve actually been able to do a couple things
6504095 i had a lot of fun here the seniors here are wonderful
6504096 i think moving out to the park district makes a lot of sense
6504097 they already have seniors coming there maybe we could be helping more seniors if we were housed over there
6504098 there would be a lot more programs i would like to bring
6504099 but you cant have all programs going when you only have three rooms to do it
6504100 twenty three years ago municipalities did not have free standing senior centers
6504101 they were really innovative for their time theyve continued to support that
6504102 we are a central place a one stop shop where the seniors can come and get their art classes and information on medicare
6504103 the population of older people is just going to continue to grow
6504104 the need is just more and more for services like this
6504105 ninety five percent of dog owners are responsible but its because of the rest that we are having to consider these restrictions
6504106 when youre sitting in an area thats right in the middle of what we used to call the state of miami we now call it florida atlantic territory you ought to be able to recruit very good football players and if you can recruit very good football players what would keep you from being great

6504110 maggie udall and i will keep bob maureen and their family very close in our thoughts today our prayers will be with maureen for a successful surgery and a speedy recovery
6504111 you ruined my day i thought you were going to say she was the vice presidential nominee

6504115 there has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the nixon tapes and the pentagon papers
6504116 this is the declassification of what went on in secret behind the scenes
6504117 takes readers deep inside the white house the pentagon the state department the intelligence agencies and the u s military headquarters in iraq
6504118 based on extensive interviews with participants contemporaneous notes and secret documents the book traces the internal debates tensions and critical turning points in the iraq war during an extraordinary two year period
6504119 libraries are facing competition from television magazines the internet e books yet they have this archaic and mad idea of charging people money for being slightly late
6504120 its all so negative unprofessional and unbusinesslike like any business libraries need not to alienate their customers
6504121 my personal view is that theyre past their sell by date because they do sustain a very old fashioned image of libraries which is out of sync with todays modern library environment and the image libraries are trying to project tolerant responsive flexible stimulating
6504122 no one would argue against a parking or speeding fine if we didnt have speeding fines it wouldnt mean that people behaved better on the roads
6504123 were 101 in the country last year in total defense so weve got a long way to go to get to that no 1 and we want to continue to make sure that we get ourselves there
6504124 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6504125 hallmarks business unit reviewed it today and did all agree that it was in poor judgment to include the card in the line
6504126 we are stopping the shipping of the card and we will not produce it again hallmarks intent is never to offend and were truly sorry if that is the case here
6504127 global demand for all types of energy has risen steeply and supplies of finite resources like oil and gas are under intense pressure
6504128 the world is experiencing an energy shock of a kind not seen since the early 1970s but which is likely to have more profound and lasting consequences this is what lies behind much of the dramatic increase in wholesale energy prices we have experienced
6504129 i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6504130 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6504131 news of a key gas pipeline being shut and wholesale gas prices increasing as a result does not augur well for consumers
6504132 consumers are going to have to adjust quickly and there are two key steps to this making sure we pay the lowest possible price for our energy and learning to use less of it
6504133 why dont you park your car in the garage like our hoa requires us to instead of parking in your driveway

6504142 daarnaast houden we er ernstig rekening mee dat er als gevolg van de hoge kerosineprijzen en de wereldwijde verslechtering van het economische klimaat in 2009 opnieuw geen groei van het aantal passagiers zal zijn

6504147 an israeli attack on iran will most likely lead to great carnage strengthen the iranian regime throw iraq back into the worst chaos
6504148 socialists should not want and cannot support israel making a precipitate strike at iranian nuclear capacity
6504149 the inalienable right of every state to have nuclear weapons
6504150 we oppose both military action whether invasion or air strikes bombing raids etc and economic sanctions against iran
6504151 our basic slogans for now are no to war no to the islamic republic solidarity with iranian workers in the event of war our line would be similar i e a third camp one
6504152 we oppose attempts by the iranian government to develop nuclear weapons we want the labour movement to fight for unilateral disarmament by all nuclear weapons states that should not prevent us from acknowledging however that the prospect of the islamic republic developing a bomb is particularly alarming
6504153 a state whose clerical fascist rulers might see a nuclear armageddon involving a retaliatory israeli strike against iran in the way a god crazed suicide bomber sees blowing himself to pieces
6504154 a world where the workers of israel iran iraq were united in opposition to all their rulers and strong enough to get rid of them
6504155 a total of 3 000 centrifuges is the commonly accepted figure for a nuclear enrichment program that is past the experimental stage and can be used as a platform for a full industrial scale program that could churn out enough enriched material for dozens of nuclear weapons iran says it plans to move toward large scale uranium enrichment that will ultimately involve 54 000 centrifuges
6504156 we do not worship iran we worship allah for patriotism is another name for paganism i say let this land iran burn i say let this land go up in smoke provided islam emerges triumphant in the rest of the world
6504157 if a day comes when the world of islam is duly equipped with the arms israel has in possession application of an atomic bomb would not leave anything in israel but the same thing would just produce damages in the muslim world

6504170 its not unlike our holy father pope john paul ii when he came down with his disease he wanted people to see there was no shame or sorrow in struggling with the physical disease for spiritual reasons and i think catherines probably doing the same thing

6504175 who said that the cabinet has given the okay to hezbollah to carry out any action against israel
6504176 major efforts and there have been no complaints against hezbollah
6504177 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hezbollah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hezbollah
6504178 during the second lebanese war we considered the possibility of attacking lebanons infrastructure but we never resorted to this option because we thought at the time that not all the lebanese were responsible for the hezbollah attacks
6504179 im so impressed with the work that youre doing and the information youre disseminating its just vital for people to get this sort of information
6504180 mike adams has one of the best websites on the internet his articles podcasts and books will improve your life and possibly save it
6504181 whats the big deal it was only 5 calories difference
6504182 the maximum heart rate is theoretically the most times that your heart can safely beat in the span of one minute the traditional formula for computing maximum heart rate is 220 age i am 29 so my maximum heart rate would be computed at 191 beats per minute as you can see maximum heart rate will decrease with age
6504183 and even if it is right it may be that the most efficient fat burning regime isnt the one that will burn the most total calories of fat for a given period of time
6504184 gradually came about that the present age handed over the workers each alone and defenseless to the inhumanity of employers and the unbridled greed of competitors so that a very few rich and exceedingly rich men have laid a yoke almost of slavery on the unnumbered masses of non owning workers
6504185 with no change in the amount or character of capital goods
6504186 a labour system can be right in the sense of being intrinsically true and also morally legitimate if in its very basis it overcomes the opposition between labour and capital
6504187 nitrogen is very slippery its very difficult to keep it on land
6504188 we need to find a technology to keep nitrogen from leaving the soil
6504189 its a big economic benefit for farmers if they use only half as much nitrogen as well a big beneficial impact on nitrogen runoff into waterways
6504190 a reasonable expectation is that there would be a dramatic reduction maybe by 2018

6504195 we have to raise prices because of substantial increments in costs of raw materials like steel sheets and plastic resin
6504196 consumers in malaysia are increasingly choosing quality and reliable household appliance over low cost makes
6504197 political stability is important and that translates into consistency in business policies

6504199 our aim is to become a preferred engineering company for oil and gas and petrochemicals in the region
6504200 of this 15 20 per cent are onshore jobs and the rest offshore
6504201 the current price level is not a big concern for us and we remain confident in our outlook
6504202 twelve months ago the price was rm2 000 per tonne and yet we had a good year so at rm2 400 per tonne we are still good
6504203 we also expect the oil extraction rate of 21 per cent to be maintained
6504204 this is based on the cpo price as it was roughly rm2 000 per tonne for the first quarter ended june 30 2007 but it has since gone up during our current first quarter period so we will definitely do better
6504205 but it will be over a staggered basis because were not going to develop in one go we have spent less than rm50 million so far for the land acquisition
6504206 but in december and january that is when the monsoon hits so yields will start tapering off
6504207 we expect the market to respond if you look at the trend when crop goes up the price goes up
6504208 we have to raise prices because of substantial increments in costs of raw materials like steel sheets and plastic resin

6504214 the chinese army again fired on a crowd on monday august 18 in the kham region in eastern tibet
6504215 he clearly stated that we had no specific information on the number of casualties
6504216 we have been told that there have been casualties but we are not able to verify what casualties means whether people have been killed or whether they have been injured
6504217 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of the tibetan capital lhasa alone
6504218 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6504219 ten thousand people have been arrested we dont know where they are imprisoned
6504220 a project of long term brutal repression is under way
6504221 but we were quickly disillusioned our envoys came up against a wall there was no opening
6504222 real autonomy because we know what chinese style autonomy is a trap
6504223 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6504224 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6504225 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6504226 there is a real need for strengthening the capacity of countries particularly in africa in coping with such climate shocks
6504227 the negotiations need to speed up and become more concrete if governments are to meet the deadline they set for themselves
6504228 there has been no single country that has spoken against

6504238 third point at least had nothing to do with bears demise the fund put on a large short bet on bear stearns in the summer of 2007 when the stock was in the triple digits and even reduced its prime brokerage exposure to the firm but after making a nice profit third point covered its bear trade later that year before the collapse that saw shareholders get just 10 a share for a stock that a year earlier was fetching 170

6504246 i dont see a polished active directory implementation for linux built by novell that leverages anything samba is doing
6504247 there is a huge problem especially that we have a new president whose approach to government has question marks the president due to his popularity has become an institution within the state he has become too powerful and if that power was to be shared it would work well for the country but due to mistrust of intellectuals we might see a lot of intellectuals being marginalised
6504248 there are capable people like dr monageng mogalakwe a sociologist who could have been co opted into the committee to meaningfully contribute in its work
6504249 the new leader is imposing directives even if intellectuals try to engage government departments it will be difficult because critical thinking is not encouraged
6504250 we need to talk about how we can work together to make our country a success when you are critical of government you are labelled a politician but what i know is that university empowers its lecturers and students to critically assess issues constructively we are not being listened to because we are seen as against the system we should apply ourselves tactfully and not succumb to government attitude because we have to pay back the nation for educating us

6504252 this is the first industrial demonstration of a green technology for treating nuclear waste in a profitable way
6504253 out of this 30 tons they can recover approximately 6 million of enriched uranium
6504254 this amount of money is enough to build a plant for this new process

6504261 i think he should show more respect shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones
6504262 i would love him to show more respect to his competitors he should learn that he should shake hands with competitors
6504263 i understand the joy he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived is catch me if you can you dont do that
6504264 he was just enthusiastic very happy and there was never any animosity it was from within
6504265 i think if you look back at past athletes who did some of the things that they did its totally different

6504275 there is a lot difference its the tiny things the minute details
6504276 people who understand the game know that managers sometimes come in there is a big blitz of goals and then it fades away
6504277 what we have done is the right way slowly we are getting better
6504278 we are going up and down a little bit but were going in the right direction
6504279 its in place now weve got the coach the captain the vice captain now we can start moving forward
6504280 we have got the cobwebs out of the way back into the england mind set
6504281 we have got to go away and there are some important games for our clubs but we are set for england now
6504282 i think maybe we underestimated them in the last campaign and we paid the price
6504283 its difficult to talk about revenge or anything like that in football but it is fresh in our minds what they have done to us their celebrations and things like that so we want to go and win the game
6504284 there was a lot of good movement a lot of good passing at times but again we still feel theres room for improvement
6504285 we are all talking every day the players are talking with each other about how we can improve we want to get things right
6504286 if we had won 5 0 people would be talking about us being world champions if we had have lost 5 0 we would be the biggest duffers ever to kick a ball
6504287 managing expectations is not something we are in control of
6504288 we have just got to do what we can control and that is our performances patience is the key it is an 18 month campaign
6504289 obviously we are making steps small strides and they might not be noticeable to the public but we are feeling them as a team and we are getting stronger
6504290 it is all about qualifying first and foremost then we want to be peaking when we get there

6504406 georgia has no other choice people have understood that if it is georgia today attacked by russian forces then tomorrow it could be poland or the czech republic
6504407 georgia was a russian colony for more than 200 years but this is the 21st century the time for colonies is over georgia now has the strong support of the outside world
6504408 the lands of south ossetia and abkhazia are our georgian land the demands of our people for their return are legitimate
6504409 i appeal to russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister vladimir putin to immediately end the occupation of georgia and to take their forces off its territory

6504423 we heard a loud bang and my wife said to me theres a car in the pool and i couldnt believe it i was pretty surprised how can there be a car in the pool i looked out and there was a lot of blue lights so i knew something was happening then i looked out and really did see a car in the pool
6504424 and then im not sure the percentage last year i was too upset to look and now theyre predicting theres going to be a 40 60 increase again this winter
6504425 the ailing economy poses a serious threat to our schools and colleges and unless we act now to protect funding for education the states future will be bleak still the hyper partisan political environment at the state capitol is toxic the first priority seems to be to repudiate damage or block any proposal or position of the other party the second priority is to push their own partys proposals and positions in unaltered form the far distant third priority to be avoided if at all possible seems to be addressing any genuine state need that requires compromise all of this is pretty obvious to most wisconsinites in every corner of the state i hear complaints about partisanship from corporate executives average joes and everyone in between
6504426 wmc has evolved from being a strategically focused business organization to being a partisan political lobbying organization this combined with wmcs wealth and undeniable political influence and effectiveness has made wmc the single biggest driver of our toxic political environment and thus the single biggest obstacle to the recovery of wisconsins economy
6504427 im starting to hear it more and more why is wisconsin manufacturers amp commerce speaking for all businesses when its probably only speaking for a small portion of its membership
6504428 wmcs ideology is the ideology of the wmc board of directors and the wmc members the staff represents the members period the policy agenda was approved unanimously by the wmc board and the wmc board unanimously has recommended that wmc continue to engage in the political debate in our state

6504439 the minister asked the concerned countries to employ their ties with israel and international forums to urge it to stop taking any unilateral measure in jerusalem that could change its legal status including the planned construction of a bridge at magharebah gate
6504440 rejected such a unilateral step because it runs counter to the relevant un resolutions which consider east jerusalem an occupied city

6504451 the dark side the inside story of how the war on terror turned into a war on american ideals
6504452 these measures have already been used effectively on several occasions
6504453 we believe these measures together with the existing oversight system provide the graduated system needed to ensure that operators maintain the required standards
6504454 the commander did not immediately appreciate how far down the runway he had landed and delayed applying maximum braking until he saw the end of the runway
6504455 what id say is that theyre much more aggressive this fighting season than theyve been in the past
6504456 he was respected by his subordinates peers and superiors for his outstanding professionalism operational experience and his competence
6504457 a veteran soldier this was his third tour in afghanistan he was a devoted father who liked to share stories of his children with his colleagues and friends
6504458 the difference is theyre not holding any of the ground that they attack us on so in the case of an ied strike they will inflict some casualties but they dont control the road they inflicted the casualties on so really the net effect is zero other than it whittles away at our resolve
6504459 our soldiers believe in this mission they know what this is all about
6504460 at the end of the day the taliban are against things theyre not for anything theyre against human rights theyre against education theyre against health care theyre against women theyre just against human decency so if we leave these people if we leave the population of kandahar province in the hands of the taliban we just wont be performing our duty and our soldiers know that
6504461 they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission
6504462 as combat engineers they were proud resourceful and armed with technical knowledge they generously used in this mission to help the people of kandahar

6504466 now were almost facing calamity because were not careful with our spending
6504467 due to the unprecedented demand our inventories have been depleted
6504468 we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins
6504469 this whole thing started about the time the ruskies made their move
6504470 it may very well be that the usgovt is preparing for the real financial meltdown by hoarding all remaining gold flows
6504471 we are working diligently to build up our inventory and hope to resume sales shortly
6504472 if i dont have something to sell i lose business
6504473 the situation is strange and doesnt fit the normal supply amp demand economic model
6504474 this entire location is dedicated to facilitating the resale of premium kenworth and peterbilt used trucks from pfc customers all across the united states
6504475 thats how we can offer truck operators and their dealers hundreds of late model trucks from which to choose
6504476 when we do field research with customer fleets not only is it important to listen to what they tell you they need but also especially what they dont tell you
6504477 we have a team where all they do is go on customer visits and they are looking closely at everything no matter how small
6504478 maybe a switch on the dash needs to get relocated because the driver is stretching frequently to reach it the driver may not verbalize that this is an issue but it is and we need to note that
6504479 europes had a lot of experience with scr selective catalytic reduction technology to meet their emission standards and well be using it to meet 2010 rules here in the u s
6504480 the issue for us is adapting scr to fit how trucks operate in the u s for example the tanks holding the urea solution sprayed into the trucks exhaust stream to control nox oxides of nitrogen emissions is small in europe between five and 20 gallons well need a 25 to 40 gallon tank for trucks in north america because they operate over much longer distances
6504481 youre looking at going from a 250 gallon tank down to 200 gallons
6504482 in europe they let it freeze and allow the truck to operate until the liquid thaws
6504483 in the u s we think that wont be allowed that if the urea freezes the truck wont be allowed to operate so we are looking at ways to keep the urea in a liquid state as efficiently as possible
6504484 we are excited to add such a high caliber group of student athletes to the georgetown family
6504485 i have the utmost confidence that the eight men and eleven women will help us continue to succeed in the big east and on a national level
6504486 in fact relative to inflation workers in ontario and nova scotia are being paid less today than a year ago
6504487 in other words about two thirds of canadian workers live in provinces where inflation has equalled or exceeded nominal wage increases from july 2007 through july 2008
6504488 the bears on global growth and commodity prices will trumpet that july was the last hurrah for inflation
6504489 were not nearly as comforted by the past months drop in oil prices
6504490 if you dont drive dont have a mortgage payment and dont eat fresh produce youre in luck
6504491 lower gasoline prices suggest that headline inflation will pull up short of the bank of canadas earlier projection of four per cent plus inflation but a fast retreat in inflation is unlikely

6504493 a london council is to pilot policies based on a new theory of behavioural economics in a bid to tackle litter reduce carbon emissions and increase recycling rates it has emerged the london borough of barnet has been given a reported 100 000 by the department of communities and local government to try out new nudge economics policies
6504494 our plans include the possibility of adding collision avoidance to the system in the future
6504495 but this will require meritor wabco to fuse a second sensor such as a vision base camera or a second radar source to supply validation of the collision target because collision avoidance applies a much greater level of deceleration its critical that targets be properly identified before action is taken brakes are automatically applied
6504496 if a book about failures doesnt sell is it a success
6504497 you thought the sleeping giant was still sleeping well weve woken up and its time to take our message forward

6504502 the most amazing athletic performance ive ever seen in my life
6504503 hes an athlete who comes once every five or six athletic generations
6504504 in 1976 before i ran no one thought that i would break the world record break it four more times and be able to win for 10 years no one could have predicted that the times i ran 30 years ago could have won an olympic medal this week because when i was running those times everybody was 15 metres behind i was running by myself running 47 02 or 47 10 every now and then you have someone who is just that much better than everyone else i take myself as an example
6504505 people forget that at the 1976 olympics i was the only american to win a gold medal in a running event
6504506 it was just me we didnt win any gold medals in anything other than relays
6504507 all you have to do is look at a competition like the penn relays you and go back 30 years the jamaicans have been dominating
6504508 theyre producing the best athletes in the world they all used to go to the united states to go to college now theyre staying at home
6504509 i dont know what questions youre talking about i havent heard any
6504510 i am the person who tests in jamaica and i tested bolt 15 times between last november and december
6504511 since he has come here he has been tested six times anybody who wants to cast aspersions on our drug program i say go to hell
6504512 he bolt has got five years of experience that you guys didnt see
6504513 no one paid attention when he ran 20 1 at 17 years old
6504514 usain showed from a very early age he had the ability to be an outstanding 200 metre runner
6504515 i was surprised to see how well he was able to mesh in the 100 and after he set the world record in new york i felt like he could certainly break it in the 200
6504516 and so if im him the next on my list is the 400 because im sure he can run 43 seconds johnsons world record is 43 18
6504517 usain will run what he wants to when he wants to
6504518 now that usain has done this it might take us another 20 years to produce another athlete as outstanding as him but we will
6504519 because the seed has been sown now theres kids running around jamaica right now wanting to be usain bolt and its something were going to have to channel in the right manner so that we can maintain our position in the world in sprinting
6504520 the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer

6504627 not only do multiple heart events increase healthcare costs due to additional hospitalizations tests and physician visits but they also result in higher morbidity for many patients
6504628 this study demonstrates the potential for personalized medicine combining selection of patients with a specific type of genetic mutation and a drug treatment that has been specifically designed to overcome that mutation
6504629 the publication of these ground breaking results in the offers new hope to those patients with cf due to a nonsense mutation in the cftr gene and establishes a path forward for evaluating the efficacy and long term safety of ptc124
6504630 we are very pleased by this positive outcome from our ongoing collaboration with ptc
6504631 the development of ptc124 fits well with our strategic goal of supporting approaches that have the potential to modify the course of cf we are continuing to work together with ptc and the broader cf medical community to support the next steps in the evaluation of ptc124 for the clinical benefit for the treatment of nonsense mutation cf
6504632 the publication of these data provides clinical proof of concept in cf for the ptc124 mechanism of action in overcoming nonsense mutations as the basis for treating genetic disease
6504633 based on these results we intend to initiate a phase 2b study later this year to evaluate the clinical benefit of ptc124 in adults and children with nonsense mutation mediated cf given the potential applicability of ptc124 to multiple genetic disorders we have a pivotal study of ptc124 for nonsense mutation duchenne becker muscular dystrophy ongoing and are planning proof of concept studies in additional genetic disorders

6504644 so if you need a space a month away were happy to do that otherwise its difficult for us
6504645 for me i have to say that the mega stage is now my notre dame its my cathedral and i plan to worship there regularly
6504646 i wanted to do something special so i obtained and restored the very rare first film version of alice in wonderland made in england by cecil hepworth in 1903 this versatile director also plays frog in the film
6504647 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
6504648 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
6504649 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
6504650 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
6504651 this ruling will deny physicians and other professionals the ability to freely exercise their religious convictions
6504652 by forcing healthcare professionals to choose between conscience and career we will lose doctors nurses and other healthcare professionals who are already in short supply
6504653 this was really more a matter of timing than anything else
6504654 it was not an emergency situation these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
6504655 is about discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
6504656 the physicians in this case had determined to only provide reproductive services to married patients
6504657 this decision reaches beyond the medical profession taking away the first amendment rights of healthcare professionals puts at risk the rights of every working american
6504658 not every state has something like the california law that specifically protects people from discrimination and differential treatment based upon sexual orientation so it really is a rather unique situation nationally
6504659 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
6504660 weve also had a case in minneapolis in which muslim taxi drivers from somalia originally were refusing to pick up passengers from the airport who were disembarking with duty free alcohol because it violated their religious precepts that one should not drink alcohol so they would only agree to pick up passengers who agreed to leave the alcohol behind
6504661 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
6504662 from 1963 to 1990 they took the view that at least in theory it does give somebody the right to exemption
6504663 and trying to cop a feel she comments on daddys
6504664 but there is a gap between this understanding and the translation into action especially when it comes to united nations security council resolutions
6504665 it is my belief that russia has the best understanding about the situation about its own interest i do hope that not only russia but other states join not only the understanding of the need to stop iran but join more effective sanctions in order to do so
6504666 if there is no tension between russia and the west or the u s and russia there is a better chance to put pressure on iran
6504667 as tension increases between the u s and russia iran will benefit from it

6504673 a vaxfectin r formulated dna vaccine is a promising approach for the development of a new measles vaccine for young children
6504674 although a safe and effective live attenuated commercial measles vaccine is available measles continues to be a major cause of infant mortality
6504675 the immaturity of the immune system coupled with circulating maternal antibodies that interfere with the live attenuated vaccine severely limits vaccine effectiveness during an infants first year the juvenile and infant nonhuman primate studies provide encouragement that vaxfectin r formulated dna vaccination may be able to overcome these obstacles and may provide a viable alternative for infant immunization

6504680 lucas pee on the floor again next time you wanna pee tell mummy ok
6504681 i think a lot of delegates especially lgbt delegates are looking at how they can use the convention effectively
6504682 if we do this right we can really use this as an organizing convention
6504683 at every breakfast and caucus meeting well have a delegate in that room
6504684 one of the goals is not only to celebrate but to focus that we are the messengers of a pro equality message and send our message to our candidate
6504685 we view the republican national convention as an opportunity to engage in conversations with our fellow republican leaders
6504686 its by making our case and winning folks over to our side our community will achieve full equality
6504687 we have our unique issues around equal rights but we have the same concerns as the average american when it comes to health care education and the economy
6504688 i think its important that people see the lgbt community as no different in some sense
6504689 that something you can own and designate someone as your beneficiary
6504690 there are number of our issues that overlap broader issues in this country
6504691 has a lower profile but it will be an issue in peoples minds the bigger issues will be the economy terrorism health care energy
6504692 telling people to be afraid of marriage equality is a story thats played out and doesnt have the same fear factor it had in 2004
6504693 these wedge issues dont really work as well as people think they do for 2008 social issues will continue to be a part of the conversation but maybe not to the extent as they were in 2006 or 2004
6504694 the support for the amendment is really right wing groups and out of state right wing groups coming in to try to impose their views on californians
6504695 weve been heavily involved in it and continue to be theres a broad coalition of state groups were assisting them
6504696 as important as these issues are to lgbt people theyre not what drives voter behavior except for this tiny fraction of the electorate
6504697 conservatives and republicans have used it in the past and i dont see why they wont continue to try to use it its been effective theyre going to do as much as they can to divide the democrats and energize their base
6504698 i am supportive of obama and will vote for him but im also disappointed that democrats feel that were not at a point where we can be honest about what we truly feel is equal
6504699 the mainstream channels of political action move very slowly and the support obama is showing is considered radical to many people
6504700 im going back to my roots in leather and texture
6504701 were not going to renew it that shouldnt come as a surprise
6504702 we oppose discrimination i think weve got strong federal and state laws that protect our people
6504703 if people keep up to date on their prescriptions she doesnt care where they get their glasses filled and business has been good
6504704 but thats the only major disagreement weve had since she took office
6504705 she knew she would have to work with republicans when she came in and shes done pretty well doing that
6504706 the last time ireland had a similar squad which was the barcelona olympics we got a gold and a silver from michael carruth and wayne mccullough

6504717 the other night i was with a group of people and the fastest thing to do was to get on the bus some of these people had never been on a bus as if this was some awful low class way

6504724 here you can have this ring its a frog prince if you kiss one youll find your prince
6504725 there is so much negativity from the top down about how people look at our sport in ireland its sad because if you put myself or mark carroll in against any of the old guys we could have given them a go to the line
6504726 its true we live inside the atmosphere of the sun
6504727 if were going to live inside the suns atmosphere we need to learn more about it especially how to predict the storms
6504728 going to launch a fleet of weather stations spacecraft that observe different aspects of suns atmosphere
6504729 solar activity is a bit like a puppet show if you want to understand the motion of the puppets you need to see the strings on the sun the invisible strings are magnetic fields they penetrate the suns atmosphere guiding the flow of heat and orchestrating mighty explosions sdo will be able to produce detailed maps of magnetism on the sun revealing the strings for all to see
6504730 right now sdo is in a thermal vacuum chamber getting tested for the rough ride to space
6504731 no spacecraft has ever been as close to the sun as solar probe plus will go only 7 million km from the surface thats unexplored territory and we expect to learn a great deal about the suns atmosphere by going there
6504732 imagine trying to figure out earths climate by watching only one side of the planet impossible yet thats what weve been doing with the sun
6504733 weve just finished the science and technology definition team report which lays out the whole strategy for solar sentinels
6504734 theres no point in studying the sun if you dont understand what it does to earth
6504735 right now we have our hands full with the others
6504736 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6504737 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6504738 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6504739 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6504740 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6504741 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6504742 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6504743 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6504744 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6504745 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6504746 faced with a embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates a mccain campaign scrambled today scratch ralph reed from tonights program
6504747 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6504748 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6504749 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6504750 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6504751 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6504752 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6504753 hmmmm i can make a nice summer top from these
6504754 por las caracter sticas del accidente hay una gran cantidad de cad veres que resulta desde todo punto de vista imposible otro diagn stico que no sea por el adn que se ha hecho a todos incluso a aquellos que hemos podido identificar por huella dactilar
6504755 kill kidnap and cause bodily harm upon a major candidate for president of the united states that is senator barack obama
6504756 wanted to kill obama id just use a sniper rifle
6504757 a search of geisels vehicle and a hotel room in miami where geisel was attending a bail bondsman training class found a 9 mm handgun ammunition that included armor piercing and rifle bullets police style emergency lights body armor a machete and two canisters of tear gas among other military style items according to the document
6504758 that he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
6504759 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6504760 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6504761 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6504762 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6504763 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6504764 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6504765 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6504766 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6504767 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6504768 het grote voordeel van dit voor zwolle bijzondere complex is dat er geen bouwbelemmeringen bestaan er behoeft dus niet eerst een verkooppercentage gehaald te worden mensen die willen kopen kunnen er zeker van zijn dat hun appartement ook daadwerkelijk gebouwd gaat worden ze weten dus direct waar ze aan toe zijn
6504769 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class
6504770 its not the job of the government to define who is rich
6504771 the real fault lines are over how to treat people in the highest tax brackets it gets to the heart of their economic philosophies
6504772 science without religion is lame religion without science is blind a legitimate conflict between science and religion cannot exist
6504773 the word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses the bible a collection of honourable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish
6504774 for me the jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions
6504775 you clearly can be a scientist and have religious beliefs but i dont think you can be a real scientist in the deepest sense of the word because they are such alien categories of knowledge
6504776 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6504777 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6504778 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6504779 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6504780 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6504781 is building an open platform to connect teachers and students
6504782 this website is engineered to reach the youth of america and undoubtedly will be featured in their health curriculum that is in many of our public school systems
6504783 its been such a warm welcome that ive received over the past week
6504784 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6504785 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6504786 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6504787 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6504788 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6504789 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6504790 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6504791 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6504792 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6504793 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6504794 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6504795 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6504796 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6504797 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6504798 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6504799 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6504800 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6504801 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6504802 who are open to doing something on the production side
6504803 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6504804 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6504805 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6504806 i understand the joy he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6504807 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6504808 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6504809 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6504810 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6504811 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6504812 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

6504817 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6504818 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6504819 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6504820 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6504821 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6504822 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6504823 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6504824 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6504825 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6504826 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6504827 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6504828 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6504829 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6504830 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6504831 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6504832 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6504833 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6504834 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6504835 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6504836 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6504872 groping in the darkness for the springs of our incomprehensible machines
6504873 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6504874 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6504875 we need a plan for breaking up fannie and freddie and selling them to private investors so that the government isnt the biggest backer of the housing market
6504876 the government better get a heck of a good guy to run fannie and freddie
6504877 for all practical purposes fannie and freddie are nationalized but the government doesnt have enough control given its interest in the housing market
6504878 this process needs to be done in an overt rather than covert fashion so that market participants know what the rules are
6504879 if the government wants to provide a subsidy why not just give it directly to borrowers and get dollar for dollar on its money
6504880 of course the problem is that this would be a government program but its more efficient than the system we have now
6504881 this is when the market could effectively shut them down
6504882 it could cause total panic in the global financial system which is based on credit
6504883 some people say let them fail and let the market sort it out and the market will sort it out
6504884 but in the meantime that could mean the end of the market and the financial institutions and banks they tried that during the great depression the market will work but its a question of cost and the cost would be the collapse of the banking system
6504885 fannie and freddie are private institutions that had special privileges in the marketplace which forced competitors out of business
6504886 my experience in government says whenever possible the government shouldnt run it
6504887 but this is one of those times when the government has to run it
6504888 oil prices are going much further than they have already fallen

6504939 coincidimos con la organizaci n mundial de la salud oms en que no es necesario detener la irrigaci n con aguas residuales
6504940 hemos probado y verificado este enfoque su implementaci n sin embargo requiere cambios de conducta y un mercadeo social de la seguridad alimentaria como el que vemos en las campa as que promueven el lavado de las manos
6504941 la descarga incontrolada de aguas residuales est contaminando grandes vol menes de agua fresca

6504943 stop running around with carrots in your mouth or you are going to choke to death
6504944 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6504945 los talibanes son cada vez m s fuertes y tienen m s confianza
6504946 lanzan ataques cada vez m s complejos y en forma m s en rgica
6504947 ste es un problema regional sin cambios pol ticos en pakist n aun 200 000 soldados de la otan no ser n suficientes
6504948 la guerra contra el terrorismo no se libra en las aldeas de afganist n
6504949 el nico resultado de los ataques a reos es matar a civiles
6504950 en las t cticas y t cnicas usadas por los enemigos en nuestro sector vemos evidencias de una influencia extranjera
6504951 por eso es que se necesita una estrategia de contrainsurgencia no s lo en afganist n sino en toda la regi n
6504952 el dinero de la reconstrucci n se ha ido a los bolsillos equivocados y las organizaciones no gubernamentales y las autoridades son vistas como corruptas lo cual hace que algunas personas en las provincias se vuelvan a favor del talib n
6504953 el talib n controla los tribunales la polic a e incluso el gobierno del distrito
6504954 parece que la cpi usa al continente como un caso para realizar pruebas para determinar en qu manera el derecho internacional puede obtener m s legitimidad en el terreno
6504955 la cpi se concentra en la debilidad econ mica y pol tica de pa ses vulnerables y en naciones que no son capaces o no est n dispuestas a juzgar a perpetradores de cr menes contra la humanidad muchos pa ses africanos entran en este criterio
6504956 tenemos que preguntarnos si el castigo es un disuasivo suficiente para aquellos que violan los derechos humanos la intervenci n de la cpi es suficiente para detener cr menes contra la humanidad y cr menes de guerra en frica o en cualquier parte del mundo
6504957 el tribunal tendr a que hacer responsables a todos los tiranos pero esto no ocurre hasta ahora la mayor a de los acusados son africanos los poderosos como por ejemplo estados unidos nunca ser n llevados a juicio
6504958 rusia probablemente no ser juzgada por lo que est pasando en georgia y lo mismo pasa con china
6504959 debemos presentar un juicio contra el presidente zimbabwense robert mugabe a pesar de que esto podr a deteriorar aun m s la situaci n en zimbabwe o debemos darle la posibilidad de salir del gobierno lo cual contribuir a a una situaci n m s estable
6504960 no estoy muy en contra de esto ltimo pues traer a paz y estabilidad a zimbabwe
6504961 no es un experimento la cpi es permanente lleg para quedarse y no trata a ninguna parte del mundo como un experimento
6504962 el hecho es que frica jug un papel incre ble en la creaci n del tribunal
6504963 los casos que investiga la cpi en este momento fueron presentados por los propios estados parte excepto el de darfur que fue remitido por el consejo de seguridad de la onu por tanto no es verdad que el tribunal est concentrado solamente en frica pues la oficina del fiscal ha anunciado p blicamente que sigue de cerca la situaci n en otras partes del mundo por ejemplo en colombia y en afganist n
6504964 si alguien de un estado no parte comete cr menes contra la humanidad dentro del territorio de un estado miembro esta persona puede ser juzgada es posible
6504965 ik heb er een hekel aan als lingerie niet comfortabel zit pasvorm en comfort waren het uitgangspunt
6504966 ik zou het niet kunnen als ik er niet voor honderd procent voor ga
6504967 the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever that we may do all the words of this law
6504968 pressing this understanding of gods secret decree of unconditional election through the whole of scripture seems a prohibitively costly project since at every turn the words of scripture must then be read in ways most readers would never imagine
6504969 knowing that judah did not turn and listen the calvinist concludes that god had already chosen to withhold his transforming grace from them though he could easily have granted it so while the text appears to identify judahs pride as the root cause of punishment the calvinist instead concludes that judahs ability to repent depends on gods eternally fixed plan again although the text seems to identify salvation as gods deepest desire the calvinist must conclude that at a deeper level god never intended to bestow transforming grace on jeremiahs hearers in other words the true intentions of god cannot be discerned from his words
6504970 somewhere along the way the burden of reading myriad passages throughout the bible in such a counterintuitive fashion should anxiously bring us to this sort of question since the calvinist view of divine sovereignty routinely requires such an awkward decoding of biblical texts should not we re examine the calvinist view of divine sovereignty itself

6504981 something that hasnt been done before which is live electronic music but actually done live
6504982 so much of the other electronic stuff when its done live they might be playing from a sequencer or they might have most of their tracks playing from hard disks at the end of the day we dont really see that as live were recreating music with all the instruments
6504983 two years ago i would have never said that the euro trance sound would have worked but when you look at what timbaland has done incorporating that sound into his r amp b stuff its taken off i think if people get introduced to it the right way it could take off
6504984 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
6504985 it is not appropriate in my opinion to spend any funds that are not essential for service

6504996 alexs hometown of bridgend hit the press recently after a shocking spate of youth suicides
6504997 shes hoping that success today might provide some welcome good news for a town thats been living under a cloud
6504998 because of all the bad press that bridgend has been getting lately i just think that getting through would be the good bit of news that we need
6504999 they thought that up when i said i was from bridgend
6505000 the producers wanted me to talk about it but i didnt want to just in case i offended someones family
6505001 i would much rather be known for the talent than the girl that comes from the suicide town
6505002 alexandra gave a wide ranging interview about issues which were relevant important and personal to her which we accurately reflected in the programme
6505003 she talked openly and candidly about wanting to bring some good news back to her home town of bridgend
6505004 take the worst elements of cloverfield shaky camera and retarded talking and throw in blatant ads plus a hot girl stifled with sh1tty lines
6505005 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
6505006 higher oil prices and lack of fiscal policy reactions amidst high pent up price pressures are putting the burden of macro economic adjustment on monetary authorities as a result policy as well as market interest rates could rise and a sharp deceleration in growth may follow
6505007 future actions with respect to indias local currency rating will depend largely on whether the fy09 fiscal slippage is reversed which would allow for a resumption of the decline in indias high government debt ratios
6505008 investment has definitely come down during the last quarter in june about 15 per cent planned projects took off compared to a normal project commencement ratio of 30 per cent

6505015 you get different themes if you will and chuck writes a few songs and that brings in a different feel
6505016 but its still the same downchild sound people hear that sound and they know its us downchild has had the same sound since we started pretty lucky
6505017 let me put it this way im having a good time but i couldnt do what i did 25 or 30 years ago we were on the road all the time
6505018 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
6505019 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt

6505065 never never never believe any war will be smooth and easy or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter the statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events
6505066 the destruction of the islamic khilafah state over 80 years ago marked the beginning of dividing the muslim world into countless nation states governed by a plethora of kings dictators and western backed democrats today three major regions of the muslim world are under occupation palestine iraq and afghanistan oil and food crisis has pushed millions of people into starvation sectarian divisions are fuelled by occupying powers to further divide and weaken us the muslim ummah now needs a new political thinking and direction it requires a new leadership that will unify the umma and utilize her resources to address these countless problems this one day conference will address the obligation of unifying our umma under one leadership and discuss how political unity is the only practical way forward for the muslim ummah

6505068 we have repeatedly called on the government to act urgently to protect canadas freshwater and to close any possible loopholes that might threaten the sovereignty of canadian water resources
6505069 what weve got instead is a piecemeal approach which reflects the lack of concern that the conservatives have toward the environment
6505070 no wonder the conservatives are trying to keep all these scientific reports quiet this report also confirms what we said a year ago
6505071 the conservatives must stop ignoring this important issue and act now

6505116 in absehbarer zukunft wird es in ostdeutschland den ersten ministerpr sidenten der linkspartei geben das ergibt sich angesichts der kr fteverh ltnisse aus einer einfachen logik wenn die spd nicht pausenlos partner der cdu sein will muss sie auch die rolle als juniorpartner der linken akzeptieren

6505125 his thumbnails are so clear and detailed that we can go over every element then and i know the final result is going to be perfect hes a stickler for details on both the important things in a panel and the simple things like backgrounds and textures

6505186 it was surprising that brown fat is part of the muscle lineage

6505208 in making its decision microsoft recognized what we in iowa have known all along our work force and quality of life makes iowa the best place for business
6505209 i am absolutely committed to bringing high quality innovative jobs to iowa and with microsofts help were doing just that
6505210 microsoft has a very significant site selection process looking for the very best places in the world to locate our facilities
6505211 microsoft selected iowa after evaluating a number of locations across the country
6505212 iowa provided the best all around combination of attributes that we evaluate in an important selection such as this
6505213 iowa will be a key hub in that infrastructure moving forward
6505214 microsoft serves over 500 million unique users in its web properties every single month
6505215 there will be 500 million new people visiting iowa through the auspices of this data center

6505220 thats why this race is so close nationally despite the political environment totally going obamas way
6505221 the fact that this is a very close race nationally underscores the perceptual challenges that obama faces in terms of not being seen as a leader
6505222 what he had to do to win the nomination has lost him a great deal on the other hand obama does have important advantages on bringing the right kind of change restoring our respect in the world those are also important presidential attributes
6505223 toward the beginning of this thing i was thinking if a republican was going to win i wish it was him
6505224 he was probably the best candidate of all the choices that i had but after ive seen all this other stuff and his campaigning right now is bothersome too ive lost almost all my respect for him
6505225 when obama talks he doesnt really say what he stands for
6505226 comcast changed its story and admitted that it did target its subscribers peer to peer traffic for interference
6505227 the company initially claimed that it did so only during periods of peak network congestion and of heavy network traffic later confronted with yet more evidence suggesting that interference was not limited in this manner comcast recast its position yet again and admitted that it interferes with peer to peer traffic regardless of the level of overall network congestion at the time and regardless of the time of day

6505480 esperamos que se juzgue una l gica la l gica croma n donde se privilegia el negocio por sobre la vida y se cuida m s la propiedad que a las personas
6505481 este es un juicio incompleto nunca va a estar lo suficientemente completo porque el primero que deber a estar an bal ibarra fue sobrese do por razones pol ticas y porque la corporaci n judicial o al menos una parte sigui protegi ndolo

6505487 croma n es un mal ejemplo que se puede expandir hay una corporaci n judicial e incluyo en lo que digo a la corte suprema que tiene una concepci n aristocr tica del poder judicial ellos son los cortesanos y el pueblo son los s bditos pero resulta que los s bditos andan medio subversivos y hay que cuidarse de ellos que somos todos nosotros
6505488 todos hablan mucho pero en la pr ctica se hace poco aqu la consigna es adaptarse a lo que hay y callarse la boca

6505628 ive known bill for many years and i dont know of anybody else as strong as how can i put this bill is hmm is in my opinion the most influential sports person in this town
6505629 what hes done with the united states olympic committee and the national governing bodies and the support from el pomar to me bill is ahh you know bill is hes tops in my mind
6505630 he has been in a position to wield influence by virtue of his roles
6505631 but he has wielded it effectively into the huge benefit of all of the sports organizations in this town and its not just sports organizations it really extends all the way down into the entire populace
6505632 the fact of the matter is without bill hybl and his vision and support and commitment there is no colorado springs world arena there is no el pomar youth sports center and there are several ngbs national governing bodies who might not have had the wherewithal to be where they are or to have ever moved to colorado springs

6505636 ca at this stage hasnt made any official decision to not tour we are waiting to hear from icc the ball is in their court
6505637 we are very willing to tour pakistan we are very keen to do so and we will visit pakistan as long as the safety and security advisors say that it is safe
6505638 the only issue that is important for us is the safety and security of the players and the advice we get from our range of sources

6505650 lamore per la parola di dio e la santificazione della domenica rappresentano ora il testamento particolare del vescovo egger che ogni singolo fedele e le comunit parrocchiali serberanno cos che lincontro con il dio damore della rivelazione costituisca il centro della loro vita
6505651 un pastore tanto erudito quanto amabile e pio che instancabilmente ha portato alla gente la buona novella di cristo a lui affidata in modo particolare nellordinazione sacerdotale ed episcopale
6505652 ancora una settimana fa in occasione del mio congedo da bressanone ho potuto salutare
6505653 si assai prodigato per far s che potessi passare questanno le mie vacanze nello stupendo alto adige regione dove larte e la cultura si uniscono con la bont degli uomini in unarmonia meravigliosa
6505654 rapporto profondo con la sacra scrittura che ha totalmente pervaso e plasmato la sua vita so pure che la celebrazione delleucaristia costituiva il momento centrale della vita spirituale e che egli curava con profondo senso pastorale la santa messa domenicale con i fedeli della diocesi
6505655 il rapporto fondamentale con dio che deve sempre essere anche un rapporto fraterno col prossimo parte essenziale della vita
6505656 ben interpreta la vita di cristiano di religioso e di vescovo di questo generoso uomo di chiesa
6505657 preghiamo dio grande e misericordioso affinch voglia accogliere questo servo fedele nella sua casa e ammetterlo al banchetto della gioia eterna a tutti coloro che nella preghiera e nel sacrificio della messa fanno memoria del vescovo defunto imparto di cuore la confortatrice benedizione apostolica
6505658 la gente non nasconde un senso di vuoto e di smarrimento per questa morte improvvisa dice a

6505660 dopo aver ricevuto il dono del soggiorno di papa benedetto egli comunicava a tutti la sua gioia incontenibile come quella di un bambino abbracciandolo dopo langelus di domenica 10 agosto ho visto nel suo sguardo intenso riflettersi i sentimenti di tutto il popolo di questa splendida terra
6505661 turbamento non la parola definitiva per dire il peso che in questo momento opprime il nostro cuore
6505662 non unillusione consolatoria per esorcizzare langoscia della morte speranza certa di vita eterna di risurrezione che scaturisce dalla fede operosa che monsignor egger ci ha insegnato praticandola con chiara e avveduta consapevolezza
6505663 doveroso che vengano ripercorsi i tratti di tutto il suo ministero costantemente alimentato dallapprofondimento esistenziale della parola di dio e dallamorevole cura pastorale del popolo santo che gli stato affidato
6505664 signore chi ama la sua vita la perde e chi odia la sua vita in questo mondo la conserver per la vita eterna riusciremo a seguirti in questa impresa noi che ogni giorno facciamo di tutto per non perderla questa vita riusciremo a dedicarci ai nostri affetti matrimoniali e familiari a impegnarci nelleducazione dei nostri figli ad affrontare il lavoro con intenso equilibrio nella luce delleterna risurrezione che gi accoglie il nostro amato vescovo sapremo mostrare a tutti i nostri fratelli in ogni ambiente dellumana esistenza il volto di donne e uomini convinti per fede che la morte non ha pi potere su di loro lintensa relazione di comunione che fin da ora possiamo intrattenere con il vescovo wilhelm pregando per lui e chiedendo a lui di intercedere per noi una garanzia e un impegno
6505665 un uomo mite per formazione francescana capace di dialogo e di ascolto tessitore di riconciliazione ci ha fatto dono a piene mani della parola di dio e alla fine lultimo suo dono con il quale si accomiatato da noi stata la presenza del papa a bressanone lo ricordiamo raggiante accanto a benedetto xvi

6505804 they told us that randsco com had been hacked we sent each a thank you message and an explanation of events
6505805 while they have reversed the redirection and tighted overall server security theyre conducting a detailed post mortem on the event
6505806 we apologize to any of our visitors about the redirection
6505807 its very frustrating to be searching for relevant data and be directed away from that information to another website at best that website is a hard sell of marginal software at the very worse it could pose a security risk to our visitors personal computers if they downloaded the executable exe file
6505808 is that our regular readers those navigating to randsco com directly wouldnt be affected we know that this isnt much solace for the thousands of people attempting to find information at randsco via a search engine but you can rest assured that weve taken measures to prevent this kind of theft again

6505813 yes you can count on me to be true i do i do i do believe in me and i believe in you

6505829 uh huh just remember that until further notice ive met my perfect match
6505830 ive always had a policy of never saying what im going to do
6505831 ive been very flattered that a number of people have said mike you should try to change term limits and stay on but the bottom line is i have 497 days left to go
6505832 youd be derelict in your duties to ever say that i dont have any plans whatsoever to try to change term limits and stay on but im not going to go hypothetically and let you come up with anything in the whole world any mayor who did that would be derelict in their duty you have to be open to everything
6505833 the security agreement with the u s states iraq will not be used as launchpad for attacks against other countries
6505834 the agreement would be an excellent one if it is signed between baghdad and washington
6505835 we are pushing for a grand deal looking at the whole area
6505836 our aim is to draw up options by october which if all iraqi parties work consistently on those could provide a peaceful political solution which eventually may be confirmed or sanctioned through a confirmatory referendum
6505837 i told them it would have been totally counterproductive and there could be a better solution if we have a political framework
6505838 what is incredibly surprising in this whole exercise is what a mature and functioning bureaucracy iraq has had throughout the whole of its contemporary history

6505846 are you taping this call or should i talk slowly so you can take notes
6505847 let me be very very clear and please dont misrepresent me in your story that google is a partner and we dont see ourselves as a replacement for google but rather a complement for the following reasons
6505848 i spoke for 20 minutes about how were not replacing google and only mentioned why we might replace them for two minutes and they made that the title of the story
6505849 oh one more thing fella im a little confused you said your revenue model was e commerce but i dont see anything for sale on the site my wife she says im a little slow any chance you could explain that to me
6505850 google is our partner in five areas already search advertising analytics youtube open social and custom search they also send us half our traffic they are not our competition they are our partner
6505851 but youre human powered search and they are machine search if you reach scale some users will choose right if human powered search is that much better like you say folks will switch right
6505852 ive never really considered that they really are our partner and thats how we treat them
6505853 he may be president but he still comes home and swipes my socks

6505884 this vision to create a balance on the river between economic recreational and native american interests was both innovative and ambitious and i have followed this project closely
6505885 this is a remarkable model for how maine can maintain important hydropower generation on our rivers while taking the steps needed to restore our native sea run fisheries
6505886 today the penobscot is producing more power than ever before
6505887 just down the road in orono ppl maine is rebuilding the orono dam as part of this projects innovative approach to maintaining energy production in the end the company will maintain virtually all of their current capacity
6505888 in 2004 i pledged to seek state support for this project and for communities living along the river in 2006 i introduced a 5 million riverfront community development bond in maine
6505889 i am pleased to say the legislature and voters of maine embraced this first of its kind bond that will assist communities along rivers like the penobscot to revitalize their riverfronts

6505927 anyone with experience of legislation knows the massive temptation to pass more and more laws rather than concentrating on the effectiveness of the laws that have already been passed over the centuries every government and every legislature has been tempted in that direction
6505928 so lets not go there lets show that welsh elected representatives legislating for wales can resist that temptation
6505929 as the select committee says lets find ways of giving a proper focus to legislative work aimed at producing a reasonable number of high quality orders each year rather than allowing volume to swamp the system
6505930 and its practicalities that count improvement is always possible when i introduced the clean neighbourhoods act it was based largely on my constituency and local government experience in wales
6505931 they lcos do not need the same level of scrutiny as are accorded to acts of parliament or assembly measures because they do not change the law as these instruments do
6505932 what they do is to give powers to the assembly which can then lead to the sort of proper legislation that will have an impact on society and on peoples lives in the same way as alun michaels clean neighbourhoods act did
6505933 it is those subsequent measures that need the care and consideration that mr michael talks about not the legislative competence orders
6505934 nevertheless we should be grateful to alun michael for his views
6505935 in the meantime we do not need to be patronised by mps we are not children who are trying to run before we can walk we know what our capacity is for dealing with legislation we have got processes and support staff in place to make sure that we are thorough and practical in the measures we propose what we need is the range of powers necessary to be able to implement a programme for government it would be nice if alun michael and welsh affairs select committee co operated in that aim
6505936 our main science goal is to understand the large scale structure of the universe
6505937 this instrument can help us understand the composition of this cosmic web including how galaxies like our own milky way formed and evolved over time
6505938 there are hundreds or thousands of new targets in our sights that are just too faint to image with hubbles other instruments
6505939 the opportunity to do great science was very clear to everyone in the astronomical community
6505940 as discuss es continuam houve algum progresso nos ltimos dias mas ainda n o h um acordo final
6505941 the investments would pay for satellite and ground based instruments that observe the earths climate and for computers to help make weather predictions more accurate
6505942 a sharp increase in federal climate funding roughly 9 billion above the 10 billion five year budget projection for the multi agency climate change science program
6505943 when it comes to decadal predictions that explain anything more than a tiny fraction of the variability in anything more than a tiny fraction of the land area i have yet to be shown any result that says that this is possible even theoretically
6505944 it is not a new issue sometimes we get it right and sometimes we dont
6505945 so we definitely try to find a halfway solution in qualifying to have maybe a car that is not exactly what we want but is maybe a bit easier to drive and doesnt have the issues that we dont want but we are still looking for it and it depends a lot on the circuits
6505946 some circuits it is easier to get it right at some it is very difficult hopefully we have found some halfway solution where we are fast but can still be happy with
6505947 the last race if you look you could not get past anybody if they did not make a mistake
6505948 so it is the same here the circuit is very wide and there are some long straights so here there are some better overtaking chances than it was in hungary
6505949 but still if you are not in front then you are going to lose many seconds stuck behind people even if you get past them in the end it is always crucial to be at the front
6505950 i havent been fast enough that is the first point
6505951 without going off in the last qualifying we could easily have been in third place so it is the small things that when it goes wrong you lose a lot of time and it looks much worse than it is
6505952 it can be just a small issue and it makes you go off the circuit and run wide and you lose a lot of time
6505953 since we changed to these tyres even last year i wasnt exactly happy in qualifying even though in race conditions we are much happier with the car
6505954 lately the races have not been exactly what i was expecting so hopefully we will get some good races now and get back where we should be

6505965 la prima anche dal punto di vista della qualit vero valore aggiunto del vino italiano
6505966 ci fa piacere constatare la leadership quantitativa raggiunta dice il ministro ma soprattutto ci inorgoglisce la conferma del primato della qualit dei vini italiani tra i quali si contano 316 doc 38 docg e 118 igt
6505967 ottenuto grazie al lavoro delle tante piccole e medie imprese vitivinicole aggiunge il ministro che negli ultimi ventanni hanno saputo innovarsi e custodire allo stesso tempo quel patrimonio di storia identit e tradizione enologiche oggi conosciuti e apprezzati sui mercati internazionali

6505974 the prosecutor told jurors the case will boil down to a few questions
6505975 prohibit the defendant from referencing this lawsuit at any fashion at trial including its filings as well as any rulings or determinations issued
6505976 the admission of such evidence will only serve to confuse distract and mislead the jury
6505977 prohibit the defendant from suggesting to the jury that schmitz could fulfill her obligations to the city program by advocating on its behalf or providing any advice or assistance on matters concerning the legislature
6505978 develop and maintain a positive working relationship with members of the state of alabama legislative delegation various city and county officials relative to city locations
6505979 establish a positive working relationship with various state service providers i e department of human resources department of mental health and department of youth services
6505980 prosecutors outlined the case theyll present against schmitz in a 41 page trial memorandum after it was reviewed by the birmingham news that document was sealed by a federal judge
6505981 good god these prosecutors are arguing for the judge to make rulings that they know are not lawful these people are interested in convictions not justice if they had been interested in justice this case never would have been brought
6505982 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6505983 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6505984 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6505985 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6505986 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6505987 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6505988 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally

6506031 the first thing id do would be talk to the curator figure out how many pups for how long figure out a place where they could be appropriately placed
6506032 we would certainly be willing to make some phone calls
6506033 because we had no offers from zoos or other facilities to take in such pups
6506034 they really didnt make any effort ahead of time to try and place the pups
6506035 the conventions provide a big national spotlight for both candidates a chance to have the stage when voters are actually paying attention
6506036 it is an incredible opportunity to tell the american people your vision for the country and what you will do as president and that can change the dynamics of the race

6506052 too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members who know how to build and assemble the final released product
6506053 such knowledge centralization not only creates engineering redundancy issues but it also endangers gpl compliance which requires you to provide build scripts
6506054 the companies we contact about gpl violations often respond with we didnt know there was gpld stuff in there

6506114 russia cuts czech oil supplies after radar deal with us jul 13 2008 10 05 gmt prague moscow russia slashed oil supplies to the czech republic immediately after last weeks signing of a czech us missile defence agreement czech officials confirmed sunday but czech government commissioner vaclav bartuska denied the move was in retaliation for prague allowing washington to base a radar system on its soil as part of a missile shield programme opposed by moscow speaking to deutsche presse agentur dpa bartuska ruled out a technical problem citing the uninterrupted flow of russian oil to neighbouring countries such as poland he also said a retaliatory move was unlikely because his country could easily obtain oil via another pipeline running through germany but he declined to comment on reports from moscow that the reduction might be linked to an internal russian conflict over oil export rights in the wake of the handover of power in the kremlin the czech government has asked moscow to explain the reason for the reduction which began on july 4 but increased markedly after us secretary of state condoleeza rice and czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg signed the radar deal on july 8 the business magazine euro said cutback in supplies via the drushba pipeline could go down from the agreed 500 000 tons in july to 300 000 tons russia has in the past reduced energy supplies to the west for both political and economic reasons oil concern lukoil has cut deliveries to germany twice in recent months because it was unhappy at the price being paid lithuania via a northern branch of the drushba pipeline have been cut for two years because of what moscow calls a technical defect eu and nato leaders believe political motives are the reason in 2006 russias gazprom cut gas supplies to ukraine in a pricing dispute and accused the country of siphoning off supplies meant for other countries ukraine and its western allies saw the move as a political warning to the countrys pro western leadership something which moscow denied
6506115 we have been given no grounds to believe these issues will be resolved before senior international staff and their families will have to leave russia unfortunately this now appears very likely
6506116 we have been working with the russian authorities and within russian laws since april to resolve these issues and will continue to do so
6506117 there is an idea of building a gas pipeline to abkhazia directly from russia but no decision has been taken so far it is just being studied

6506122 in the past first time homebuyers were willing to purchase older more basic houses in an effort to save money and break into homeownership
6506123 today this group has greater home expectations because they have grown up more accustomed to their parents lifestyles
6506124 first time homebuyers now have higher standards placing an increased focus on the financial aspects of home ownership and at the same time want a larger home they can live in right away

6506148 i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job
6506149 consistent with the weak economy right now probably an economy in recession
6506150 we do not see any indication of meaningful near term improvement
6506151 99 per cent of their assets in gold and no cash flow
6506152 you should be careful not to be eaten by bears in all asset market
6506153 the us money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history heightening the risk of a wall street crunch and a severe economic slowdown
6506154 data compiled by lombard street research shows that the m3 broad money aggregates fell by almost us50 billion in july the biggest one month fall since modern records began in 1959
6506155 but i see that hedge funds are circulating a report from the us guru jeremy grantham predicting a very bad end to gordon browns debt experiment
6506156 the uk housing event is probably second only to the japanese 1990 land bubble in the real estate bubble hall of fame
6506157 if prices go all the way back to trend and history says that is extremely likely then the uk financial system will need some serious bail outs and the global ripples will be substantial
6506158 bulls now believe america is turning the corner financial stocks are up 20 since early july some monoline bond insurers have risen 1200 in a month as fears of gotterdammerung give way to sheer intoxicating relief and a short squeeze such are bear trap rallies
6506159 the futures market is pricing a 33 fall in us house prices from peak to trough based on the case shiller index banks have not come close to writing off implied losses on this scale
6506160 i do not think we are near the end of write downs i continue to see capital levels going lower and stocks going lower
6506161 this painful ordeal is far from over we are not witnessing a dollar rally so much as a collapse in european and commodity currencies the race to the bottom has begun in earnest
6506162 either in recession or face significant recession risks in the months ahead
6506163 i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job
6506164 the worst is yet to come in the u s
6506165 the economy has really shown one sign after another of weakening
6506166 continued robust albeit slowing growth in china and the rest of the emerging markets
6506167 it was a massive failure of the brains of the economy
6506168 there was a party going on and the regulator with the same mindset of those in the party didnt want to be a party pooper
6506169 the cost of regulation may be far greater than its benefits
6506170 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
6506171 oh by the way did you notice that the emperors got no clothes on
6506172 we have a subprime financial system not a subprime mortgage market
6506173 the uk housing event is probably second only to the japanese 1990 land bubble in the real estate bubble hall of fame uk house prices could easily decline 50 from the peak and at that level they would still be higher than they were in 1997 as a multiple of income
6506174 if prices go all the way back to trend and history says that is extremely likely then the uk financial system will need some serious bail outs and the global ripples will be substantial
6506175 there is a limit how long you can do this there is a point where you take over the market
6506176 if we see banks becoming very dependent on central banks then we must push them to tap other sources of funding
6506177 nobody dares pinpoint the country involved because as soon as we do it will cause a market reaction and lead to a meltdown for the banks
6506178 what we should avoid is some kind of arbitrage by banks which say they are going to go to central bank x instead of central bank y because conditions are more attractive
6506179 congress gave the fdic the mandate to replenish the fund through higher premiums on the industry
6506180 the fdic has some flexibility in setting premiums which will require striking a balance between building the fund quickly and ensuring that banks have sufficient funds to support the credit needs of the economy
6506181 to slam an eight 10 or 15 cent premium thats going to cripple a lot of banks
6506182 they dont want headlines suggesting the deposit fund is shrinking and inadequate
6506183 there is deep discounting in inland markets that have been slammed by foreclosures
6506184 were burning through them at a better rate than we were
6506185 its not a bad sign that theyre selling from a market stability standpoint
6506186 actually what it should read is foreclosed house prices plunge the data show a much smaller price decline between 5 percent and 10 percent in the core bay area of silicon valley oakland berkeley san francisco and marin if foreclosure sales are omitted
6506187 from an average persons perspective until prices start to stabilize they think why buy today when tomorrow will probably be cheaper
6506188 focused on efforts that will encourage market stability mortgage availability and protecting the taxpayer
6506189 hopes that making government support more explicit would add stability have backfired as holders further down the capital structure have turned up the heat eradicating value ahead of a potentially damaging capital infusion
6506190 they pay dividends they have investment grade credit ratings and their valuations are expected to normalize over the course of market cycles
6506191 we doubt that the bush administration will embrace a nationalization of the mortgage market in front of the elections
6506192 the fabric of those companies was so intertwined with its political patrimony that ordinary considerations were put aside for what was or wasnt politically acceptable
6506193 as a result of that the way one would operate a business according to business standards gave way to operating a business in a way that was palatable to a political system
6506194 it would be a mistake for the government to try and operate the whole mortgage finance business in the long run
6506195 i dont jump to the conclusion that it is a bad thing
6506196 fannie and freddie have stood up better and functioned better than a lot of private institutions
6506197 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything i dont anticipate that they will do that
6506198 what is the normalized pre bubble savings rate you dont have to dial back to the jurassic period just the late 80s or 90s
6506199 before we became addicted to asset bubbles the savings rate was roughly 8 percent
6506200 weve never been in a recession with the interest ratio where the household side is today
6506201 you are talking about the need to eliminate 350 billion of debt service about 2 trillion of household debt has to be totally eradicated
6506202 we are lowering our third quarter estimates to reflect the difficult operating environment characterized by lower client related trading volumes and losses on hard to sell assets
6506203 based on further deterioration in several indices we expect further writedowns primarily related to mortgage assets
6506204 even under the potentially more stringent rating agency guidelines related to the amount of preferred securities in the capital mix we anticipate that lehman can absorb over 3 billion of after tax losses without adding more common equity
6506205 the plus was that there was continuity the negative side was that as the game changed the senior people became too removed
6506206 it seems highly unlikely that the firms had no understanding of what was happening in the ars market
6506207 continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6506208 with that in mind your member firms should consider liquidating the ars investments of their clients especially those clients who were marketed and sold these instruments by your firms
6506209 our focus has been and remains on investors and ensuring they can liquidate their ars positions as soon as possible
6506210 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of our firms culpability
6506211 our focus has been and remains on investors and ensuring they can liquidate their ars positions as soon as possible
6506212 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6506213 these firms are licenses broker dealers and were obviously well paid by their clients for their specialized knowledge and diligence regarding the appropriateness of various products as investments
6506214 the brokers at merrill are very upset about the lack of access to capital for their clients and they have been rattling the cage
6506215 the only thing we care about is getting our clients redeemed as quickly as possible
6506216 this was a grassroots effort reflecting the opinion of a group of financial advisers
6506217 the firm continues to work with all interested parties at resolving the liquidity challenge caused by the unprecedented freezing of the auction rate securities market
6506218 we continue to work constructively with all major market participants to address the unprecedented issues in the auction rate market
6506219 we fear that our financial advisers view blackrock as conspicuous by its absence
6506220 its safe to say were not pleased that what was marketed as highly rated investment grade securities in our portfolio are illiquid and have lost value
6506221 to focus more on taking care of the small guys
6506222 it does seem like there are also some promises of assistance to larger companies over time
6506223 a lot of institutions were lied to by their brokers and brokerage firms put their own interests ahead of their institutional customers
6506224 cuomo was run over in his haste to get a settlement by these major firms
6506225 they have fewer resources to begin with the institutional investors we also believe need fairness and need equity and to the extent they were victimized they need to be compensated
6506226 if we believe those best efforts are not achieving the fair and just goal then we can take action
6506227 to play a growing role in the financing of sallie maes private credit loans
6506228 many states have reduced their revenue forecasts some many times
6506229 in a number of states collections are even below the lowered expectations
6506230 will mean less money in the hands of politicians and will give back an average of 3 700 to each of 3 4 million workers and taxpayers in massachusetts not just once but every year
6506231 there are tax cut activists around the country who are very interested in what were doing here
6506232 if it does well we may see copycat initiatives in 2010 and 2012 across the country
6506233 this extreme measure would throw the finances of state and local governments into chaos and inevitably lead to major increases in property and sales taxes
6506234 a cut of this magnitude would severely reduce the ability of the commonwealth to provide the services that citizens and taxpayers have come to expect from their state government
6506235 the dramatic increase in wholesale energy prices we have experienced in the uk
6506236 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6506237 these enormous price hikes will be a huge blow to millions of people already wondering just how theyre going to pay their bills this winter we are extremely concerned that the one in three pensioner households likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of the year will feel forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
6506238 expropriation of foreign owned assets is on the rise not surprisingly when an investment has done well local partners have a greater incentive to try to steal it
6506239 we all have scars from falling out with sponsor you need protection should it break down
6506240 we dont see an emerging market like russia as our core focus oligarchs are inevitably going to be better connected than us
6506241 you cannot count on the efficiency of legal systems in some countries to resolve differences
6506242 there are emerging market private equity funds that have seen their investments stolen which is obviously not the exit you would hope for the favoured technique at present is a collusive lawsuit in which a plaintiff secretly controlled by the local partner sues the foreign investor in a local court
6506243 the yen has risen as concerns tick up about the health of financial companies worldwide and the outlook for the global economy
6506244 these concerns are likely to remain simmering which is going to keep the yen somewhat supported
6506245 it was the right decision to sell the bank as quickly as possible
6506246 ikb could eventually play a role in german banking consolidation or be of interest for a foreign bank
6506247 if theres an opportunity we would like to look at it
6506248 whether we do it depends on our assessment and risk diversification
6506249 one has to believe in investing in the longer term whether locally or globally
6506250 the pessimism driving the western financial institutions down is so extreme right now that for longer term investors like temasek it does make sense to get some exposure

6506261 li voi sap tutti allora kekka checca kikka fra frency francy tata stella mozzarellina e una volta anche un coniglia
6506262 uiteindelijk komt men er vanzelf wel achter dus als iedereen het nou gewoon eens zou afwachten
6506263 well sad to know that you are facing criminal charges but i fail to understand that when you are yourself so well placed what made you demand
6506264 so you seem to have decided the verdict yourself as is evident from your question
6506265 its ok am used to it but it is a truth that i demanded dowry from her you heard it right
6506266 i see hats off to you and sorry once again for that question it was just framed badly not intended that way
6506267 it looks pretty nice its very wide and the surface looks very smooth it looks pretty fun so we will see tomorrow it looks nice when you walk it but it is a different story when you go 300km h around it but i expect to have good fun when we drive around
6506268 it takes a few laps when you know where to go but you learn and learn all the time small things and small lines but i would not say it is too hard
6506269 there are a few bumps because i guess they need to turn the bridge sometimes that is the only place where i found any bumps on the circuit and one of them is in the middle of the corner so that might affect things a bit but apart from that the circuit looks very smooth and very well done we will see tomorrow how good it is in the end but i expect to have quite good fun
6506270 definitely we would rather have won more races we had some chances but in the end we couldnt win them but we are still in a good position for the championship although the season could have been much better it could also have been much worse
6506271 overall i am happy where we are right now lately the races have not been exactly what i was expecting so hopefully we will get some good races now and get back where we should be the biggest issue is getting stuck behind people after having a bad qualifying so if we can sort out that then we should be fine we just need to work on some things and hopefully we will get back to winning some races
6506272 there are some circuits coming that i enjoy hopefully we can get things sorted out so that we can really fight for wins we have the good speed as long as we can use it in qualifying in the race we should be fine
6506273 i dont really worry about anything there are many races to go it is easy to lose points but also easy to win we will try to do the best every weekend and hopefully after a few races we are still in a good position and then we can try and win the championship
6506274 more or less there is pressure every race so it doesnt really change anything when it gets later in the season when you have the chance to win the championship it is more crucial not to make any mistakes but that is normal all the time like i said we will do the best we can every race and then see where we end up
6506275 we will try at least at the last race i ran off the circuit as the handling was not what we expected i just ran wide it is always easy to say that i have fixed this or that but we should be fine
6506276 we know when we get everything as we want that we have the speed but it hasnt been easy it is a similar situation to last year so its not the first time to be in this position hopefully we can fix it now and have better qualifying and better races after that
6506277 every race is crucial its not just monaco the last race if you look you could not get past anybody if they did not make a mistake so it is the same here the circuit is very wide and there are some long straights so here there are some better overtaking chances than in hungary
6506278 but still if you are not in front then you are going to lose many seconds stuck behind people even if you get past them in the end it is always crucial to be at the front
6506279 there is no one issue sometimes it goes right sometimes not at the last race i ran off the circuit which doesnt help but like i said we havent been exactly happy with the handling and it easily makes it look worse than it is
6506280 the problem is that it is very close between everybody now and if you are one tenth slower you lose three places we would have fixed it if we knew what to do but i think we will find a solution we just need to put more effort in and try to get it right
6506281 q do you think the summer break was a help for you allowing you to recharge a bit
6506282 i really dont know we will see tomorrow and over the weekend but i enjoyed it i had a good time we havent had good races lately for many different reasons but we know we have the speed if we get things right so im not too worried about it the main thing like i said before is the qualifying after that we have good speed when we get it right
6506283 q do you think the summer break was a help for you allowing you to recharge a bit
6506284 gas is so expensive now yesterday i deposited 15 gallons to start my sons college fund
6506285 honey i dont want my son to become a gas fund baby he needs to learn how to earn his own livings
6506286 but occasionally i still need to drive to the gas station a trip to gas station is some horrifying experience nowadays
6506287 ok enough complaints about gas price there is nothing i can do about it maybe i will trade in my suv for a smaller and lighter car pushing my suv to the rooftop parking top is quite challenging and really i shouldnt be complaining about driving cars after all it is part of an american dream you know the american dream that one day you will have a big house with a backyard and a dog and a car i am still having trouble finding someone who offers to sell a backyard and a dog though
6506288 people should make money in sustainable manners just because of the need to feed the family one can trigger the cause of biodiversity loss by trading endangered animals
6506289 the most recent land acquisition we did was of a piece of land in bangalore which cost us about 80 million thats expensive but we believe the only way to make money is to buy these prime pieces of land and construct the right product
6506290 this will be our second investment in india so here weve committed about 300 million we believe that the strategy of this company to pick up strategic pieces of land in city centres is very good so even in a correction these places will have demand
6506291 the mccain campaign continues to level dishonest attacks on barack obamas integrity and patriotism

6506294 know the truth and the truth will set you free
6506295 what will set you free is not truth but truthfulness
6506296 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
6506297 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of aug 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6506298 high energy prices have led to an increase in biodiesel production which in turn has led to an increase in the amount of crude glycerol in the market
6506299 we have shown that it is possible to use the crude glycerol byproduct from the biodiesel industry as a carbon source for microalgae that produce omega 3 fatty acids
6506300 after thorough chemical analysis we have also shown that the algae biomass composition has the same quality as the commercial algae product
6506301 the fish fed the algae had significant amounts of omega 3 fatty acids
6506302 production of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid from biodiesel waste glycerol by microalgal fermentation agfd 272
6506303 i can see 21 t 72 tanks moving towards the roki tunnel in the direction of russia
6506304 i can also see four grad artillery launchers several and heavy trucks ready to move into the tunnel
6506305 there has not been much evidence of any significant russian withdrawals
6506306 these principles allow the russian peacekeepers to take additional measures to ensure security in the security zone
6506307 they dont show any sign that they want to give up control
6506308 it looks like the word withdrawal is understood in different ways by different people
6506309 i can only say that russia needs cooperation with nato no more than nato needs russia
6506310 what we have just seen is atrocious there are russian interior ministry special forces bringing old people from villages basically emptying the villages on the south ossetian side and dumping them in gori

6506317 among our clients we have no real money investors interested in holding any venezuelan paper
6506318 id assume that a lot of the guys that do still hold the bonds are there only on a short term basis
6506319 steel oil joint ventures telecommunications electricity the third biggest bank and on monday cement the growing number of industries falling into the hands of the venezuelan government is making president hugo ch vezs so called 21st century socialism look more and more like the plain old 20th century version

6506377 our goal is always to deliver sports to fans across any platform and this is yet another agreement that fulfills that strategy
6506378 bring our game to our fans in a variety of new and exciting ways
6506379 it is a sad day for the nfl but genes positive impact and legacy will live on for decades to come goodell
6506380 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6506381 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6506382 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6506383 gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize new york jets chairman robert wood johnson
6506384 gene was an outstanding advocate for the players and he made many great contributions to our sport he was also a good and decent man he will be sorely missed new york giants president john mara
6506385 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6506386 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6506387 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6506388 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6506389 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6506390 you add that all up and its not a good year to be running as a republican in wisconsin for president
6506391 its an open question how much the race tightens up and whether wisconsin turns out to be right on the cusp nationally like it has been in previous elections or whether it leans democratic
6506392 i believe we have delivered the biggest modernization of the atp tour since its inception have attracted unprecedented levels of investment into mens tennis and have begun to feed the growing appetite for mens tennis globally both in established and emerging markets de villiers said
6506393 i am honored to have played a part in taking our great sport to the next level
6506394 now that this much needed change has been realized i believe this is the right time for someone new to build on this strong platform
6506395 the war in iraq is even less popular in oregon than it is nationally
6506396 an underlying economic trend that on balance works to the benefit of the democrats
6506397 theyll run ads theyll maintain an office he may even visit the state briefly
6506398 but i would guess its not a high priority simply because hes got other states that hes probably more concerned about
6506399 the embedded republican vote in a presidential election has been fairly solid for almost three decades now so you would have to say that mccain has an edge
6506400 i dont think obamas going to pull through in north carolina hes just not going to get enough of the white vote
6506401 it will be a little bit more difficult for mccain to consolidate the republican base here in washington state then it will be for obama to consolidate those clinton supporters
6506402 might realize they can stay home or even vote for mccain and still not derail obamas path to the presidency
6506403 going to react very well to the message of improving the economy ending the war making health care available and affordable improving education and right down the line
6506404 there doesnt seem to be any letup of the move toward democrats in terms of party registration in terms of party id
6506405 democrats in the state by and large are upper income high education liberal
6506406 we certainly anticipate that this is going to be a close race
6506407 no member of the sununu family has lost an election since 1980
6506408 there are a lot of republicans in new mexico who are not as excited about their senate candidate as the democrats are about theirs
6506409 reagan democrats in some races but they are still democrats
6506410 he tenido muy buena sensaci n lo conoc a por v deos de las carreras de hace un mes de gt y f3 de los planos que ten a pero caminando y vi ndolo in situ he confirmado la idea que ten a

6506413 a renault no se le puede haber olvidado hacer un coche campe n
6506414 early on hillary clinton sort of wrapped up the establishment democrats so pretty much everything obama did here was outside of the traditional democratic organization
6506415 if everything falls right and everything happens right he definitely could win
6506416 theres some really very strong blue areas the twin cities are about as liberal as you can get particularly minneapolis and some very strong red areas and then youve got these kind of lighter shades but purple not statewide
6506417 de cualquier forma todos los pilotos estamos en las mismas condiciones desde luego nosotros hemos preparado a conciencia esta carrera pero las impresiones que tendremos en pista a partir de ma ana ser n fundamentales
6506418 voy a trabajar muy cerca de mis ingenieros en los pr ximos d as porque necesito tener muchos datos

6506429 major league baseball is very pleased with this opportunity to enhance our partnership with espn
6506430 we have a great relationship with espn and this new agreement will bring our game to our fans in a variety of new and exciting ways
6506431 this agreement further solidifies the great relationship we have with major league baseball and together with our television deal allows us to bring the game of baseball to more fans than ever before
6506432 our goal is always to deliver sports to fans across any platform and this is yet another agreement that fulfills that strategy
6506433 this guy is to running what j rod is to saves
6506434 this games amazing in that it has a way of humbling you
6506435 this is the major leagues people have scouting reports on you and it catches up with you pretty quick thats a fact of life
6506436 veterans dont give out a lot of love until you earn it it keeps you humble and wanting more you cant change your personality if things go well or go bad you have to be the same guy win or lose
6506437 its a lot more effective to do it in an easygoing nature
6506438 but i can get on you pretty quick if you dont catch on
6506439 theres a lot of teams complaining right now that their bullpen is worn out
6506440 the best way for your bullpen not to fail is to have your starters go deeper into games
6506441 ive always been a big believer that the more relievers you use the more chances that someone is going to be off his game
6506442 the back side of that is our two main starters ben sheets and cc sabathia having one less start at the end of the year
6506443 but theyre healthier i think theyre stronger and they go deeper into games the back end of that is the bullpen is stronger and healthier and not used as much
6506444 so here we come into september with a very strong bullpen a bullpen thats almost borderline rusty when other bullpens are borderline worn out
6506445 the biggest boost has been cc because you can see guys step up and try to follow him
6506446 that was one of the biggest things i sat and reviewed all winter long in terms of my own performance and what happened last year and what can i do better
6506447 you have to be able to give your starters a little leeway to work out of situations instead of always being cautious and bringing in a reliever to stop things for the most part its worked out
6506448 there were times last year where guys were going pretty good and they would get in a little bit of trouble and there would be two outs in the sixth inning boom i would pull the plug and get a reliever i was too quick to do that sometimes
6506449 then i realized this year wait a minute im back to having good starters and i have to get back to my original mind set and do what i know is right stick with those guys they dont want somebody else coming in and either getting them out or giving their runs up they want the ability to handle the situation themselves so i went back to my original mind set
6506450 its always a tough thing when you have to be pinch hit for because the team is down
6506451 as long as you have the lead ned will do everything he can to stay with that starter
6506452 i think some of these guys have learned the longer rope

6506458 by mid 2003 we were using a patchwork of homegrown point specific or one off mechanisms for moving data and converting it to appropriate windows unix and mainframe formats
6506459 in addition to manual and technical inefficiencies the types of data transfer protocols we could offer were restricted and the governance of data movement was limited
6506460 proginets web enabled enterprisewide solution supported multiple file transfer protocols
6506461 for the internet facing component we purchased and installed two redmond wash based microsoft windows enabled servers for internal processes cyberfusion was installed on existing application servers
6506462 we rolled out cyberfusion by process such as ach transmissions
6506463 as we proceeded it became clear that our existing processes were more intertwined than we anticipated and our soft target for completion shifted to late 2009
6506464 we continually discover additional legacy transfer protocols that our customers use
6506465 it requires coordination among our business and it units as well as with similar groups within our customers organizations
6506466 data security is significantly increased because were able to use secure protocols such as sftp secure file transfer protocol
6506467 were more competitive because we now offer a wide range of protocols and we can meet customer needs with a few mouse clicks rather than in the weeks it required previously
6506468 if processing was set to start at 3 a m and the data file hadnt arrived yet the job would fail now post processing is kicked off by cyberfusion only after a file has arrived eliminating job failure investigation alone saves us half a full time equivalent every week
6506469 cyberfusion creates an intuitive and complete audit trail regardless of transmission type hardware systems or software applications
6506470 by providing report and audit access rights to business unit managers weve reduced risk because information gathering is fast self service and decentralized consequently it time spent researching and generating reports is down from six hours per week to one
6506471 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass
6506472 felipe was sagst du zu dem was du bisher von der strecke hier in valencia gesehen hast
6506473 beeindruckend interessant ich denke es ist eine ganz andere strecke als die anderen auf dem kalender ein paar kurven sind vielleicht so hnlich wie in monaco aber es gibt auch einige ganz andere kurven und lange geraden das erinnert mich eher an bahrain ich finde die strecke sehr nett morgen wird es sehr sehr schmutzig denn man kann sehen dass der asphalt sehr rutschig ist aber es wird schon gehen ich mag die stadt daher w nsche ich mir f r uns fahrer aber auch f r die fans ein gutes rennen
6506474 die scheinen okay zu sein wir m ssen aber erst einmal fahren und abwarten wie es im auto aussieht speziell wenn der grip vom asphalt her passt m sste es in ordnung sein wenn nicht dann sind die auslaufzonen schnell kleiner als gedacht
6506475 hast du die entt uschung des sp ten motorschadens von budapest schon berwunden
6506476 ja sicher wir m ssen nach vorne schauen auf die n chsten sieben rennen wir wissen dass noch 70 punkte zu vergeben sind und wir m ssen unser bestes geben um wieder aufzuholen r ckblickend h tte ich das letzte rennen nat rlich gerne gewonnen aber so ist der sport eben manchmal das wichtigste ist dass wir konkurrenzf hig sind ich h tte im qualifying um die pole fahren k nnen denn die pace des autos war gro artig ich hatte jedoch keine gute runde das war der grund im rennen haben wir dann aber unsere wahre performance gezeigt der speed war klasse eine gute pace wir haben gezeigt dass wir da sind und das ist am wichtigsten das kann in den n chsten rennen entscheiden
6506477 ist die schlechte performance von ferrari in der ersten runde nur noch geschichte habt ihr diesen bereich optimiert
6506478 ich denke schon meine runde in q2 war gro artig ich steckte in q3 ein bisschen im verkehr fest und wenn du so einen starken gegner wie mclaren hast dann stehst du halt gleich mal nicht auf pole ich war aber froh dar ber dritter und nicht zweiter zu sein denn damit konnte ich auf der sauberen fahrbahnseite starten
6506479 eure motorenzuverl ssigkeit war meistens hervorragend kimi r ikk nen ist in magny cours sogar mit einem gebrochenen auspuff ins ziel gekommen aber h tten die ingenieure bei dir in budapest etwas anders machen k nnen ist die ursache schon gekl rt
6506480 nein wir h tten nichts anders machen k nnen das problem war diesmal ein ganz anderes das kommt vielleicht einmal in zehn jahren vor es war ein produktionsfehler eines teils dagegen kann man nichts machen wir hatten dieses problem nie zuvor nur just in dem einen moment da ist man machtlos
6506481 ob du punkte verlierst oder nicht aber das ist schon seit dem ersten rennen der schl ssel alle von uns haben dieses jahr wichtige punkte verloren der schl ssel liegt darin konstant zu sein aber das sagen schon seit dem ersten rennen alle daran hat sich nichts ge ndert

6506498 orchids are popular flowers but it is important that they are left to flourish in their natural environment in this case the limestone area of the white peak
6506499 we have hundreds of volunteers dedicated to helping republican candidates on the ticket this november including electing john mccain for president re electing senator susan collins electing our republican congressional candidates and candidates for state and local offices
6506500 saturday is going to be an outstanding show of support for republican candidates on novembers ballot this remarkable effort would not be possible without such a phenomenal group of committed and energized volunteers

6506510 i think the team is definitely talking to fernando but thats the question mark
6506511 i have never been so enthusiastic about my whole situation with the team
6506512 i left ferrari because i didnt have the freedom to do what i wanted to do
6506513 i have that at honda but i still have not had the car to perform and i am waiting for that chance
6506514 what can i say but honestly the day that i feel that i am slower than my first race is the day i will call it off and stop
6506515 the conversations are there and i am talking to the team i am talking to all the teams i want to be racing
6506516 i think in terms of pure developments aerodynamic and mechanical thats it
6506517 but we have to optimise everything that we brought to hungary and before we have new little things in place
6506518 we had a new rear suspension for hungary but unfortunately we couldnt rig test it before because of lack of time and in these two weeks we could see that there was a big margin for improvement
6506519 and the spirit is good because although the preparation for next year is already in place people are working very very hard with the tools that we have in hand to improve the car
6506520 i am definitely looking forward to the end of the season with the tracks that are coming on as we can score points

6506547 the guards suspected the animal might be involved in drug smuggling once they noticed four prisoners visibly intoxicated shortly after the pigeon landed on a prison window

6506552 el juicio pol tico no debe realizarse y si se tiene que ir debe alcanzarse alg n tipo de compromiso

6506554 la actitud india es muy contradictoria por un lado se enorgullece de ser una democracia y se ha unido a la iniciativa global para promoverla liderada por estados unidos pero por el otro lado no da la bienvenida a la democratizaci n cuando se produce en su propia regi n
6506555 la incoherencia india hacia pakist n nace de una profunda falla conceptual
6506556 muchos pol ticos creen al igual que sus colegas estadounidenses que es m s f cil tratar con el poder cuando est concentrado en las manos de un individuo o una instituci n como el ej rcito pero en realidad quienes tienen el poder en una democracia son m s responsables
6506557 un nuevo grupo de dirigentes lo ha reemplazado y tiene que tratar con ellos no es un signo de madurez decir que hay en pakist n un vac o de poder porque no existe adem s musharraf no tuvo mucho xito en mantener a los militantes bajo control
6506558 sin duda la renuncia de musharraf es resultado de un gran cambio en la opini n p blica atribuible fundamentalmente a la movilizaci n de la sociedad civil para lograr la reincorporaci n de los jueces que l hab a desplazado y a la actitud cada vez m s irreverente de la prensa
6506559 no hay nada nico en el apoyo de musharraf al proceso de paz con india ya que es un objetivo compartido por los principales partidos pol ticos y la sociedad no se detendr a causa de su renuncia en realidad se hab a convertido en un obst culo por su creciente impopularidad

6506575 no podemos decidir c mo reacciona la gente a lo que nosotros hacemos

6506766 een tiental jaar geleden liep ik soupa ju zang gitaar red die ondertussen onze manager is toevallig tegen het lijf op een festival waar wij beide moesten optreden we hebben toen lang gediscussieerd over muziek en na die eerste kennismaking hebben we besloten om ons samen te concentreren op onze eigen unieke versie van muziek daar is eigenlijk alles mee begonnen
6506767 in de reggae de groove en de soulmuziek en mijn ouders luisterden vaak gospel met watchaclan wou ik absoluut geen reggae spelen want dat wordt al zoveel gedaan en ik heb teveel respect voor die fantastische muziek uit de jaren zestig en zeventig om daar een goedkope versie van neer te zetten ik heb me dan afgevraagd wat soort muziek bob marley vandaag zou gemaakt hebben moest hij nog geleefd hebben lacht misschien zou hij dan ook wel met dub en elektronica zijn gaan experimenteren voor ons heeft die weg in ieder geval geleid naar meer interessante mogelijkheden voor onze sound cl ment aka supr me clem toetsen melodica accordeon samplers ritmebox red kan een machine echt doen swingen en zijn elektronica heeft ons ook echt wegen laten bewandelen waar we anders nooit terechtgekomen zouden zijn de basis van onze muziek blijft toch reggae zelfs drum amp bass is eigenlijk een ver familielid van de reggae en zo bekijk ik onze muziek dus ook al moet je je waarschijnlijk wel openstellen om die invloeden nog te horen
6506768 watcha is een verbastering van watch me dus kijk naar mij of kijk naar ons
6506769 ja dat is het helemaal ik ben zelf van gemengd bloed en sta open voor alle culturen dat geldt natuurlijk ook op muzikaal vlak er bestaat natuurlijk muziek die ik goed of minder goed vind maar de muziek die ik wel kan appreci ren kan zowel hiphop als afrobeat of zelfs klassieke muziek zijn bij het componeren van onze songs laten wij onze gedachten en gevoelens volledig vrij en het resultaat is dan ook vaak een soort fusionmuziek persoonlijk houd ik echter absoluut niet van die term en ik omschrijf het dan ook liever als world amp bass
6506770 absoluut ja we hebben het daar trouwens ook over op ons laatste album diaspora hi fi red waar we in het openingsnummer les hommes libres zeggen nomaden zijn vrije mensen nomaden zijn mensen zonder adres of vaste verblijfplaats en dat maakt het overheden allerhande heel moeilijk om hen in een bepaald vak te duwen muzikaal gezien is dat op ons zeker ook van toepassing

6506802 on the boards he was hanging on to the puck or taking it away from bigger guys between having those skills when he has the puck in open ice and being able to get it himself those are two things that immediately jump out at you
6506803 you just let the coaches make the decision and when youre on the ice you play hockey and do your best
6506804 thats how i managed to play better in the last part of the season
6506805 but well see if its 20 its 20 if its 30 its 30 ill work to score as many goals as i can to make the team win

6506986 for south ossetia to lose 1 500 or 2 000 people today is a terrible tragedy but no one knows about it
6506987 to shoot at kids at children from a tank its a shame and the world should know about this shame
6506988 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6506989 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6506990 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6506991 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6506992 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6506993 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop we may be a few cents away from the august bottom
6506994 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent
6506995 terrified of allowing western countries to build any kind of cushion for the unexpected because it has the potential to return prices to normal or sustainable economic levels
6506996 we are certainly very excited about having these three players recognized
6506997 they have been the foundation of our program for the past several years and we expect them to lead us once again this year however we also recognize that this is a preseason selection and there is a long and challenging season ahead of us and what really matters is where you finish not where you start
6506998 considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
6506999 the nato airstrikes that were supposed to allow the soldiers under assault to get out of the trap according to the wounded missed their target and hit french soldiers along with other shots fired from afghan soldiers positioned below
6507000 were the victims of an extremely well prepared and murderous ambush we should not look here and there for other causes
6507001 the planes supplying close air support could not engage because french troops were very close to taliban insurgents and if they had engaged there may have been considerable collateral damage if the bombs had been used
6507002 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or injured were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6507003 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6507004 even if you have to sit together for a week
6507005 the threat that we are facing today has no precedent
6507006 our enemy lurks silently within our society this is our war
6507007 reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6507008 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6507009 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6507010 you will see a lot of satin and lace combined and rich colors such as burgundy and beige silver and peach as well as your classic black and white
6507011 it makes you feel incredible and offers variety as diverse as the women who will wear it
6507012 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6507013 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6507014 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6507015 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6507016 leading alliance members came to us and whispered in our ears hoping that we do not halt cooperation with nato on afghanistan
6507017 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6507018 most likely whatever the malfunction of the probe was it is probably not related to what happened
6507019 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6507020 the world is experiencing an energy shock of a kind not seen since the early 1970s
6507021 energy suppliers have to take steps towards covering their costs and i am sorry that we cannot delay these price rises any longer
6507022 we are extremely concerned that the one in three pensioner households likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of the year will feel forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
6507023 this is wonderful news for the performing arts center which is good in itself in that it makes san antonio a much better place to live
6507024 this speaks very loudly of at amp ts continued interest in san antonio which is what we want were very glad to have received this this showed much more than words that theyre still here
6507025 its a fair assessment to say were still invested in san antonio
6507026 not only for the foundation but for san antonio because i knew this had a very reassuring and deep message of support for san antonio the message everyone in san antonio should take from this is not just at amp ts support of the performing arts center but at amp ts support for san antonio
6507027 a full and complete cultural arts scene we felt that was important for san antonio
6507028 its the type of effort the whole community rallied around
6507029 its supported by the voters and now by the philanthropic community
6507030 oversee the renovation and construction process of transforming the municipal auditorium into a world class performing arts center
6507031 im just jumping up and down in my chair right now
6507032 because this is the first major gift to the bexar county performing arts foundation and the fact that its the largest cultural arts gift at amp t has made it shows what strong support at amp t has for the entire performing arts initiative being undertaken and it will kick off the private fundraising
6507033 byrd added that he had no superstitions about the number 36 just that he liked it and had worn it for a long time its involved in some of my passwords on the computer so if i switched numbers id have to change all that up no
6507034 i used to play that game every day and thats why i became a hockey fan thats how i got to know hockey and i fell in love with it back then
6507035 i really wanted the hockey show job and when i got it i was like uh oh what am i going to do because not only was i scared of the players i was scared of the fans because theyre so intense
6507036 and thats what the hockey show is about its the other side of the nhl we pay a lot of respect to the sport because it deserves that but we also give hockey fans a front row seat to the entertainment side of hockey
6507037 hockey certainly already crosses over into the world of celebrities
6507038 weve got the mike comrie hilary duff relationship going on the rachael hunter jarret stoll relationship on the show i do for people magazine online we actually featured hilary duff and mike one time and i hope to do more of that because there really is more to hockey than just the score
6507039 hockey is the only sport that makes me yell at the tv without even realizing im doing it
6507040 ill yell for whoevers doing good or whoevers doing really bad i think i lost my voice during the stanley cup playoffs last year
6507041 ill do the hockey show and when i get home ill get online and log on to facebook or myspace and really get into serious hockey talk with fans
6507042 its amazing to me that theyre logging on and talking from all over the world from germany sweden or the czech republic you see the worldwide appeal of the sport and thats awesome
6507043 id love to stick around the game for a long time because ive fallen in love with it even more now that ive really got my hands dirty with it
6507044 so id like to see how the league develops because its really growing again and i hope that trend keeps going theres so much history in the nhl and i hope more people learn to appreciate that the way i have
6507045 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of august 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6507046 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6507047 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
6507048 there has not been much evidence of any significant russian withdrawals there have been what i would call some minimal movements to date
6507049 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6507050 we always loved russians but the thing they are doing now is that they are ruining everything terrorizing people killing looting
6507051 rose you have nothing to worry about your food is even better than in lebanon
6507052 rose you have nothing to worry about your food is even better than in lebanon
6507053 us efforts to change the strategic balance of power in its favour
6507054 one of the instruments in an extremely dangerous bundle of us military projects involving the one sided development of a global anti missile system
6507055 i hope that there are not people in russia who are hankering for the days of u s soviet confrontation because they are over
6507056 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6507057 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6507058 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6507059 temporary decisions are being taken on current cooperation and not about cooperation in general
6507060 military naval exercises in the far east the mediterranean in the baltic
6507061 the nato airstrikes that were supposed to allow the soldiers under assault to get out of the trap according to the wounded missed their target and hit french soldiers along with other shots fired from afghan soldiers positioned below

6507065 the architecture in here is very mexican modeled after an architect in mexico named luis barragan a lot of his style architecture is what we tried to do
6507066 these are the type of things youd see in traditional mexican homes
6507067 its 100 percent authentic mexican cuisine its not tex mex its not cal mex its the real deal
6507068 if you go to an open air market in mexico these are the dishes you find in the stalls tacos tortillas quesadillas tostadas its more gentrified but we keep the same soul of the cuisine
6507069 we send our chefs down to oaxaca mexico to cook regularly
6507070 this may be hackensack but were trying to keep things as traditional as possible
6507071 the architecture in here is very mexican modeled after an architect in mexico named luis barragan a lot of his style architecture is what we tried to do

6507076 this may be hackensack but were trying to keep things as traditional as possible
6507077 striking how unqualified obama is and how this whole thing came about within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6507078 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6507079 even if you have to sit together for a week

6507093 and i think any volleyball player out there sacrificed a good portion of their life to do this and its worth it i would say its worth it even if we didnt make it here just for the experience along the way but its damn worth it now that we made it here i can tell you that much
6507094 we just came out there and fought and everything was right
6507095 once a breakthrough has really been achieved the draft will be presented to the council of ministers

6507130 the coleman action funds endorsements are an important step forward in building a stronger political voice for working families in san francisco so politicians dont ignore struggling families real issues
6507131 amend the city charter to establish a baseline appropriation and set aside the annual equivalent of the available annual tax of two and one half cents on each one hundred dollars of assessed property valuation for the next fifteen years
6507132 most kids in san francisco are from immigrant families like me and for us to stay here affordable housing a is really the number one issue
6507133 i am proud that our endorsements represent a diverse group of community leaders who will focus on transforming the citys public schools to benefit the students whove been left behind especially black and brown children
6507134 we want a school board passionately focused on academic success and equity without distraction or delay

6507136 the troughton era presented many a feminist role in the supporting cast yet the companions of the time were some of the most notable screamers in the series history
6507137 its really going to be a wonderful asset in the community
6507138 i cant imagine what it would be like for a college educated father to pose as a minimum wage earning illegal immigrant just to keep his son safe
6507139 and the son nineteen out of his twenty year life was spent as a fugitive thats intense but even more intense is how this all began
6507140 a bullet meant for me killed my law partner instantly it was a terrible tragedy
6507141 one day im laughing with my best friend and the next im a suspect in his murder
6507142 when my attorneys partner was murdered i knew who did it and i knew that i was next
6507143 this man sacrificed his whole life to protect his son
6507144 while on the run he fell in love got married had two daughters and managed to keep the entire family under the radar for 20 years talk about family secrets

6507147 im not sure im going to support obama but gee if his campaign is willing to send me a text announcing his v p well that changes everything
6507148 democrats shamelessly exploiting public ignorance about the constitution for their own gain even if it would cause some of their more paranoid idiot supporters to start mass riots
6507149 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6507150 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6507151 he clearly stated that we had no specific information on the number of casualties
6507152 we have been told that there have been casualties but we are not able to verify what casualties means whether people have been killed or whether they have been injured
6507153 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of the tibetan capital
6507154 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6507155 ten thousand people have been arrested we dont know where they are imprisoned
6507156 a project of long term brutal repression is under way
6507157 but we were quickly disillusioned our envoys came up against a wall there was no opening
6507158 real autonomy because we know what chinese style autonomy is a trap
6507159 take up the matter with the us government urgently to provide her necessary medical attention including hospitalisation and regular access to pakistan embassy officials
6507160 its got to be through relationships handing out religious tracts would not go over well at all that would be like me walking around with a free tibet flag
6507161 if foreigners do such things in china they violate the law and local religious departments and other departments should stop them
6507162 they looked for opportunities to talk to the locals and share about their faith
6507163 our goal was wanting to communicate the love of god to people not be overt
6507164 it was almost like they were treating us like criminals
6507165 when you assign a chaplain its almost like saying were bringing a team to china and assigning the coach well the coach doesnt know the players and only knows the sport we feel the spiritual realm is the same way
6507166 sp750 its based on the amazing 997 gt2 which is now out on our roads for about a year the standard porsche gt2 has 530 bhp togeter with 680 nm that is enough for a sprint to 62 mph 100 kmh in only 3 7 seconds and a topspeed of 204 mph 329 kmh a while back we had

6507171 pastoralism enabled people to adapt to an increasingly arid and unpredictable environment by moving livestock according to the shifting availability of water and pasture
6507172 t o be practiced effectively pastoralism depends on freedom of movement for all herds between pastures and water sources
6507173 pastoralist communities could have a sustainable and productive future in a world affected by climate change given the right enabling environment
6507174 the creation of this commission is a clear sellout to hillary clinton
6507175 i got the email from iowa obama campaign chair jackie norris this morning saying this wasnt a problem for iowa and wed all be fine but its a real threat and its really disappointing
6507176 it operates on the assumption that barack will be the president
6507177 the only way you might get around that is if the mandate creating the commission restricts them from considering the status of iowa and new hampshire its all up to obama
6507178 i think if he could get hillarys permission then that could go in but its clear that obama is perfectly willing to let her control this
6507179 the highest governing authority of the democratic party is the national convention
6507180 if they dont mandate that the commission is really free to do whatever it wants
6507181 we should be making the obama campaign aware that if he breaks his pledge to iowa or new hampshire it could have serious consequences to his ability to carry this state
6507182 in iowa its a threat in new hampshire its a reality
6507183 what did the church do to hurt you this deep
6507184 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
6507185 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay on for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
6507186 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
6507187 heres another man trying to keep up the customs of a patriarchal society by offering a poor defenseless woman his seat

6507193 absolutely your starting quarterback has to be ready for the first regular season game
6507194 with the guys that have played as long as he has played you are not quite as concerned about their minutes in the preseason
6507195 now i want him to feel better thats my main concern but as far as not playing or not getting enough reps i dont worry about that too much hell be fine
6507196 hes got a very good feel for playing quarterback and how a guy can use his tools to manipulate a defense and take advantage of a defense
6507197 that showed hes obviously got a grasp of what we do
6507198 he understands our offense extremely extremely well and he has performed very consistently throughout spring ball and fall camp
6507199 a few times before but i cant for the life of me remember why this sluts famous
6507200 discussions are ongoing with the iraqis to finalize a bilateral agreement
6507201 we are working to complete the agreement but it is not final yet
6507202 we have to let go and were not reluctant to do that and the iraqis are not reluctant to take control
6507203 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference the great difference is that i intend to win it first
6507204 im glad to see that president bush has finally come around to my view etc etc
6507205 its good news that iraq is now secure enough that we can envision bringing our troops home etc etc

6507209 the creation of this commission is a clear sellout to hillary clinton
6507210 i got the email from iowa obama campaign chair jackie norris this morning saying this wasnt a problem for iowa and wed all be fine but its a real threat and its really disappointing
6507211 it operates on the assumption that barack will be the president
6507212 the only way you might get around that is if the mandate creating the commission restricts them from considering the status of iowa and new hampshire its all up to obama
6507213 i think if he could get hillarys permission then that could go in but its clear that obama is perfectly willing to let her control this
6507214 the highest governing authority of the democratic party is the national convention
6507215 if they dont mandate that the commission is really free to do whatever it wants
6507216 really ever since spring ball allans been in the huddle hes been able to make calls hes had game adjustments
6507217 hes definitely got a lot of ability what hes been able to do these first couple weeks of camp is separate himself being able to manage and handle the game we want him to make good decisions we dont need him to be an all star we just need him to make the plays that are out there make the right throws
6507218 cpu idling at 80 85 degrees but i dont care i am not sending anything back to alienware and they refuse to send someone or the part here
6507219 when we first started out our audiences were maybe a little reflection of us you know people in their later 20s early 30s and predominately dudes guys who buy records and watch sports and a smattering of angry girlfriends
6507220 i think as the bands audience has grown weve actually expanded younger and there are a lot more girls coming to the shows and a lot of girls making their presence more upfront and thats just amazing

6507228 religion is not something you do on the weekends it is a complete thing
6507229 and music is also something that is there all the time
6507230 it is a balancing act as how much to be open and connected with the fans and how much to be in my own space
6507231 i never saw myself as any one thing or playing to one group of people
6507232 live music is a modern day worship kind of thing for a lot of people it is how young people get together and lose themselves in something bigger than themselves
6507233 it is a very unique spiritual experience for a lot of people and i try to create that
6507234 the next one is going to be five times more

6507237 globally aedas has been growing at a rate of about 15 20 percent per year and in asia specifically the companys business has grown at a very vigorous 50 percent annually
6507238 with demand from china still increasing and the emergence of rich new markets elsewhere in asia our outlook is for that pace of growth to continue for the foreseeable future
6507239 over 99 percent of the voters had absolutely no problem complying with the new law during the 2006 election
6507240 proposition 200 enhances the accuracy of arizonas voter rolls and ensures that the rights of lawful voters are not debased by unlawfully cast ballots
6507241 does not qualify as a substantial burden on the right to vote or even represent a significant increase over the usual burdens of voting
6507242 even if everyone prevented from registering by proposition 200 was allowed to register the percentage of the electorate that was latino would only increase by 0 1 percent
6507243 could have been driven at least in part by the lower latino population growth in 2005 2006
6507244 as a result over 99 percent of the voters had absolutely no problem complying with the new law during the 2006 election
6507245 these are our people our countrymen and their commitment to mexico is vital to this country
6507246 he wants us to send more money well get us more jobs

6507251 there is no consistency they want migrants to invest in mexico but we cant get a legal id

6507257 we did six dates earlier this year and it wasnt enough
6507258 obama engaged in deal with convicted felon to get deal on house that had four fireplaces and a wine cellar
6507259 two years ago obama bought a mansion on the south side in the kenwood neighborhood from a doctor on the same day antoin tony rezkos wife rita rezko bought the vacant lot next door from the same seller the doctor had listed the properties for sale together he sold the house to obama for 300 000 below the asking price the doctor got his asking price on the lot from rezkos wife
6507260 on the same day obama closed on his house rezkos wife bought the adjacent empty lot meeting the condition of the seller who wanted to sell both properties at the same time
6507261 later the obamas bought a 10 foot by 150 foot piece of the lot for 104 500 an appraisal put the value of the strip at 40 500 a spokesman said but obama considered it fair to pay one sixth of the original price for one sixth of the lot
6507262 a federal jury today convicted developer antoin tony rezko of corruption charges for trading on his clout as a top adviser and fundraiser to gov rod blagojevich rezkos guilty verdict on 16 of 24 corruption counts could have broad repercussions for blagojevich who made rezko a central player in his kitchen cabinet it could also prove a political liability for u s sen barack obama who once counted rezko as a friend and fundraiser as the likely democratic presidential nominee heads into the general election campaign against republican john mccain the jury convicted rezko of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery he was acquitted of attempted extortion
6507263 when obama and his wife michelle a hospital executive decided to move with their two young girls from their hyde park condominium they chose a spacious three story georgian revival home on a tree lined street in the kenwood neighborhood not far from the university of chicago the owner had listed the house nearly 100 years old with four fireplaces and a wine cellar and an adjacent lot as separate parcels
6507264 as a state senator barack obama wrote letters to city and state officials supporting his political patron tony rezkos successful bid to get more than 14 million from taxpayers to build apartments for senior citizens
6507265 obamas letters written nearly nine years ago for the first time show the democratic presidential hopeful did a political favor for rezko a longtime friend campaign fund raiser and client of the law firm where obama worked who was indicted last fall on federal charges that accuse him of demanding kickbacks from companies seeking state business under gov blagojevich
6507266 the letters appear to contradict a statement last december from obama who told the chicago tribune that in all the years hes known rezko ive never done any favors for him
6507267 one of them was sen barack obama d ill who was offered a job by rezko in the early 1990s while a top student at harvard law school obama did not take it but over the years the two men stayed in touch
6507268 for the first time sen barack obama put a figure friday to the amount of campaign contributions that indicted political fund raiser tony rezko raised for the senators campaigns and the number about 250 000 was far more than he previously acknowledged
6507269 wed obama and rezko continue to have lunches or breakfasts wed talk about politics wed talk about family
6507270 in terms of other than lunch or breakfast he and i had socially michelle and i probably had a couple of dinners or two or three dinners with rezko and his wife during the course of this six or seven or eight years
6507271 this set was built exactly 20 minutes before i walked on to it to shoot

6507289 the first and only statuette of her kind before the french venus of lespugue and the russian venus of kostienki joined her two decades later the lady from willendorf still attracts crowds
6507290 i think a lot of visitors come to the museum just to see the venus
6507291 we cant prove that women played a predominant role during this period and that these female statuettes honoured them there are many other statuettes from that period representing animals part humans and part animals or asexual human beings

6507479 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands odi squad for the natwest series after careful consideration
6507480 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6507481 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6507482 now that my family is settled and my bowling is settled i feel i have something to offer englands odi side and am looking forward to playing a part in the natwest series against south africa
6507483 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room
6507484 with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this upcoming natwest series then im happy to do just that
6507485 at the moment my focus is on doing well in the odis against south africa and im not looking beyond that at this stage
6507486 if history is a guide the u s economy is probably at the brink of a turning point in inflation

6507510 true enough greg but this piece of news youre sharing here that we now know first well not to be too blunt but its a bit anti climactic
6507511 with the kind of patient sympathy often shown to me by christians who cant quite understand why the good news of jesus death and resurrection has not reached me or my people
6507512 what i simply do not understand is why they are often so angry
6507513 when you know the truth it is inconceivable to feel threatened by a lie
6507514 to put it in perpective are you threatened by the idea that the earth is flat
6507515 but to be technical about it its not a lie
6507516 when large groups of people wish to teach flat earth ideas in our public schools and call it science then well find it threatening
6507517 dont listen to that atheist hes angry emotional he just doesnt make sense
6507518 the mere existence of religion for dawkins is threatening and hed much rather it go away

6507520 dont listen to that atheist hes angry emotional he just doesnt make sense

6507523 whether its the home cooked meals that give parents more time with children or the warm welcoming environment that helps families relax ronald mcdonald houses provide families with comfort in every sense of the word
6507524 la z boy furniture has been synonymous with comfort for north american families for decades and we hope that it can bring a small sense of serenity to the families of rmhc too
6507525 we are proud to be associated with the la z boy brand which has been a symbol of comfort and support for more than eight decades
6507526 rmhc wouldnt be where it is today if it werent for the support of corporate donors ronald mcdonald house charities and its network of local chapters is projected to grow its programs by 37 percent by 2010 and we couldnt do that without the generous contributions of time money and in kind donations from companies like la z boy their furniture will bring comfort to families every night who are experiencing some of the most stressful times of their lives rmhc is a global organization and our corporate donors allow us to directly impact children and families on a local level
6507527 comfort is more than a tagline at la z boy its a commitment the true value of this partnership goes beyond the furniture we will provide and extends into the local support fundraising and volunteerism we will offer the individual ronald mcdonald houses and their participating families who are so in need of compassionate care

6507529 there is a tidal wave of new capital projects around the globe which has put immense pressure on delivery times and has caused construction costs to skyrocket in addition brownfield operations have to contend with limited resources for proper maintenance of their assets in both cases lack of care in managing asset information the virtual asset leads to poor performance of physical and human assets
6507530 the current costs of poor asset information management are staggering throughout the asset lifecycle the performance of large scale capital projects and operating facilities are all hindered for example collaboration across global design and build teams handover of information to owner operators for better operations and maintenance management of change and information quality safety and compliance and the general ability to deliver the right information to the right people at the right time are all compromised better aim is a prerequisite not a nice to have to deal with the need to manage assets in a safe effective and efficient manner across the entire asset lifecycle the time to act is now
6507531 ultimately the lack of complete accurate and timely asset information leads to delays budget overruns poor reliability low productivity and supply chain inefficiencies
6507532 in todays business environment this can be the difference between business success and failure businesses need to invest in specific technologies to improve their operations for instance companies implementing an effective aim solution such as nrx asset center are able to improve quality and efficiency and dramatically reduce the risk of scheduling delays and cost overruns sap and nrx are working closely with our customers to tackle these challenges this ensures that the facilities can perform the way that the business expects
6507533 if users have to access multiple systems to do their jobs too much energy is drained and roi is diminished as solution providers we have to provide users with a seamless experience
6507534 the ability to merge content and data in a common workflow is a powerful business process enabler open text and nrx are working together to enable critical processes such as management of change moc and deliver a compelling experience to a broad spectrum of shop floor users
6507535 asset integrity is mission critical and accurate asset information is essential to the assurance of asset integrity this information which includes asset equipment hierarchies functional locations tags maintenance task lists maintenance plans and bills of materials must be sustained for the life of all assets
6507536 owner operators face many challenges in managing asset information data handover from engineering partners and oem suppliers often falls short where oem amp epc data formats and levels of detail differ from owner operator requirements for plant operations maintenance aim solutions such as nrx asset center support the operations readiness team by enabling automation of manual processes including loading of asset master data into the maintenance management system sap pm in our case in addition the operations maintenance team must review and assure the quality of critical asset information periodically throughout the life of every asset to sustain asset integrity solutions such as nrx provide support to such reviews enabling rigorous management of sap pm master data changes
6507537 large capital projects are faced with many challenges including distributed execution and labor shortages bechtels information management goal is to provide a project services network to the distributed team members and joint venture partners around the globe using only an internet connection and a browser
6507538 owner operators are demanding project information as a continuous deliverable in the capital project cycle the dump truck paradigm of handing over information at the end of the project is no longer acceptable
6507539 we have to provide a high quality flow of information from the beginning our project services network is leveraging solutions such as nrx asset center to serve as the project data hub which allows us to define better requirements collaborate with our suppliers and provide real time handover of information to our customers
6507540 from prior experience we have learned that aim solutions are essential enablers of user adoption and business process compliance
6507541 to ensure achievement of these factors we co developed business processes with over 100 people globally and built cross functional teams that spanned all units we are supporting these new processes by leveraging user friendly nrx solutions and end user knowledge and feedback throughout the projects
6507542 without the proper processes tools and controls in place from day one of go live data quality can quickly become an issue for example whether in big bang or incremental projects companies should start data collection and clean up prior to go live so their asset and document management systems are populated with comprehensive and accurate data and documents aim solutions reduce the time and cost incurred searching for and managing asset information and benefits are magnified if aim solutions are applied across all plants and business units
6507543 industry leaders are increasingly recognizing aim as an extremely important enabler of capital project delivery and asset performance this annual forum reflects increasing recognition of aim as a strategic imperative a growing community of owner operators and their partners are implementing practical and innovative aim solutions across the asset lifecycle we have come a long way in realizing the potential of aim across an enterprise
6507544 however the full aim vision will only be realized through cooperation within this community nrx is working closely with all stakeholders including owner operators engineering companies suppliers and solution partners such as sap and open text to address the compelling need of our customers for an end to end solution for aim
6507545 there was an altercation involving an unknown male who obviously threw something through a window
6507546 there was a smash it the object must have been alight because it ignited the curtains and the house went up
6507547 i was there eight minutes later and it was just destroyed

6507549 they went back in to retrieve the woman couldnt find her and they found she gained access to the rear of the premises and was in the back yard
6507550 we wont know what he threw through the window until the forensics get there we dont know if he had some sort of accelerant or if things just went up themselves

6507578 i saw what andrew did in our family i saw that he came in and listened and watched and understood who we were each individual one of us he tried to discover our need and then supply it he took responsibility for other people and it didnt seem to matter to him how much it cost him and in the end while he could never make the ribeira family normal he gave us peace and pride and identity stability he married mother and was kind to her he loved us all he was always there when we wanted him and seemed unhurt by it when we didnt he was firm with us about expecting civilized behavior but never indulged his whims at our expense and i thought this is so much more important than science or politics either or any particular profession or accomplishment or thing you can make i thought if i could just make a good family if i could just learn to be to other children their whole lives what andrew was coming so late into ours then that would mean more in the long run it would be a finer accomplishment than anything i could ever do with my mind or hands

6507591 for the first time this pacific islands forum has condemned directly the actions of bainimarama in failing to honour his undertakings to the pacific island leaders a year or so ago

6507593 we are dealing with very difficult entrenched problems in fijian politics and this is a very hard nut to crack

6507595 the maps are only available if you have geographic information software and you have to buy the maps and this is very much on purpose because the real estate industry local developers local counties and cities who want to promote growth dont want people to know where the dangerous areas are
6507596 one is money putting together something like that is an expensive proposition but something that were working on for example if you live in oregon city and you live in a landside area you can actually go to our website put in your address and put in a layer over it that gives landslides for the oregon city area and look and see if your home is in a landslide prone area so were moving toward that but its a lengthy process
6507597 its not necessarily that theres a conspiracy to withhold this information its just that the technology wasnt there the law wasnt written as well as it could have been the things that the law was going to trigger were going to be burdens for communities to have to live with so fast forward to now where were working with oregon city to develop these maps and even looking at susceptibility maps so that were going to be able to go to oregon city and says that you have your areas of your community that are much more susceptible to landslides to others the real estate people arent going to like but its reality
6507598 you can come to the salem city hall to the community development department
6507599 go to the permit application center we have a planning information desk thats staffed all the time 8 to 5 five days a week including the lunch hour and you can ask the planner on duty to tell you whether or not the home that youre interested in is in a landslide hazard area and what the planner will do is take the address that you give them put it in a computer and our geographic information system has a layer of information for landslide hazard areas and it will pop up

6507633 september is a great time for even more people to get ready because it is the height of hurricane and flash flood season in the commonwealth
6507634 i like that there anna faris why isnt she a bigger star
6507635 que indica pausa mais forte que a da v rgula e menos que a do ponto
6507636 el precio que se establezca para la compra de las acciones deber someterse a la aprobaci n del congreso
6507637 la intervenci n de la auditor a general de la naci n y solicitar informer a cualquier otro organismo
6507638 delay doesnt work as a tactic i want them to come in quickly and resolve this expeditiously
6507639 the main point is the timing of how quickly they offer the buy backs to the investors
6507640 we want that done quickly and they had a voluntary time frame that was not acceptable
6507641 some messages were not being received everybody was speaking over them
6507642 it was very very important that the building had not been inspected and we will deal with that
6507643 and probably thought he still had enough to get to the perimeter and get out
6507644 were having trouble getting up from the stairwells they have everything boarded up and blocked off
6507645 oil is the driver and then it depends on a series of other factors that are kind of like magnifiers
6507646 all three reports tend to indicate that were bottoming out but that there is no real end in sight and thats what i think the market has to get used to
6507647 people are finally realizing that this russian situation has the potential to be bad for a very long time
6507648 the russians have shown evidence that theyre willing to cut off energy supplies to advance their aims there is concern that they are now going to be much more assertive in that area
6507649 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6507650 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop we may be a few cents away from the august bottom
6507651 the slide in the dollar has taken some of the wind out of the bears sail in the energy complex
6507652 terrified of allowing western countries to build any kind of cushion for the unexpected because it has the potential to return prices to normal or sustainable economic levels
6507653 obwohl das flugzeug offensichtlich fehlerhaft war ist es mit meiner siebenj hrigen nichte gestartet
6507654 wir glauben dass russland auf die georgische provokation reagiert hat
6507655 then why all the rush to interpolated 120hz 100hz pal for home movie display
6507656 live big screen video using hand held cameras would be inadequate at 48p
6507657 is that why they all walk out on 60 hz hdtv oh wait they dont
6507658 i thought the audience walked out on the high film frame rate because it was too realistic now youre saying they cant tell the difference must have been an audience of supermen eh
6507659 the point where you cant tell the difference anymore is somewhere over 72 fps
6507660 personally i hate the jerky 24 fps film look id take 60 or 72 fps any day
6507661 flicker is noticed more with computer displays due to the white sheet of paper model flat white areas appear to flicker more than dark
6507662 another movie he directed brainstorm was originally designed to highlight a projection technology he was promoting the movie was about recording experiences in the film the recorded experiences were going to be played at 48 frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames per second his feeling was that audiences had gotten used to the look of standard film people were subliminally aware of the 24 frame per second flicker by projecting the film at twice the standard rate the flicker was harder to perceive and the film would be given that much more immediacy however it was impossible to convince the theater owners to install the special projectors to show the recorded experience sequences the movie was released as a conventional film fortunately the story stood up well on its own partly correct showscan runs at 60fps when he was doing test work for 2001 i believe it was on the spacewalk footage but its been years since i read up on the process and things have blurred for me he accidentally ran a sequence at 60fps and the uniform reaction in the booth was shock that hed gotten a 3d effect with a conventional camera he did dream up brainstorm to use the process but the studio hed been working with didnt want to install the only projector on the market that would run 60fps for an extended period without breaking for just one film and he ended up taking the story idea with him to mgm as i remember it he had to do a sizable payout to get it from his previous studio even then mgm wouldnt go for it compare and contrast with the ua chain which installed a highly sophisticated 3d system in a number of their theaters including seattle and ended up offering a couple of million dollars as a bounty to get someone anyone to shoot a feature using it there were several showscan shorts shot the one at expo 86 the one on magic tricks starring christopher lee and it looked like hed finally get them in widespread distribution when he signed a deal with a major restaurant chain to add a showscan theater to each of their restaurants but the chain was chuck e cheese and the deal was about two months before they imploded of all the reviews i read about the process the one that stuck with me was the one in cinefantastique that said makeup technology was going to have to improve greatly if the process was going to catch on you could apparently see every pore on christopher lees face
6507663 after the semis i knew i would run a personal best
6507664 i had a strategy i stuck to it and now im an olympic champion
6507665 people say if it hits your hand you should have it
6507666 to come in two and three is good for me
6507667 dayron is a great 110 meter hurdler probably one of the best of all time for me and david to come in right behind him is an honor
6507668 its interesting because everyone says all the time that we win and no one can compete
6507669 it was proven today that other teams can win the sport should remain its global its been a beautiful last two weeks of softball
6507670 i have to really take my hat off to her
6507671 if we had the olympics tomorrow it would still make it hard to lose
6507672 i believe we have created a historical breakthrough with this game
6507673 we tried our best but we lack some things compared to the americans
6507674 i cant imagine what london will be like with these guys
6507675 we found our rhythm once we started to slow things down
6507676 anyway i think its possible to beat them the difference was that in the world championship when we defeated them we were focused the whole match but not today it wasnt our day
6507677 we werent making any shots but once we settled in we got the job done
6507678 we still had a bad shooting night but we did a good job defensively
6507679 once i stood on that platform i was concentrated into the competition and didnt think much about it
6507680 we are over the moon that the team will be back at home
6507681 people living near the club have had to put up with such a lot and the site has really deteriorated over the years but they will be playing the first home game of the season on saturday and it is fantastic
6507682 sie haben uns ber die entscheidung des russischen verteidigungsministeriums informiert die milit rische zusammenarbeit mit den nato staaten bis auf weiteres auszusetzen
6507683 nicht so tun als sei nichts geschehen so lange georgien noch von russischen truppen besetzt ist
6507684 uns k me eine niederlage der nato in afghanistan nicht gelegen
6507685 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
6507686 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
6507687 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
6507688 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
6507689 weve had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation
6507690 he couldnt count high enough apparently to even know how many houses he owns
6507691 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6507692 the other night i was with a group of people and the fastest thing to do was to get on the bus some of these people had never been on a bus as if this was some awful low class way
6507693 people who wouldnt normally take the bus they can see this beautiful piece of art here and want to take public transportation
6507694 we as an industry need to repaint the picture and make it attractive
6507695 and we dont have a lot of time to be building things
6507696 with the launch of the entrepreneurial institute we continue to support the significant growth of african american businesses by offering resources for existing business owners small business professionals and aspiring entrepreneurs
6507697 with our recent multi million dollar mall renovations and the many fabulous premier fashion retailers that have opened at square one recently we felt it was an opportune time to bring back a fashion show event
6507698 square one has always been an active supporter of many charitable initiatives and sponsorships over the years and we couldnt think of a better way to give back to our community than by donating proceeds from ticket sales to the credit valley hospitals new diagnostic assessment unit
6507699 were absolutely delighted for chez when we first met him monday night we had no idea what a great week he had in store for us we certainly could never have scripted a better story
6507700 the exposure on cbs television over the weekend and in the daily newspapers across the united states and canada is a huge boost for us especially as we look to expand significantly into the us marketplace for 2009
6507701 bobby and geoff sent me a few samples and i immediately liked what i saw
6507702 its very comfortable its stylish and it stands out and thats what i was looking for i saw a lot of people wearing quagmire at the open and when they saw me wearing it i think they really got a kick out of it
6507703 we started this company as two young canadian guys looking to change the trends in golf fashion
6507704 we were tired of our boring golf duds and decided to create chilled lifestyle wear we create styles for the young at heart golfers who above all have a love for the game and want to reflect this in their image our line fits the 18 hole dress code but works right into the 19th hole lifestyle
6507705 the scoreboard has to tell the story of the tournament
6507706 and it has to be clear and simple so people can read it
6507707 its simply another tool to be manipulated by the artist
6507708 its just so exciting to be part of professional golf tournaments
6507709 and this calligraphy is just a wonderful thing to do
6507710 if you buy one theatre ticket this summer make it this one a thrilling hurtling triumph
6507711 i grew up in mississauga meadowvale to be exact and trained at the dance factory under the instruction of cindy dalzell for almost 10 years
6507712 it was great to have the extra outlet and a totally different perspective on dance we were exposed to performances at the hummingbird centre and even got the opportunity to perform there with the late gregory hines
6507713 id won a scholarship from triple threat dance convention a b c dance school which came with an opportunity to work for the cruise line
6507714 the dancing in the show is timeless its some of the most challenging work that i have ever done i am also understudying the role of rosalia which allows me to work on a challenging vocal role touring europe is something that i have always wanted to do and it has proven to be worth it
6507715 i always try to push myself to the next level with every role that im fortunate to perform i dont know what i would do if i didnt dance the business can be very challenging at times but i think that perseverance and staying true to yourself are the most important tools to have in show business
6507716 i understand the joy but you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6507717 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6507718 which hasnt been officially announced it will be released in 2010
6507719 its a real lush thick record it has a lot of different flavors
6507720 i think its a real good balance of progressive kind of cutting edge drum and bass stuff with a combination of that roots flavor that people come to know and expect from jbb
6507721 the bands gone through a lot some of it very tragic and some of it very necessary and inevitable
6507722 right now the band is really focused were having a lot of fun touring together and i think that shows in the music and comes across onstage more than ever
6507723 theres a lot of baggage that goes along with reggae
6507724 the stereotypes are many sitting on the beach drinking fruity cocktails thats never the kind of vibe i got into with reggae i was always into the really conscious heavy political minor key stuff like burning spear and the abbyssinians and thats the stuff that got me really interested in it every music has their stereotypes and people try to put a box around it these days and my job as a musician is to get outside of that
6507725 weve always loved that tune and thought it really fit the vibe of the band and where were at right now
6507726 its an honor to play that song and we tried to do it justice the whole point was to not make it sound like the original version at all
6507727 when i hear it i think of armies rolling over mountains trying to invade crush and destroy
6507728 the guy never wrote a bad song thats a tough question

6507730 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6507731 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6507732 these children have a very serious infection that is causing tissue necrosis the death of the tissue
6507733 its not like it is in older children and adults where its generally an invasive group a strep but indeed it is a necrotizing tissue destroying infection that theyve got
6507734 the review has not in any way turned up anything that would cause concern for mothers to be and the lethbridge region
6507735 if we had any concerns that there was something related to the hospital its dr mustos responsibility to shut the hospital down
6507736 in this particular incidence weve not been able to uncover the source of the infection
6507737 because its such an unusual event that there is two of these children that have such a significant infection we thought it wise to ask for another review of this and this is normal practice
6507738 because of the privacy act we need a formally signed consent form from the parents to release any information about the condition of the children
6507739 we dont have that and i dont think were going to be getting it
6507740 foster stability in this region which is vulnerable to political and economic pressures from the south north and east
6507741 the humiliation that nato expansion bred in russia was critical in fueling putins rise after boris yeltsin moved on
6507742 and americas addiction to oil helped push up energy prices to a level that gave putin the power to act on that humiliation
6507743 when you talk to all the detractors whose critique is that starbucks ruined the culture of coffeehouses youd get the impression there were all these coffeehouses and then starbucks came in and destroyed them

6507750 now where could it be i saw it here before
6507751 i was wasted pissing in a beer bottle on the side of the street the cops ran up to me as they ran over i made a desperate move and put the bottle to my mouth and pretend it was a beer as my own warm piss hit my face the cops asked me if i was pissing on the street i said no they looked on the ground and saw no piss the cops didnt look in the bottle assumed it was beer and i escape certain arrest
6507752 streets became rivers cars were underwater and the bumps we hit on the water in our boats were the windshields of cars
6507753 these are the kind of experiences life is all about
6507754 yo i just spent the last fuckin five minutes on bourbon st trying to put a fuckin plastic hand grenade around my necklace hey here they are put it on the blog this is geoff
6507755 the funniest part about this to me is that you tried to pass it off on geoff
6507756 dont call the strippers whores in new orleans or tell the bouncers to go fuck themselves they dont like that very much there
6507757 if you ever do that again i will punch you in the face
6507758 no thats not it damn it where do i know you guys from
6507759 i love abortions too does anyone need one ill do it with my fucking thumb right now
6507760 participants argued that with the implementation of a modern social protection system the need for rice price stabilization and rice distribution will diminish over time
6507761 development partners highlighted the merits of expanding the conditional cash transfer program cct and emphasized the importance of establishing a solid targeting system for the cct which could also be used to target other pro poor programs
6507762 the meeting acknowledged that the cct has the potential to boost the millennium development goals as well as directly fight poverty and inequality noting that sustained investment in the program could alleviate future economic shocks to the poor
6507763 it was argued that such measures would even backfire as lower revenue effort could undo some of the gains that the philippines has reaped from past fiscal and economic reforms

6507770 whenever theres a corrupt system then youre going to have these birds of prey descend on it to get their share of the spoils
6507771 but the fact is that they are the symptom of a disease
6507772 as long as you have earmarking and pork barrel spending and bridges to nowhere and money for dna of bears in montana and museums and all that then youre going to have lobbyists
6507773 lobbying is an honorable profession i have no problem with it i have no problem with people working in order to bring the peoples interests and agenda and priorities to the attention of congress almost all of us who i know of rely on their input on various issues many supply us with policy papers with data et cetera
6507774 im going to thank some corrupt unscrupulous lobbyists that are destroying america as we speak everything we stand for and believe in
6507775 mccain there are too many lobbyists in washington but 160 of them run my campaign

6507808 the airport seem to think they can develop the site without submitting an official application were concerned that it could slip through the back door and its a development by stealth
6507809 youre going to have to get pertinacious about this one
6507810 you dont half have to show some pertinacity to get on these new kidney drugs
6507811 drivers need to be warned about the bridge but that many is just ridiculous and surely no heavy goods vehicle driver would attempt to take a lorry down the lanes
6507812 the signs just clutter up a really picturesque area and at night when the car lights shine on them they light up like blackpool illuminations
6507813 new weight restriction signs have been installed on the approaches to lock gate canal bridge by our contractors enterprise to draw attention to the fact that the bridge is weak and subject to a 10 tonne weight restriction
6507814 unfortunately this bridge which has a very steep hump back and is a listed building has a past record of large vehicles grounding upon it and causing severe damage the new signs are an attempt to prevent this happening again
6507815 the intention is to establish office space that could be used as a temporary meeting place for members of the public or other interested groups to discuss by prior appointment the instability issues in the ironbridge gorge away from the present construction site
6507816 the change of use will bring lloyds cottage back into practical use and the council believes lloyds cottage will be a valuable resource
6507817 the parish council has got no objections to the planning application its best that it is brought into use rather than left to go derelict
6507818 any use of a building that will help a community is good
6507819 if you drive your vehicle on a road you have a responsibility to ensure everything about the vehicle and yourself is legal
6507820 throughout the force we have automatic number plate readers which enable police officers to check on the legality of vehicles within seconds
6507821 should you not have the correct documents you risk having your vehicle seized and potentially crushed
6507822 you will also be prosecuted for the offences you have committed and could then end up with a substantial fine and points

6507826 he has lots of experience at the top level and his international record is phenomenal
6507827 we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
6507828 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
6507829 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6507830 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6507831 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to george bush
6507832 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6507833 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6507834 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6507835 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6507836 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today
6507837 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6507838 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have different perspective
6507839 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime
6507840 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6507841 if the problem is only moisture blemishes white rings white fog etc then it is a simple matter of moisture trapped inside the finish itself a quick simple method of removing excess moisture from a wood finish is your hair dryer no sanding no chemicals no mess just apply some warm air to the surface to help the moisture evaporate do not let it blow continuously in one spot the surface could get too hot the idea is to help the moisture evaporate not damage the finish

6507844 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession

6508028 her public position and the symbol of this chair are in direct conflict
6508029 this chair is a powerful visible symbol of roman catholic theology and in roman catholic theology abortion is disallowed
6508030 it appears to me that some right wing group has put pressure on the university
6508031 shes done seminal work on christian feminism social justice and the relationship between religion and ecology
6508032 this is a woman who is in favor of abortion in favor of contraception homosexuality and women priests

6508034 rosemary ruether is like the godmother of the feminist theologian movement
6508035 its just criminal to disinvite her from the university of san diego
6508036 any appeal to the principle of academic freedom in order to justify positions that contradict the faith and the teaching of the church would obstruct or even betray the universitys identity and mission
6508037 im openly gay and im teaching at a jesuit institution
6508038 as a catholic institution for higher education our understanding of ourselves is that we are to uphold the churchs teachings on abortion and other subjects as the holy father calls for
6508039 chair holders are to be distinguished theologians who think from within the roman catholic tradition while exploring and expressing the tradition in contemporary contexts

6508046 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
6508047 in fact i am quite broadminded but this is completely inappropriate for children i bought the book for my niece as a present and was reading it when i came across the word
6508048 the book has an attractive cover and is clearly for children they should not have to be subjected to trash and vulgarity
6508049 i did not expect this from a well respected author and do not want my young niece to have to see this obscene slang
6508050 she comes to visit me regularly and we read to each other
6508051 we have all the enid blyton books such as the famous five and secret seven and had finished all of them
6508052 i thought i would get her something a little more modern and had heard about jacqueline wilson through the popular tracy beaker television series
6508053 i got to the page where reference was made to a toffee nosed twit
6508054 on the next page the word changed i thought i was mistaken but then i saw to my shock it had been repeated twice again
6508055 i asked her if she was aware of this word and if she could do something about it
6508056 i would like her to explain how she would want me to explain this to my daughter even if it is in the context of the character
6508057 in the context of the character we felt it was used in a way that accurately portrayed how children like jodie would speak to each other
6508058 the book is aimed at children aged ten and over and we felt it was acceptable for that age range
6508059 however in light of this response we have decided to amend the word when we reprint the book
6508060 since the book was launched in march this year we have sold over 28 000 copies and this is the first complaint we have had jacqueline wilson books are extremely popular with our customers and are the top selling childrens books in most high street stores

6508151 we have children getting killed by gang leaders and dope dealers we have real issues here in this city
6508152 its got to be through relationships handing out religious tracts would not go over well at all that would be like me walking around with a free tibet flag
6508153 if foreigners do such things in china they violate the law and local religious departments and other departments should stop them
6508154 they looked for opportunities to talk to the locals and share about their faith
6508155 our goal was wanting to communicate the love of god to people not be overt
6508156 it was almost like they were treating us like criminals
6508157 we thought wed stay away from beijing we honestly didnt come here to cause trouble
6508158 when you assign a chaplain its almost like saying were bringing a team to china and assigning the coach well the coach doesnt know the players and only knows the sport we feel the spiritual realm is the same way
6508159 could lead to net national employment losses of up to 4 million jobs electricity price increases of up to 129 percent gasoline price increases of up to 145 percent and a loss of household income of up to 6 752 per year
6508160 i put shows on in england eight nine 10 years ago and we were lucky to get 700 people to come out
6508161 cage rage came along over there and they got a lot of people out but that was just the tip of the iceberg
6508162 the ufc has been very successful with their shows over there and i think its a matter of time before that starts mushrooming there is just as much interest in this sport internationally as there is here and so it has this unbelievable growth potential
6508163 there isnt a lot of interpretation that needs to go into explaining a fight
6508164 lets be honest its a dangerous sport but the track record when it comes to safety is so good that i dont think you could dare tinker with the rules in any meaningful way because of that
6508165 because of the great officiating we have and the great set of rules we have our serious injury rate is so low
6508166 i think this is going to go the way of hbo and showtime
6508167 and its going to really be prevalent there will still be room for pay per view but the entire business isnt going to be based around pay per view like it has been
6508168 gsp is the perfect example of what youll see coming
6508169 were not far away from the time when you quit thinking of a guy as a wrestler or a jiu jitsu guy and you see them as mixed martial artists because theyll have learned mma from the start
6508170 youve started to see these mixed martial arts gyms popping up over the last five years and that will be the norm going forward
6508171 the kids are starting out much much younger than we started and theyre getting all of their information and all of their techniques at one place
6508172 its going to be better for them because its very difficult for someone who has worked in one sport for years and years and years and has learned that sports fundamentals and has its own way of doing things to kind of pick up the other disciplines that have very different techniques
6508173 its very new and very awkward for a wrestler after all those years of those wrestling drills to feel comfortable fighting off of his back
6508174 its going to be new and not natural to him learning the striking game is new throwing punches and kicks just learning each different discipline is a whole new idea
6508175 but then theres the whole idea of putting that into the whole concept of mixed martial arts
6508176 there is a lot of adjusting and adapting you need to do with each art and you really have to put it in the concept of mixed martial arts
6508177 thats something a lot of fighters still struggle with now but when they learn this all from the beginning its going to be as natural as a shot is for someone who is a trained wrestler
6508178 i remember a few years ago when ex referee big john mccarthy was on friends that was a big deal for us in this sport
6508179 its pretty commonplace now but the next thing will be when nike goes after one of our superstars and no i dont mean kimbo slice and signs him to a lucrative deal i think that day is very quickly coming
6508180 i had to come out here and do my part
6508181 everybodys just having fun and working as hard as they can out there
6508182 it doesnt matter how big or small the nation is
6508183 when you put jamaicans in an environment like this only good things happen
6508184 weve been saying it but i dont think anyones been taking us seriously i guess they are now
6508185 its interesting because everyone says all the time that we win and nobody can compete
6508186 i dont do anything else this is my life so its frustrating theyre taking this out of the olympics but japans victory shows that it can be any teams game
6508187 you dont want it to end this way but its all we could do
6508188 it hurts a lot you train your whole life and you want to win you dont expect to lose
6508189 the game has changed and the way the game is played has to be changed
6508190 ahh so this is how the hardcore were when they were young
6508191 in the contract with the two world records maybe we can pay 30 000 more
6508192 for us it is very important he is the superstar of the olympic games and we expect to fill all the stadium with people coming to see usain bolt
6508193 i still think he has the potential to improve the 100 by quite a bit to get it to the same level he is running the 200
6508194 there is of course a very nice bonus available if you run a world record in zurich
6508195 i think zurich is probably the most advanced track there is in the world
6508196 it needs time to settle in so we expect the track to be in better condition for the athletes than last year
6508197 as per the arrangement customers who hold a credit card of any of these banks can avail iphone without any down payment and at a rate which will be significantly below the interest rates charged for credit cards or personal loans
6508198 jake shields and paul daley have a date on oct 4
6508199 both fighters have verbally agreed bout agreements are out and were just waiting for them to come back in
6508200 unlike some others these are two guys that i trust their word
6508201 we faxed over a contract to noons people and he has until 5 p m pacific time on thursday to sign it and get it back to us or theyll be forcing our hand
6508202 there are several options were considering right now gannon is not the guy
6508203 in the contract with the two world records maybe we can pay 30 000 more
6508204 for us it is very important he is the superstar of the olympic games and we expect to fill all the stadium with people coming to see usain bolt
6508205 i still think he has the potential to improve the 100 by quite a bit to get it to the same level he is running the 200
6508206 there is of course a very nice bonus available if you run a world record in zurich
6508207 i think zurich is probably the most advanced track there is in the world
6508208 it needs time to settle in so we expect the track to be in better condition for the athletes than last year
6508209 this was a fantastic performance by both olive and robbie and the scale of what they have achieved shouldnt be underestimated they are now in the same company as the likes of john treacy eamonn coghlan and sonia osullivan
6508210 irish race walking has benefitted in recent years from the professional approach within its own ranks and exemplifies what can be achieved with a high level results oriented attitude
6508211 we launched the mizuno mile series in 2007 and it was so successful that we are repeating the series this year the senior events include internationals who just missed out on a place in team gb for beijing and have had to pick themselves up after the disappointment of missing the games stormont is a fabulous location for the mile the fast course and lovely surroundings we hope the course record set last year at 354 will be revised julian continues the event starts at 7 15pm with the fun run for children and adults the elite races will be run at 8pm everyone is encouraged to come along for the evening a mile is a nice distance that almost anyone can jog or run

6508215 some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them others are poor if theyre billionaires
6508216 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6508217 i voted for you in the primary youre going to win
6508218 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species
6508219 and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques
6508220 in light of our new findings the pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies
6508221 this smithsonian contribution to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions is a direct result of catherine potvins foresight in adapting her studies of plant carbon uptake to panamas cultural and economic reality and represents a very positive step in support of our basic research on the impact of global change on tropical forests and water availability and our climate partnership with hsbc the world wildlife fund earthwatch and the climate group
6508222 i hope that our model for community based carbon offset will show that the carbon market can directly benefit local people while helping panama to remain an international leader in the global effort to reduce emissions from deforestation under the united nations framework convention for climate change
6508223 as the community replants deforested areas with native species we replant traditions vital to the conservation of our way of life this is a very positive step toward confronting the ongoing devastation of natural resources and protecting the environment in the region

6508228 even though its easy to lose your temper at bristol i love racing there
6508229 its a fast track that always produces great racing for
6508230 you just have to realize that more than likely youre going to make someone mad or youre going to get mad at someone else you cant help it youre turning 500 laps around the place thats a lot of time to get into it with someone
6508231 im looking forward to bristol because ive had some success there and its good short track racing
6508232 although i like racing at the michigans and atlantas because they are fast and you can choose your groove ive grown up racing at short tracks and just like them we did good last time at bristol so hopefully we can be consistent and finish next weekend out from start to finish
6508233 i think its just a track that fits his style
6508234 it takes a rhythm and its fast paced hes raced there a ton of laps on simulation and i think it just fits his driving style weve run good there ever since we were in the busch cars weve always run really well there weve won one time but it just seems like weve had really good cars just not capitalized on them
6508235 i just pay extra attention and keep my eyes open i have to make sure i watch dale jr and at least half the track in front of him because he will be there in a matter of seconds dale jr is good at bristol and to be honest its really fun to watch him there he is good at making holes for himself its fun working with someone who knows his way around there
6508236 it will definitely be hotter so you really have to pay attention to the grip level of the car during practice

6508252 33 the controversy surrounding the skunkiness that comes from green bottles and life in general
6508253 he is talking to nbc next week and we are working out everyones schedule i dont want to put him in just for the sake of having him drop by i want there to be a good reason for him being there and have it be part of the story i talked to david about a way of doing that and so far he likes it its a cool idea
6508254 he doesnt feel that way anymore i just talked with david the other day over breakfast at the beverly hills hotel and explained to him in great detail what we had planned for the show and he said he liked it and gave his approval
6508255 which hasnt been officially announced it will be released in 2010
6508256 there are a couple of things he can do and a couple of things he cant do
6508257 i do not want to insinuate with him that hes not a tough guy or has to play injured he has to have some of his faculties hes got to be able to protect himself thats usually the biggest factor that we look at are we putting a guy in peril does he have to play the game a different way can he protect himself we just need to make sure that he can
6508258 you would like to see that next step in progress but you have to balance that with is it the prudent thing to do and can he protect himself im not going to sacrifice one for the other
6508259 there are a couple of things he can do and a couple of things he cant do
6508260 there are a couple of things he can do and a couple million things he cant do

6508262 michel is one of my greatest friends its an honour to be in the same category as him its going to take some time to sink in
6508263 im just really happy its hard work for my entire life that came through now
6508264 i trained really hard for this and im just really happy that i finally get a medal in my individual event
6508265 i think my training was going really well and i was able tonight to stay focused on what i had to do and not stay focused on my result or on how the other divers were doing i think that was the big key
6508266 i tried to be patient i just tried to kick them down the last 100
6508267 i knew if i was patient in the race and played it smarter than yesterday id be ok
6508268 event in denver at the democratic party convention to honor

6508270 de cualquier forma todos los pilotos estamos en las mismas condiciones desde luego nosotros hemos preparado a conciencia esta carrera pero las impresiones que tendremos en pista a partir de ma ana ser n fundamentales
6508271 voy a trabajar muy cerca de mis ingenieros en los pr ximos d as porque necesito tener muchos datos
6508272 este es un deporte fascinante precisamente porque puede suceder de todo estamos confiados en nuestras posibilidades pero sabemos que los rivales han aumentado su fortaleza lo mas importante en las pr ximas semanas es finalizar en los puntos de forma constante
6508273 es un sue o pero creo que se ha hecho justicia
6508274 es un sue o llegar a la final ol mpica
6508275 el partido se nos ha puesto un poco cuesta arriba con el 1 0 luego hemos ido luchando y un poco hemos creado nuestras ocasiones en la segunda hemos dicho venga va y te encuentras otra vez con otro gol es un poco dif cil reaccionar de esta manera pero aqu ves un equipo que lleva a os trabajando que no tira la toalla y creo que se ha hecho un poco justicia
6508276 esto a veces es peligroso no siempre te sale bien tenemos la suerte de que nos est saliendo bien pero tenemos la final del pr ximo d a y ah hay que empezar desde el minuto uno para tener nuestras opciones
6508277 jugar una final para m es un sue o supongo que para cualquier deportista ol mpico lo es y una vez que est s all intentar ganarla con alemania repetimos peros ahora nos encontramos en la final ya nos conocemos ellos nos conocen a nosotros y ser un partido muy bonito
6508278 me encuentro en un buen momento de forma y contento con mi punta de velocidad

6508280 no ser una meta f cil pero lo m s importante es que la escuela de boxeo cubana est m s viva y presente que nunca en los juegos de pek n donde ya nos daban como muertos antes de haber llegado para competir
6508281 hemos silenciado a muchos cr ticos a todos aquellos que hicieron pron sticos agoreros y ahora estamos preparados para completar una actuaci n que ya considero sin precedentes
6508282 nuestro deporte del boxeo sabe la responsabilidad que tiene con el pueblo cubano y lo que significa
6508283 mi sue o es igualar a mi padre y junto a l inscribir mi nombre como campe n ol mpico
6508284 como es l gico todo puede suceder cuando lleguen los combates de semifinales pero nuestro compromiso es seguir con los fundamentos del boxeo cubano y estoy convencido que los triunfos van a continuar

6508369 affaires vallen niet goed te praten maar ze hoeven niet het einde van een huwelijk te betekenen integendeel ze kunnen je huwelijk ook redden het slechtste dat je kan doen is je schuldig voelen en daardoor alles opbiechten
6508370 eerlijkheid is allemaal goed en wel maar alles vertellen maakt alles kapot vooral vertrouwen en mentale rust
6508371 de enige reden waarom mensen alles vertellen is dat hun schuldgevoel verlammend werkt en ze er willen van verlost worden maar je zou beter op zoek gaan naar de oorzaak en die aanpakken in plaats van alles te verpesten voor iedereen
6508372 eens het begonnen is kan een affaire het begin worden van een proces waarbij orde op zaken wordt gesteld als dat goed gebeurt zal iedereen daar beter van worden

6508374 ze raken net zo verveeld in hun seksuele relatie als mannen als je weet dat 10 procent van de kinderen biologisch een andere vader heeft dan weet je dat er iets niet klopt feit is wel dat de maatschappelijke gevolgen voor een overspelige vrouw veel zwaarder zijn dan die voor een man
6508375 ik denk niet dat het huwelijk het probleem is het is alleen het beste dat ze konden verzinnen
6508376 zowel mannen als vrouwen worden onderdrukt door allerlei verwachtingen en vandaag de dag zijn de verwachtingen belachelijk hoog vroeger diende het huwelijk niet voor levenslange passie persoonlijke voldoening een zielsverwant en voortdurend geluk vandaag willen we dat allemaal en tegelijk met n persoon een leven lang dat is niet realistisch
6508377 waarom vindt iedereen het aanvaardbaar om slopende echtscheidingen te starten kinderen traumatiseren hun thuis en huis weg te nemen om vrij te kunnen seksen met iemand waarmee de seks uiteindelijk net zo saai zal worden als binnen het huwelijk
6508378 mensen hebben de neiging iets te institutionaliseren om het onder controle te krijgen het instituut huwelijk is bedacht om het probleem van seks partners en het opvoeden van kinderen op te lossen bovendien wordt het mannelijke libido gezien als een potentieel ontwrichtende kracht van de maatschappij de taboes en regels bestaan om de sociale stabiliteit in stand te houden voor een meerderheid schijnt het te werken waarom zou je het dan veranderen

6508400 this proposed regulation is about the legal right of a health care professional to practice according to their conscience
6508401 doctors and other health care providers should not be forced to choose between good professional standing and violating their conscience freedom of expression and action should not be surrendered upon the issuance of a health care degree
6508402 many health care providers routinely face pressure to change their medical practice often in direct opposition to their personal convictions

6508441 for the first time there is a consistent narrative steve brought extreme message discipline to an organization that never had it before
6508442 there has been a transformational change in the way americans get their news

6508444 the heart of all campaigns is kids in their 20s many of whom are in the early stages of work experience and these are concepts not taught in college but you have to learn in the real world
6508445 he made me earn my stripes and ive followed him ever since
6508446 he is widely applauded for getting arnold out of a mess

6508484 we are finding that if girls are for example very able mathematicians or linguists they can cope with the extra responsibility of starting as levels on top of their gcses
6508485 the lack of rigour is becoming a problem for the more able students
6508486 the introduction of the a grade a few years ago did help for a while but even at that level pupils are finding they need to stretch themselves a little bit further thats why we try to let them do as levels a year early so that they can help fulfil their potential rather than being held back
6508487 just getting them to do more and more gcses is not the answer it is the rigour and academic discipline that they need as well as the sheer quantity there is no point doing 13 14 or 15 gcses because what you need is greater depth

6508728 it was the hardest race ive done in my life and i think it damaged me psychologically

6508740 so far ims has mainly been deployed to support fixed line voip services rather than multimedia services likely because ims multimedia services to date have shown varying degrees of success as service providers accelerate their transition to voip to more efficiently compete and as more of them experiment with new mobile and multimedia services ims will be the glue that bridges their heterogeneous networks together and assures standardization of those services

6508764 i think everybody feels that a three team league will not last for long

6508777 getting rid of some of those older age guys in the work force is not that bad it gives you the opportunity to move forward
6508778 at first i do most of it by myself at home then ill invite friends in to replace the parts ive recorded
6508779 i dont play the cello but ill create the part through midi musical instrument digital interface then i will invite a real cellist in to re create that part and ill sample that onto the recording
6508780 when i first started doing head like a kite i asked myself how do we do this live i had various attempts at different lineups everything from a couple of djs to a full band but i think with trent we have the most flexibility we both have samplers and synthesizers but i am also playing guitar and singing and using various mixers trent is also playing traditional and electronic drums
6508781 even though there is only the two of us we loop ourselves and play over that and are able to maintain a pretty rich and full sound also because it is just the two of us were really able to move around a lot within the songs if i start to loop something new or if trent does the other one of us knows just how to follow and flow
6508782 the concept behind the new one is that of field recordings when we have been on tour i have been recording sounds from all the different cities we have visited its like an aural road trip when we get home i put together a database of all these sounds and name everything so that when i am writing i can just go in and grab things
6508783 sometimes i have an idea about kinds of sounds i am looking for other times they just sound interesting and ill know i can use them later lots of times when were out there i am hearing something that i have no idea what song ill put it together with
6508784 i dont really listen to much classic rock anymore but i think then listening to late led zeppelin drummer john bonham i became fascinated with big drum beats
6508785 this guy was playing these barre chords on a red gibson sg guitar like angus young ac dc had i was just blown away i thought wow and went out and bought a cheap copy of the sg
6508786 ive listened to a lot of solo records sometimes those records really suffer from the fact that it is the same person playing all the instruments all the time thats why i try to change it up
6508787 my criteria have always been that i want to make fun playful party music that is really catchy and memorable whether people want to play it in a dance club or on college radio
6508788 this time its different because now were in the business of running stadiums and building stadiums and thats never been done before particularly when you have stadiums that run 1 6 billion the estimated cost of the new giants and jets facility

6508812 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6508813 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6508814 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6508815 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6508816 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6508817 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6508818 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6508819 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6508820 i used to play that game every day and thats why i became a hockey fan thats how i got to know hockey and i fell in love with it back then
6508821 i really wanted the hockey show job and when i got it i was like uh oh what am i going to do because not only was i scared of the players i was scared of the fans because theyre so intense
6508822 and thats what the hockey show is about its the other side of the nhl we pay a lot of respect to the sport because it deserves that but we also give hockey fans a front row seat to the entertainment side of hockey
6508823 hockey certainly already crosses over into the world of celebrities
6508824 weve got the mike comrie hilary duff relationship going on the rachael hunter jarret stoll relationship on the show i do for people magazine online we actually featured hilary duff and mike one time and i hope to do more of that because there really is more to hockey than just the score
6508825 hockey is the only sport that makes me yell at the tv without even realizing im doing it
6508826 ill yell for whoevers doing good or whoevers doing really bad i think i lost my voice during the stanley cup playoffs last year
6508827 ill do the hockey show and when i get home ill get online and log on to facebook or myspace and really get into serious hockey talk with fans
6508828 its amazing to me that theyre logging on and talking from all over the world from germany sweden or the czech republic you see the worldwide appeal of the sport and thats awesome
6508829 id love to stick around the game for a long time because ive fallen in love with it even more now that ive really got my hands dirty with it
6508830 so id like to see how the league develops because its really growing again and i hope that trend keeps going theres so much history in the nhl and i hope more people learn to appreciate that the way i have
6508831 investors are unwilling to accept any positive view of the company management is unwilling to sell out at a deeply distressed value the stage is set for a hostile bid to take over the whole company
6508832 a deep pocket buyer would not be under any pressure to sell any assets
6508833 it could sell neuberger for more than the value of the whole company and basically own lehman brothers for nothing will it happen i do not know should it happen absolutely opportunities like this are rarely evident in the markets

6508843 the story begins in the tokyo underground in the house of kurogami
6508844 georgia has no other choice people have understood that if it is georgia today attacked by russian forces then tomorrow it could be poland or the czech republic
6508845 georgia was a russian colony for more than 200 years but this is the 21st century the time for colonies is over georgia now has the strong support of the outside world
6508846 the lands of south ossetia and abkhazia are our georgian land the demands of our people for their return are legitimate
6508847 i appeal to russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister vladimir putin to immediately end the occupation of georgia and to take their forces off its territory
6508848 well its just like a member of your family being hurt
6508849 you worry about them you dont know what to day about them you dont have a response but you are concerned about them
6508850 it was important to me not to make it a quasi realistic experience to make it an effective coney island attraction
6508851 the whole purpose of the project was to investigate and try to figure it out and better understand what it meant what waterboarding meant just for me
6508852 is that it that was a waste of my money
6508853 i want the last 30 seconds of my life back
6508854 a pretty gruesome thing to put on display for people

6508859 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime

6508864 we figured that is what andy would want us to do
6508865 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6508866 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat
6508867 if its going to be a close election it could be a huge factor
6508868 youre going to see some turnout like youve never seen before in the state of florida
6508869 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
6508870 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
6508871 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope
6508872 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
6508873 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a shark attack
6508874 the results of the latest quarterly brand watch report show that consumers perceptions of domestic brands remain strongly favorable in many categories particularly in the truck segment even in the midst of the current tough automotive marketplace
6508875 new car shoppers also are taking note of brands that are adding models to their new vehicle lineup such as audi in the sports car convertible segment resulting in heightened positive brand perception
6508876 brand watch provides tremendous insights into the minds of in market new car shoppers the very people upon which the future sales and profits of the automakers rest
6508877 in these tough economic times especially in the auto industry consumers voicing their opinions via studies like brand watch help automakers better understand how their brand is perceived right now and allow them to make real time marketing decisions that will positively affect their bottom line
6508878 we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
6508879 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
6508880 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6508881 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6508882 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to george bush
6508883 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6508884 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6508885 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6508886 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6508887 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today

6508898 a lot of these people cases of missing have not ever been heard beyond their local community

6508907 we have found that most violations stem from a few common mistakes that can be for the most part easily avoided
6508908 we hope to educate the community of commercial distributors redistributors and resellers on how to avoid violations in the first place and to respond adequately and appropriately when a violation occurs
6508909 too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members who know how to build and assemble the final released product
6508910 such knowledge centralization not only creates engineering redundancy issues but it also endangers gpl compliance which requires you to provide build scripts
6508911 the companies we contact about gpl violations often respond with we didnt know there was gpld stuff in there
6508912 integration of third party proprietary software typically requires a formal arrangement and management legal oversight before the developers incorporate the software by contrast your developers often obtain and integrate foss without intervention the ease of acquisition however does not mean the oversight is any less necessary

6509335 pressure for improved palliative care appears to have evaporated in the netherlands
6509336 the netherlands has moved from assisted suicide to euthanasia from euthanasia for the terminally ill to euthanasia for the chronically ill from euthanasia for physical illness to euthanasia for psychological distress and from voluntary euthanasia to nonvoluntary and involuntary euthanasia
6509337 once the dutch accepted assisted suicide it was not possible legally or morally to deny more active medical assistance to die i e euthanasia to those who could not effect their own deaths nor could they deny assisted suicide or euthanasia to the chronically ill who have longer to suffer than the terminally ill or to those who have psychological pain not associated with physical disease to do so would be a form of discrimination involuntary euthanasia has been justified as necessitated by the need to make decisions for patients not medically competent to choose for themselves

6509344 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to george bush
6509345 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6509346 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6509347 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6509348 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base

6509390 i have to admit that i didnt feel good when he withdrew because i know what he represents to the chinese people hes a hero here in china and id like to extend my best wishes to him
6509391 you also suffer in some cases like osaka and valencia i went into the race in good form and didnt do as well as i should have done but when you come to an olympic games those sacrifices are there
6509392 it was definitely easier to win in athens than it was here
6509393 i was nervous because china did not win the medal for the last two consecutive games
6509394 for years ive dreamed of creating a place for people that need reliable office space a cool community with interaction and flexibility
6509395 carrboro is the ideal spot for folks that telecommute from everywhere to the triangle to dc to san francisco to new delhi we have an amazing group of people right here looking for a place to convene professionally they may not want to work at home alone for long stretches they may not want to work in a vast commercial office this affords social interaction as well as professional opportunities in the end ccc can actually be less expensive than other office space and you get great coffee
6509396 this is a small project that probably a very few of you know about we are porting myst to the iphone ok before some of you start groaning this is an outside funded project that is keeping a few developers employed but it is really more than that it is an interesting and fun project this is also a very small team with three of us which includes derek rand not randy and myself

6509402 the situation is not widely known among politicians in brussels
6509403 in some schools in the rural areas children dont want to go to the toilets because they are too dirty
6509404 this leads to diseases like hepatitis a and blue baby disease which is due to a high level of nitrates in drinking water
6509405 its taboo they are ashamed to talk about toilets and they dont really know how bad the situation is in their poorest areas
6509406 corruption is everywhere in bulgaria and blocks the money that should go to the poorest people in the rural areas

6509490 my family and i recently returned in june from an 18 day luxury
6509491 there is a tidal wave of new capital projects around the globe which has put immense pressure on delivery times and has caused construction costs to skyrocket in addition brownfield operations have to contend with limited resources for proper maintenance of their assets in both cases lack of care in managing asset information the virtual asset leads to poor performance of physical and human assets
6509492 the current costs of poor asset information management are staggering throughout the asset lifecycle the performance of large scale capital projects and operating facilities are all hindered for example collaboration across global design and build teams handover of information to owner operators for better operations and maintenance management of change and information quality safety and compliance and the general ability to deliver the right information to the right people at the right time are all compromised better aim is a prerequisite not a nice to have to deal with the need to manage assets in a safe effective and efficient manner across the entire asset lifecycle the time to act is now
6509493 ultimately the lack of complete accurate and timely asset information leads to delays budget overruns poor reliability low productivity and supply chain inefficiencies
6509494 in todays business environment this can be the difference between business success and failure businesses need to invest in specific technologies to improve their operations for instance companies implementing an effective aim solution such as nrx asset center are able to improve quality and efficiency and dramatically reduce the risk of scheduling delays and cost overruns sap and nrx are working closely with our customers to tackle these challenges this ensures that the facilities can perform the way that the business expects
6509495 if users have to access multiple systems to do their jobs too much energy is drained and roi is diminished as solution providers we have to provide users with a seamless experience
6509496 the ability to merge content and data in a common workflow is a powerful business process enabler open text and nrx are working together to enable critical processes such as management of change moc and deliver a compelling experience to a broad spectrum of shop floor users
6509497 asset integrity is mission critical and accurate asset information is essential to the assurance of asset integrity this information which includes asset equipment hierarchies functional locations tags maintenance task lists maintenance plans and bills of materials must be sustained for the life of all assets
6509498 owner operators face many challenges in managing asset information data handover from engineering partners and oem suppliers often falls short where oem amp epc data formats and levels of detail differ from owner operator requirements for plant operations maintenance aim solutions such as nrx asset center support the operations readiness team by enabling automation of manual processes including loading of asset master data into the maintenance management system sap pm in our case in addition the operations maintenance team must review and assure the quality of critical asset information periodically throughout the life of every asset to sustain asset integrity solutions such as nrx provide support to such reviews enabling rigorous management of sap pm master data changes
6509499 large capital projects are faced with many challenges including distributed execution and labor shortages bechtels information management goal is to provide a project services network to the distributed team members and joint venture partners around the globe using only an internet connection and a browser
6509500 owner operators are demanding project information as a continuous deliverable in the capital project cycle the dump truck paradigm of handing over information at the end of the project is no longer acceptable
6509501 we have to provide a high quality flow of information from the beginning our project services network is leveraging solutions such as nrx asset center to serve as the project data hub which allows us to define better requirements collaborate with our suppliers and provide real time handover of information to our customers
6509502 from prior experience we have learned that aim solutions are essential enablers of user adoption and business process compliance
6509503 to ensure achievement of these factors we co developed business processes with over 100 people globally and built cross functional teams that spanned all units we are supporting these new processes by leveraging user friendly nrx solutions and end user knowledge and feedback throughout the projects
6509504 without the proper processes tools and controls in place from day one of go live data quality can quickly become an issue for example whether in big bang or incremental projects companies should start data collection and clean up prior to go live so their asset and document management systems are populated with comprehensive and accurate data and documents aim solutions reduce the time and cost incurred searching for and managing asset information and benefits are magnified if aim solutions are applied across all plants and business units
6509505 industry leaders are increasingly recognizing aim as an extremely important enabler of capital project delivery and asset performance this annual forum reflects increasing recognition of aim as a strategic imperative a growing community of owner operators and their partners are implementing practical and innovative aim solutions across the asset lifecycle we have come a long way in realizing the potential of aim across an enterprise
6509506 however the full aim vision will only be realized through cooperation within this community nrx is working closely with all stakeholders including owner operators engineering companies suppliers and solution partners such as sap and open text to address the compelling need of our customers for an end to end solution for aim
6509507 he clearly stated that we had no specific information on the number of casualties
6509508 we have been told that there have been casualties but we are not able to verify what casualties means whether people have been killed or whether they have been injured
6509509 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of the tibetan capital
6509510 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6509511 ten thousand people have been arrested we dont know where they are imprisoned

6509522 would have wide implications not just for airlines but for airplane manufacturers boeing and airbus

6509544 i have never seen so many senior newspaper executives so depressed and frightened for their future
6509545 there was a time when no one published on holidays maybe we should go back to that concept were considering the idea now
6509546 whether its in finance or editorial or production we know we have to change
6509547 i havent seen anything i would call radical despite all the talk
6509548 they used to say tell me whos doing this and if its working to increase readership now what they say is tell me whos doing this and making money at it everyone wants promises that risks they take will bring in dollars and of course nobody can do that
6509549 tweaking will kill you aggressively and noticeably changing the look and feel can and most likely will grow you
6509550 i think youre on the brink of seeing things that are going to push the boundaries pretty dramatically
6509551 youre not seeing it just yet but the conversations have taken a turn decidedly in the direction of radical change
6509552 let me tell you by the standards of whats required today i was a piker
6509553 i knew the business had to change and what i wanted to do was develop a culture of change but i sure dont want to glorify what i did because i was as much a part of the problem as anyone was
6509554 we are looking at trying to tighten up stories and see how we can convene more information in less space
6509555 the key is not to have fewer stories the vision is to make them smaller
6509556 i know of newspapers that for 20 years have had blueprints for killing days of the week
6509557 staffing a newsroom seven days a week has been tough
6509558 reporters spend a lot of time on those feature stories
6509559 you eliminate that section and you just bought yourself three days of reporting time if you still have that reporter
6509560 the big thing behind the redesign is cutting back drastically
6509561 were not trying to fool anybody with phony catchphrases like new and improved or to better serve you beginning monday were eliminating some things from the paper its as simple as that
6509562 i think its some reflection of the fact that were now cutting bone
6509563 i think appetite for change would be more aptly described as an appetite for survival
6509564 he said we are like drowning people who are treading water as fast as we can
6509565 we are dramatically bloated in newsrooms relative to the business we are dramatically under funded in advertising sales research and marketing now the money is gone and it is harder to get the money back
6509566 were committed to this innovation fund because we think we need a bunch of lines in the water to catch the fish
6509567 we made the decision that we were going to fish where the fish were
6509568 and thats a readership that is older more affluent and better educated
6509569 it scares me for instance to see our newspaper subscribers constantly being told the industry is dying and what they are doing is silly and retrograde instead of thanking them and restating our value proposition this seems like real simple stuff
6509570 the people who complain about shorter stories are journalists and i wouldnt even say reporters id say writers
6509571 newspapers are full of writers when they should be full of reporters
6509572 so long as the newspaper continues to publish daily in its current newsprint form
6509573 never was intended to apply to weekly publications or to distribution of content over the internet
6509574 for years weve been telling papers that modular is just one component of a larger program but at least the fact theyre looking at it means theyre willing to change
6509575 i was at a paper that had a rate card for just real estate that was 12 pages
6509576 newspapers are forever tweakers and tinkerers but were not big changers
6509577 what were lacking right now is really philosophical thinking if this is a seminal crisis then we have to do some seminal thinking and it really does have to be radical
6509578 little gti youre so much fun i love to drive you
6509579 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6509580 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6509863 what were proposing to do is save money when times are good so we dont have to cut schools and other vital services when times are bad
6509864 having that savings account is important because education is the single best investment we can make in our economy
6509865 its the best way to bring and keep good jobs in colorado

6509867 the state is not in a fiscal crunch right now in fact the state is in an orgy of spending the states revenue is up by 1 2 billion dollars the average family of four is spending more than 14 000 on state government each year that is a crunch that is fiscal austerity that is preposterous
6509868 unless we have a plan to provide the services that coloradans want and depend upon we will not be able to be the kind of state that can provide quality k 12 and higher education deal with our transportation needs and promote new energy production economic development and have the infrastructure to attract good quality jobs to our state
6509869 we will return to being unable to keep up with the demands of a growing state and growing economy just like we were before ref c
6509870 all that means is you have tax and spend folks on both sides of the aisle willing to support it this is just a ploy to have unlimited spending to fatten up the state budget they can lower spending on education divert the money to prisons roads salaries their pet projects and then they can replace the money with peoples tax refunds from tabor because we will never get those tax refunds again

6509892 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species
6509893 and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques
6509894 in light of our new findings the pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies

6509907 herr knes kann behaupten was er will seitens der versicherung gibt es daf r keine deckung
6509908 streiten in der ffentlichkeit ist sinnlos und ich sehe nicht ein dass die bev lkerung das zahlt
6509909 wir haben gegen die klage gestimmt weil wir nicht einsehen dass mit steuergeldern prozessiert wird
6509910 die entscheidung das bundesanhaltezentrum in leoben zu errichten stellt das resultat eines bereits langen und intensiven diskussionsprozesses in expertenkreisen dar wobei die nach dienstbetrieblichen und wirtschaftlichen kriterien definierten anforderungen einer detaillierten pr fung unterzogen wurden der standort leoben wurde unter anderem aufgrund seiner geografischen lage in betracht gezogen
6509911 dieses anhaltekonzept wird im bundesanhaltezentrum in leoben umgesetzt und stellt somit eine wichtige vorreiterrolle zur wirkungsvollen europ ischen r ckf hrungspolitik beziehungsweise zur bek mpfung illegaler migration dar
6509912 damit ist klar dass fekter platters kurs weiter f hrt
6509913 der menschenrechtsbeirat war in die konzipierung des raum und funktionsprogramms und den vorentwurf des konzepts laufend eingebunden

6509922 relevant magazine founder and ceo cameron strang has decided not to give the benediction at the democratic national convention as previously planned
6509923 as a pro life voter i never intended my participation to imply unequivocal endorsement and the dnc knew that and were fine with that
6509924 however the reality is through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passions but disagreements politically
6509925 so i brought that concern up to the dnc and they understood i recommended bestselling author don miller as a much better representative of our audience than i am and they were glad to invite him to give the invocation in my place

6509931 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6509932 im willing to serve but i do have a flight to michigan next week and its to see family and select my wedding venue let me assure you that there will be another trial probably murder one for my mother if i am blocked from traveling in any way shape or form here shes on the phone threatening me right now check it out do you have more donuts

6509942 the creators probably assumed a campaign with this level of creativity would go viral right away clearly it didnt did they really expect people to start pulling crazy pranks with cheetos who in their right mind is actually going to go out and buy 20 bags of cheetos to pull pranks with

6509958 worried about coming up with something good in that time frame
6509959 theres no ai artificial intelligence involved with the exception of goalkeepers so its fairly nail biting stuff
6509960 in our play tests weve seen people new to the experience playing it like schoolboy soccer all huddling around the ball and weve seen people who play week in week out holding their positions and screaming at their teammates just like they would on a real game
6509961 its centralized technology but the designs for the features come from the game teams getting together and thrashing out the detail
6509962 this is one of the best online experiences you can have as everybody is depending on their teammates to succeed and everything you do has a much bigger impact than if you were playing as a single player
6509963 your teammates will notice if youre having a bad game
6509964 i guess for us this was always where we wanted to go its a team sport so team play makes complete sense
6509965 this is the next frontier and theres still the goalkeeper to sort out for next year
6509966 es la forma m s directa de acceder al centro pero es demasiado larga para cualquiera por eso hemos pedido a la municipalidad que construya un funicular que la reemplace

6509972 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the us as well
6509973 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6509974 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6509975 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6509976 i believe we have delivered the biggest modernisation of the atp tour since its inception have attracted unprecedented levels of investment into mens tennis and have begun to feed the growing appetite for mens tennis globally both in established and emerging markets
6509977 im incredibly proud of what the board and my dedicated team have achieved for mens tennis and i am honoured to have played a part in taking our great sport to the next level
6509978 now that this much needed change has been realised i believe this is the right time for someone new to build on this strong platform

6509982 two or three years ago i think the assumption was many if not most people would be upgrading to new generations of laptops and desktop systems much more quickly than they have been
6509983 but the last generation of chips was very very powerful i think powerful enough for the vast majority of the applications most people use
6509984 the history of these sorts of things in terms of how theyll pay off has always been speculative and its been cyclical
6509985 one of the characteristics about seinfeld that gives him credibility in this matter is that hes always been somewhat of a cynic
6509986 hes always been the doubter always questioning the ethics of american society and business we do recognize that hes being paid for this but at least hes got that credibility
6509987 jerry seinfeld is not going to rescue a product that has true problems if its not a competitive product if it continues to dissatisfy the public jerry seinfelds not going to do any good for it
6509988 but if the product starts to get favorable word of mouth theres a synergy i would assume microsoft is looking for synergy here they obviously feel its a good product otherwise they wouldnt be investing this kind of effort in it
