1060083 thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name
1060084 lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless the lord
1060085 let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice

1060096 and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied
1060097 saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee
1060098 speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord
1060099 let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord
1060100 and they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy works lord god almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints
1060101 hear o ye kings give ear o ye princes i even i will sing unto the lord i will sing praise to the lord god of israel
1060102 therefore i will give thanks unto thee o lord among the heathen and i will sing praises unto thy name
1060103 it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick and praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the lord

1060112 saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee

1060116 who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen
1060117 by faith jacob when he was a dying blessed both the sons of joseph and worshipped leaning upon the top of his staff
1060118 and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david michal sauls daughter looked through a window and saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart
1060119 let them praise his name in the dance let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp
1060120 praise him with the timbrel and dance praise him with stringed instruments and organs

1060215 the election and obamas candidacy have focused these anxieties like a lens i found whites frustrated and indecisive about the campaign families at odds generations divided many who thought themselves beyond prejudice were surprised by their suspicions of the young black man from up north meanwhile many slave descended blacks hugely supportive of the half kenyan half kansan hawaii reared obama seemed afraid to hope too much inoculating themselves with pessimism about the chances that any man of color could win the presidency even this man even today or that if he does he will survive as i say emotions are raw

1060222 such a tilt of freedom in the direction of evil has come about gradually but it was evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent to human nature the world belongs to mankind and all the defects of life are caused by wrong social systems which must be corrected
1060223 enormous freedom exists for the press but not for the readership because newspapers mostly give enough stress and emphasis to those opinions which do not too openly contradict their own and the general trend

1060344 there are a lot more complicated issues than just copyright or trademark there are more complex issues than those in respect to the end user licensing agreement and antitrust issues come into play too
1060345 you agree not to install use or run the apple software on any non apple labeled computer or to enable others to do so
1060346 but take a look at the web site of the lead attorney representing apple
1060347 they came to us i think because this is a much bigger issue than just copyright
1060348 theres the fact that we are in the jurisdiction of the u s district court for northern california but weve also tangled with apple before weve dealt with apple so were familiar with the courts and the parties
1060349 what psystar might say is what we would like to do is use the mac operating systems unique features more broadly on a variety of hardware
1060350 i think its a very very hard argument to make but i wouldnt be surprised if they tried
1060351 my guess is that they will mount some kind of direct attack on apples exclusive licensing
1060352 during the development cycle we became aware of a potential performance issue on high traffic recursive servers defined as those seeing a query volume of greater than 10 000 queries per second given the limited time frame and associated risks we chose to finish the patches asap and accelerate our work on the next point releases that would address the high volume server performance concerns
1060353 apple uses the popular internet systems consortium bind dns server which was one of the first tools patched but apple has yet to include the fixed version in mac os x server despite being notified of vulnerability details early in the process and being informed of the coordinated patch release date
1060354 apple may be stuck between a rock and a hard place on this one but theyve chosen the worst possible option remaining silent
1060355 if it were unstable my recommendation would be to make a preliminary patch available that those using it as a recursive dns server can apply with an active exploit no patch at all is not a viable option and places customers at high risk let the customers make their own risk decision
1060356 reconfigure those servers to forward dns requests to alternative platforms such as bind on linux or unix or microsoft servers until apple issues a patch

1060371 we always used to watch the olympics as a family growing up
1060372 my dream was winning a gold medal for the united states
1060373 now even though the dream changed a little bit its been kind of bigger than i expected in a way because this story has caught the world by storm im wondering why this girl from south dakota got caught up in this worldwide story
1060374 i need to learn the language im working on it ive only been over there for a year or two and its a difficult language i know a few words but i need to get a lot more words most of the girls speak english so its fine
1060375 if people really do have a hard time with it they should take it up with the olympic committee or fiba im playing well within the rules and i think its a little strange it happens all the time in the olympics for people to get maybe upset or bent out of shape about me is strange because this is something the united states has done many times
1060376 there have been many foreign athletes that have come and competed for the u s and won medals
1060377 i think everyone wants to see the russia america matchup
1060378 if i have to play the united states obviously im going to go out there and compete to win but thats not what i want i know its what everyone else wants but its not what i want
1060379 once the ball went up it was just another basketball game
1060380 you want to meet the u s as late as possible
1060381 i have been playing against those players for 10 years i think when the ball goes up its just going to be another basketball game you just go out there and compete and enjoy the moment since its not going to happen again
1060382 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and im really looking forward to it
1060383 im glad im not doing as many interviews now just being able to be here and play basketball i think its been put off in the back of my mind for so long just concentrating on what weve been doing in the wnba and now is the first time ive been able to be over here and enjoy the experience
1060384 id love to go watch even if were not taking part in it i hear its pretty tremendous
1060385 im still learning most of the girls on the team three or four of them ive already played with and i have a history with them they are really a good group of girls they are really sweet they have made me feel very welcome and tried to get me accustomed to them very quickly and build chemistry on and off the court
1060386 maria stepanova came up to me and said i was initially against having an american on our team but now that i know you you can play with us any day
1060387 to me that was like a small bridge that had been built thats what the olympics is about its a small microcosm of what the goal should be on a grander scale

1060393 the company with all diligence has attempted to avoid a bankruptcy filing however the filing became necessary because of the recent failed effort to obtain financing and the recognition that the companys entire 1 8 billion of debt may soon be in default
1060394 while wci remains cash flow positive and our asset base is strong our ongoing operations have been adversely impacted by the continuing downturn in the real estate sector and the overall economy
1060395 like other large homebuilders across the country wci continues to experience declines both in pricing and the sale of new homes and condominiums as well as dramatic increases in cancellation rates
1060396 as a result we need to restructure our debt and bring our capital structure in line with todays marketplace realities we believe chapter 11 provides the most efficient and timely process for accomplishing this
1060397 day to day operations will continue as usual while we work with our stakeholders to restructure the balance sheet
1060398 we will continue to sell build and deliver homes without interruption construction and sales activities will continue employees will come to work and be paid

1060426 israel decided to take the humanitarian decision to transfer to jericho 87 residents of the shujaiya neighbourhood in gaza because of the violence carried out by hamas
1060427 we talked with them on the bus and we told them that jericho and the west bank are different from the gaza strip and that the israeli army controls this region they have to respect the law
1060428 received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
1060429 we never wanted anyone to leave in this regrettable way
1060430 this is a path that does harm to them because by the mere act of fleeing a person places himself in the realm of suspicion
1060431 we condemn the criminal acts undertaken by the hamas leadership against the palestinian people in shujaiya in gaza
1060432 these criminal acts have forced a number of people to flee to israel including women and children and so president abbas has called on a number of parties to rescue those who are in danger from the hamas militia
1060433 the president has also called for the protection of those who are still in gaza and for the women and children to be left alone in their homes
1060434 whatever is going to happen is going to be the right ending
1060435 im going to be spazzing until i finish the book and find out
1060436 ive been keeping this secret for years its fabulous to finally be able to talk about it im very much looking forward to the discussion at the event this tuesday in chicago
1060437 the chinese government and people will honor their commitment and do their utmost to host a high level olympic games with distinguishing features
1060438 it is also our hope that through the games we can show the world the sincere aspiration of the chinese people to share the benefits of development and to join with the rest of the world in building a bright future
1060439 the largest international sports and cultural event in the world
1060440 outstanding contributions to the progress of world sport the strengthening of friendship among athletes and people of the world and the promotion of world peace and development
1060441 the mere fact that the olympic games are coming to china home to nearly 20 percent of the worlds population is significant
1060442 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
1060443 its a fall winter book maybe for fall winter 2022
1060444 you didnt like the clothes i bought so i returned them and bought a samovar instead every child needs a samovar
1060445 im sorry it was a surprise i planned on sending all of you on a wonderful tour of the southern hemisphere but i refuse to even reserve a ticket if you plan to dress the child in fall winter clothes during the antipodean spring summer season
1060446 we do have to remember inflation is at a 16 year high so the rba is not going to be rushed into cutting interest rates
1060447 we think they are more likely to stay on hold at least one more month
1060448 wasted the efforts of the copyright holders who produced anime with massive production costs so the property damage is also enormous
1060449 i am trying to find an answer to that question i did notice the haze
1060450 hes going to be treated like every other employee and hes going to come in and go through the procedures that all new employees go through when they get hired
1060451 hiring for the audit division is really different from many of the other hires in the secretary of states office were in the early stages right now of a review of these procedures and the processes for hiring
1060452 there is no doubt that with gasoline prices dipping below 3 90 a gallon we have a bit of a reprieve on the energy front
1060453 but the reality is that this is a chicken and egg game because the decline is reflecting the consumer recession
1060454 by the end of the third quarter theres a good chance oil could be below 100 a barrel and a good chance it could be above 150
1060455 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
1060456 shiloh calls them her babies she and z pick out their clothes and help change and hold them its sweet they are little mommies
1060457 this is mads fourth fifth time becoming an older bro hes asking us when we can have more
1060458 if they had been conceived through ivf we would have been happy to discuss it
1060459 but we have been fortunate never to have had fertility problems
1060460 viv is proving to resemble ange in spirit attitude and physicality and knox a bit of me

1060462 we are hard pressed to imagine a better candidate than dr jha
1060463 we believe he is very well respected both in industry and in the investor community
1060464 from motorolas perspective we expect this will improve the companys competitive positioning
1060465 given their checkered past and the difficulty that they had in getting to this point the bungling of the hatfill part of the investigation leads me to be very skeptical

1060467 afghanistan is a nato mission and he knows nato backwards and forwards maybe showing that he has a grassroots constituency is one way to do it
1060468 lets stir up some race tinged shit knock the obama campaign off its stride and test whether it can recover
1060469 first you help inject race into the campaign and raise its focus as an issue as the mccain campaign did yesterday with a little door opening from obama himself
1060470 hes a blackity black angry black man just like jesse jackson and al sharpton and louis farrakhan
1060471 i didnt play the race card and you know it because of x y z
1060472 played the race card from the bottom of the deck
1060473 the black guys playing the race card and they got it even though obamas comment was pretty innocuous and self evident
1060474 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know
1060475 i dont look like the other guys on a dollar bill
1060476 there those black people go again playing the race card
1060477 hey people may not vote for me because of my age
1060478 there those black people go again playing the race card
1060479 there those black people go again playing the race card
1060480 i do not look like the guys on the dollar bill
1060481 i am waiting for one of the obamaphiles to explain what it was he meant then by saying
1060482 why are we talking about this why doesnt mccain have anything to say other than this garbage why does mccain want us to be discussing this
1060483 there is absolutely no other possible explanation for his repeated remarks about how different he looks and how people are trying to make others afraid of him
1060484 cable channels have two african americans debate who is or isnt raising race in any case black faces dominate the cable airwaves and some of those faces are angry
1060485 i wanted to tell an epic love story whether its romeo amp juliet or colossus amp northstar everybody loves an amazing love story and i think what i really wanted to be able to tell was that colossus especially with northstar was a relationship that people found relatable and ended tragically there are some surprises to come but getting to that point doing everything that hes done only to lose him in that moment while he was desperate to save him for me it doesnt matter if its scott and jean or colossus and northstar its a love story and i think the audience is adult enough and sophisticated enough and savvy enough it doesnt matter if theyre heterosexual or homosexual its just a love story between two people who really care for each other
1060486 we congratulate senate president therese murray house speaker sal dimasi sen dianne wilkerson other members of the legislature massequality and glad for this latest step forward toward full equality
1060487 we also thank gov deval patrick for his leadership in supporting the repeal of this antiquated and discriminatory law this is an important step toward making clear that marriage equality for committed gay and lesbian couples means full equality under the law
1060488 this is a true victory for equality in repealing this law weve sent the message loud and clear that in massachusetts we respect and honor all families weve ridded our state laws of the last vestige of discrimination against same sex couples and we once again lead the way for equality for all people
1060489 omg im gaining im not supposed to be gaining im going to screw this up
1060490 i want everybody to respect him he has a legitimate question
1060491 i think you are misinformed about when you say not one time every issue youve spoken about i actually did speak out about im going to go through the various specific examples ive been talking about predatory lending for the last two years in the united states senate and worked to pass legislation to prevent it when i wan in the state legislature and i have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target african american and latino communities ive said that repeatedly number two jena six i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong that theres an injustice thats been done and we need to change it thats number two applause when sean bell got shot i put out a statement immediately saying this is a problem
1060492 im just trying to answer your question on each of the issues that you mention i have spoken ive spoken out forcefully i was a civil rights lawyer i passed the first racial profiling legislation in illinois i passed some of the toughest death penalty reform issue in illinois that doesnt mean im always going to say what you guys want me to say which gives you the option of voting for somebody else or run for office yourself
1060493 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
1060494 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
1060495 while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1060496 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1060497 this addiction is one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced from the gas prices that are wiping out your paychecks and straining businesses to the jobs that are disappearing from this state from the instability and terror bred in the middle east to the rising oceans and record drought and spreading famine that could engulf our planet
1060498 senator obama has looked at this issue and he realizes americans are suffering and he made the distinction that we do need to tap the strategic energy reserve
1060499 i will not pretend the goals i laid out today arent ambitious they are i will not pretend we can achieve them without cost or without sacrifice or without the contribution of almost every american citizen
1060500 but i will say that these goals are possible and i will say that achieving them is absolutely necessary if we want to keep america safe and prosperous in the 21st century
1060501 to provide good jobs a clean environment and a safer world
1060502 as it is today going by just one case i do not think the law can be amended
1060503 we sympathise with her case and would discuss all other avenues
1060504 categorical opinion that if the child is born it would suffer from serious handicaps
1060505 i like the fact that every two years you get a new car and you dont have to pay anything to return it
1060506 i cant drive a car for six or seven years i just cant do that
1060507 i can guarantee theres going to be a great deal of legal action against them
1060508 were not going to allow it to come to a terminal
1060509 no one in his or her right frame of mind would have said these things given this the best option would be for the teacher to be assigned to a desk job and not be allowed to be near youngsters anymore
1060510 the allegations were serious as no one was allowed to insult others especially in a school environment
1060511 develop and conduct educational programs designed to prevent discrimination before it occurs and to promote better relations among the countys diverse racial ethnic religious cultural and social groups

1060516 we are keenly following the case and are awaiting the judgement on the compensation claim for a total of 1 6 million bahraini dinars 4 2 million we had filed for the 16 indian workers who had died in the fire
1060517 until and unless the representative of the company is held guilty the issue of compensation cannot be taken up
1060518 we also believe that this case will be an example to others so that workers are accommodated in safe conditions
1060519 we demand bd100 000 for each victim as they were forced to live in an unsafe and overcrowded place they were not provided with a proper kitchen so they were left with no option but to cook their food inside their room
1060520 we respect the government of bahrain and are certain of the impartiality of its judicial system

1060635 if i were in canada i would be hopping mad about the lack of ability to crack down on these corrupt people who are involved in this trade and on the farmers who are growing the opium
1060636 they are clearly financing the people who are attacking your troops attacking the british troops in helmand province and attacking the americans throughout as well
1060637 his power base is in helmand and kandahar provinces thats where 70 to 80 per cent of the opium is grown and he does not want to crack down on the people there because he needs their support for re election
1060638 look we cannot support your government anymore if youre protecting narco traffickers
1060639 you karzai need to hit the trade at all levels
1060640 we all agree with the fundamental need to deal with the problem
1060641 i know that canada is prepared to set up and be part of the solution does it necessarily mean going out and burning crops or whatever the latest technique is im not sure about that
1060642 it may well be better to focus on interdiction to break down the downstream supply chain that creates the value as opposed to alienating the farmers whose support you ultimately need as you build democracy in afghanistan

1060648 can you name any prominent republican that has said that obama is not patriotic
1060649 can you name any prominent republican that has brought up that has said that sen barack obama is not patriotic or that hes got a funny name or that he doesnt look like those presidents on dollar bills do you know any prominent republican that has said any of these things
1060650 can you name any prominent republican that has brought up that has said that sen barack obama is not patriotic or that hes got a funny name or that he doesnt look like those presidents on dollar bills do you know any prominent republican that has said any of these things
1060651 republican and conservative websites for more than a year and a half now have been doing that
1060652 i will tell you that if obama is elected president then the radical islamists the al qaida the radical islamists and their supporters will be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on september 11 because they will declare victory in this war on terror
1060653 it matters because they read a meaning into that in the rest of the world that has a special meaning to them they will be dancing in the streets because of his middle name they will be dancing in the streets because of who his father was and because of his posture that says pull out of the middle east and pull out of this conflict
1060654 w hy do we wear pins because our country was under attack and to politicize once again the war to this extent well who cares about the war are you proud of your country do you believe in america
1060655 f irst of all at least the president wasnt making a statement and he did have his hand over his heart in the right place alan
1060656 no obama but the difference here is barack obama made a statement about the iraq war with the flag pin and to not do it here people are raising questions about why is this another statement
1060657 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1060658 can you name any prominent republican that has said that obama is not patriotic
1060659 my sons nails have started peeling from the base of the nail towards the tip usually fingernails peel from the tips or so i thought anyway what could be causing this to happen hes the pickiest eater ive ever met could it be malnutrition
1060660 was he sick recently when the kids are sick their nails stop growing when they are over the sickness the nails grow again and it is not unusual for the nails and toes check the toe nail beds to slough and look like theyre peeling when they grow again my son goes to daycare and they all just got over hand foot mouth disease his nails and two big toes were peeling ped said lets just watch it but then i heard all the kids in his room has peeling nailbeds so i called my daughters ped dermatologist and thats what he told me hope that helps i thought he smashed his fingers too but the toe nails ruled that out
1060661 here we go again with the mta asking riders to pay more this year and the next with no end in sight
1060662 how dare the mta consider a fare hike when they havent delivered on the promises from the last increase
1060663 the mishandling of the transit budget has made one thing abundantly clear the current organization is not qualified and the only solution is a shake up of the mta at the highest level
1060664 did you have anything to do with the disappearance of your daughter
1060665 it is not the brain that matters most but that which guides it the character the heart generous qualities progressive ideas
1060666 i had expected to be amongst the top 5 and since the scores are not out yet i am hoping to get a score of 440
1060667 i have always been interested in it and feel not only is a good field but will also give me great scope for research
1060668 focus give every subject equal importance keep a basic but flexible schedule where you say that i will finish so much in so much time
1060669 shitikanth might not continue at indian institute at technology for long because he is determined to go for research in physics at massachusetts institute of technology
1060670 though initially we were surprised but we knew he was different to other children and would do things differently
1060671 it is not the brain that matters most but that which guides it the character the heart generous qualities progressive ideas
1060672 theyre a physical team theyre a big team they did a good job on the offensive boards which kept us out of the open court for a little bit
1060673 but in the second half i thought we did a much better job being the initiators and playing with a bit more energy whether we scored the ball or whether we got a defensive rebound we played with more energy and pushed the ball up the floor
1060674 this was a really good win for us because russia put the ball in the hands of their two best players holden and kirilenko and when they do that theyre a really good team and a tough team to defend
1060675 i thought our defense was excellent and on offense we seemed a little bit out of synch
1060676 what im really pleased with is it didnt come easy offensively for us and it never had a negative impact on our defense and thats a really big thing
1060677 theyve been recruiting me since my freshman year and theyve been there at every one of my aau games
1060678 and the new facilities will be there my freshman year i like bradleys offense better than some other schools i was looking at which play a lot slower
1060679 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
1060680 do you enjoy working no not thinking not ideating working executing you have to execute a mediocre idea well executed is worth 100 times as much as a great idea that isnt seen through do you really think that ray kroc was the first guy to have the idea of a hamburger chain
1060681 do you gamble i really think that there is something deep inside of some people that makes them crave risk thrive on it personally i can honestly say id rather lose 200 on a round of golf than not gamble at all and i love golf im not sure you can fake this one
1060682 can you fake it a lot of entrepreneurship is promotion you cant wear your emotions on your sleeve or youre dead why because 90 95 of the time your company is in trouble and you have major doubts but guess what investors customers partners everyone they do not want to hear it see it or sense it they want confidence yes later you have to deliver quality but today you have to deliver confidence
1060683 are you good on your feet things change all the time poof the business plan you spent 8 days perfecting is gone a lot of people cant stand it when plans change at the last minute others expect it and stay up late
1060684 there is a completely expressed concern that they dont want to pursue a hypothesis because that hypothesis could be damaging to the public health community at large by scaring people
1060685 autisms false prophets bad science risky medicine and the search for a cure
1060686 i heard linda telling samantha that she thinks you look nice
1060687 hey john i really like your lie you always have the coolest ties in this office not even our boss could beat you at that one
1060688 what would you like to be when you grow up
1060689 as inflation takes its toll the need for investing becomes even greater as digging into reserves looks inevitable for an increasing number with nearly 5 3 million people now being forced to spend more than they earn the harsh reality of today means the end of the spend now pay later culture we would urge customers to review their finances and carefully look at their spending and savings habits with some careful budgeting it is possible to keep on saving even a small amount if you are having financial problems it is important that you take action and speak to a debt adviser

1060695 his batman rasps his lines in a voice thats deeper and hammier than ever
1060696 delivers his lines in a hoarse voice with an unvarying inflection
1060697 sounded absurdly deep like a 10 year old putting on an adult voice to make prank phone calls this time bale affects an eerie rasp somewhat akin to brenda vaccaro doing a miles davis impression
1060698 this allows cowards to hide and this is why voters are losing faith in our electoral system
1060699 i apologize to all who are the victims of this hoax
1060700 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1060701 they are trying to put the patient into a position to lose his or her life or to collaborate and we cannot agree to it
1060702 are not experts on medical issues therefore they are required to take only security precautions into account
1060703 interrogators then question the patient and demand information in return for permission to access care
1060704 in some cases patients are asked to collaborate on a regular basis
1060705 i remember that the questions were about my connection with hamas i said that i had no connection with them
1060706 he asked me about my friends and i collected my papers in order to leave
1060707 it really is true that one bad apple can make the entire bunch go bad
1060708 people want to perceive themselves as eating healthier than they do
1060709 you need to be realistic on how many people youre feeding
1060710 if its soft and rubbery it might not be good broccoli and asparagus for example you can tell by the smell when it goes bad
1060711 the fact that were lower seems to speak volumes about how falling demand has moved into the top place in this market
1060712 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
1060713 how changes to beliefs about climate change occur when consumers read information supplied by the news media
1060714 man too may be somewhat responsible for the cooling trend the university of wisconsins reid a bryson and other climatologists suggest that dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and fuel burning may be blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the earth

1060721 bob hagan the teams public relations director showed me that article last night at 11 o clock i was in a personnel meeting with rick spielman and george paton until 11 o clock with the coaches so i have a pretty good idea how that went down you know you can shape the environment however you want one way or the other we havent had any contact with them
1060722 my comment would be i think thats the same journalist that wrote that there was a cell phone involved that the packers gave favre
1060723 no but nor do i expect one he has a lot of different things on his plate whether its the hall of fame or dealing with other issues hell
1060724 everyone has been very eager to help saying what a great guy heath ledger was everyone except mary kate who has refused to speak

1060734 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
1060735 this decision is a great victory for innovation technological progress and consumers rights
1060736 we agree with the appeals court ruling that found we do not believe that an rs dvr customer is sufficiently distinguishable from a vcr user to impose liability as a direct infringer on a different party for copies that are made automatically upon that customers command
1060737 the appeals court properly found that copies of material buffered for a mere 1 2 seconds do not constitute a copy over which a customer or cable company could be sued
1060738 the content industry in suing cablevision once again overreached in its goal to limit the personal uses of increasingly popular technology we hope this case will be another signal to hollywood to scale back its attacks on consumer friendly technologies
1060739 in contrast the u s copyright office has proposed that buffered copies of material should be subject to copyright license we hope the copyright office will heed this decision and will reverse its position
1060740 from time immemorial indians traders explorers young adults and college students have used the apple river as the highway of travel unloading their canoes and later innertubes full of alcohol at the bend just below here they stumbled up the trail across what is now the beach and along the hill to where men could launch buffalo chips and later water balloons and women would expose themselves at other river travellers this tablet erected by the phi beta gamma fraternity in 2008
1060741 why not go the whole distance if you are installing a scoreboard and you find out it will be the second biggest in the country why not go for the whole kit and kaboodle and figure out a way to install the largest
1060742 this is the new gophers stadium they are going to play football here

1060747 sure some of the features nice but i definitely prefer the old stadium
1060748 im going to put posters up around the building announcing a pool party on the 6 i talked her out of it mostly because her boss didnt have a sense of humor and if it got back to him shed be a dead girl walking
1060749 oh i get my own cabinet in the kitchen great
1060750 i get my choice of beds upstairs ill probably go for the bigger one
1060751 i dont even want to know what it would be like to share a bathroom with a woman that size with colon cancer
1060752 i understand aaron a delicate situation for him but if you let the competition decide who wins no one can be upset about that and brett may not win and if that happens youre in the best of all situations because aaron has proved to you that he can go out there and get it done
1060753 i wouldnt have any idea this early in the preseason whether thatd be an accurate ranking
1060754 i know its something thats not very significant until the end of the year and thats what we talked about with the team
1060755 once we hold up that acc trophy everythings going to be fine
1060756 my first fall practice my first camp it was a little different than the spring
1060757 i think i have to get better and make more adjustments
1060758 lets go lets go the ball cant be on the ground
1060759 if our guys see it and are hungry and keep the hunger and it creates a sense of urgency then thats good
1060760 if they dont work as hard and say weve arrived weve got this ranking and go about business as usual thats not good
1060761 frost amp sullivan expects small scale deployments to occur during the second half of 2009 by a few tier one mobile operators and based on the results of the 2009 launch other mobile operators will decide if they need to choose a similar path in the years to come
1060762 proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user generated content
1060763 we encourage sites which handle user generated content to develop as a priority
1060764 not all witnesses favoured an approach which designates more types of content as illegal and which places an onus upon isps and others to prevent access once they become aware of such content
1060765 you could have an access control policy for people working remotely or locally
1060766 blog hunting i will go blog hunting i will go hi hoe the dairy oh blog hunting i will go
1060767 justifiably proud of his administrations leadership in ramping up its commitments to the global efforts to control aids over the past five years and in proposing to do more in the next five
1060768 only hitch is whether the money will actually materialize in the form of appropriations
1060769 implies appropriations of roughly 9 billion to 10 billion a year
1060770 but advocacy groups say the amounts emerging from congressional appropriations committees for fiscal year 2009 will be little more than half of that
1060771 come up with a startling insight into the aids epidemic in this country by contrasting it with the global epidemic
1060772 shown the same zeal to control this domestic tragedy that it has shown in the global campaign
1060773 surely we should be doing as much to prevent the spread of the aids virus in our own communities as we are trying to do abroad
1060774 saving literally millions of lives and it will stand as bushs greatest bipartisan foreign policy achievement
1060775 less than six months remaining in the bush presidency the rest of his legacy remains at best cloudy
1060776 but the impressive results of his battle against the scourge of aids cannot be denied its impact in real lives saved will be felt for many years to come
1060777 sets a goal of treating more than the two million patient target set in 2003 but how much more isnt clear
1060778 with this funding we will support treatment for at least three million people
1060779 picking a genuinely pro life running mate would be a revolutionary decision
1060780 but kaines performance on life issues is like watching a contortionist on a tight rope
1060781 moral views on the value of unborn life are so private he would overturn the will of the legislature to ensure they do not prevail
1060782 in the democratic party there is no reason to take such a risky position except conscience
1060783 if obama wants to choose an advocate of catholic social justice as his vice president perhaps he should consider a consistent one
1060784 improve the health status of people of the african diaspora by building the capacity of faith communities to address life threatening diseases especially hiv aids
1060785 fail to see aids treatment for what it is a stop gap measure to tide humanity over until we can collectively reach what ought to be our real goal stopping hivs spread entirely
1060786 individual basis living with aids is a proper goal on a population basis it is catastrophic
1060787 viewed as an interim step its funding and expansion make sense not only morally but also as a practical matter of economics and foreign policy
1060788 b ut only if a massive commitment to finding searches for both a vaccine and cure for hiv are sustained for years to come
1060789 ought to be eliminated entirely from the pantheon of threats to humanity
1060790 the legislations purpose is recognized in that it helps resolve the sex ratio imbalance and protects the fetuses right to life
1060791 overly limits the basic rights of parents and physicians to put a blanket ban through the latter half of pregnancy
1060792 considering this we cannot but question whether the sex ratio imbalance is a serious social problem and whether the fetus gender notification is serving as a cause for abortion
1060793 concerned that the courts decision could bring sex select ive abortions back into fashion
1060794 many married couples choose to have only one baby regardless of the babys sex or none at all
1060795 both men and women with sleep apnea in the general population not patients mostly undiagnosed and untreated had poorer survival compared with persons without sleep apnea given equal bmi body mass index age and sex
1060796 our findings of a significant high mortality risk with untreated sdb sleep disordered breathing independent of age sex and bmi underscore the need for heightened clinical recognition and treatment of sdb indicated by frequent episodes of apnea and hypopnea irrespective of symptoms of sleepiness
1060797 i was surprised by how much the risks increased when we excluded people who reported treatment with cpap
1060798 our findings suggest but cannot prove that people diagnosed with sleep apnea should be treated and if cpap is the prescribed treatment regular use may prevent premature death
1060799 sleep disordered breathing and mortality eighteen year follow up of the wisconsin sleep cohort
1060800 once we have a low expectation of the political system and what it should deliver the corporations work is done
1060801 people with poor health habits die younger and so spend less time on medicare
1060802 charge fair and stable premiums that will not depend on health status
1060803 we wonder how eager private insurers would be to sign up sick people at fixed premiums especially since the obama plan lacks a mandate requiring everyone obtain coverage
1060804 if one truly wants to lower administrative costs why not expand medicare to all
1060805 simple government run plan that provides the basics and lets people buy private coverage for the extras
1060806 illogical and grossly unfair tradition of employer based coverage and brin g healthy people into the risk pool
1060807 the only candidate on a major party presidential ticket to have proposed and implemented a universal plan could well be a republican
1060808 now high on the list of john mccains possible running mates
1060809 merely tinkers around an expensive inefficient wreck l etting romney take over this issue could appeal to moderates who regard republicans as the guardians of a crazy status quo
1060810 the right wing has been beating up romney over the reforms which he designed in cooperation with a democratic legislature
1060811 achievement threatens the conservative myth that government cant organize a health care system that the public will like
1060812 as a vice presidential candidate romney could help deliver michigan to mccain but even better he could help deliver a national health care policy
1060813 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
1060814 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
1060815 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
1060816 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
1060817 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
1060818 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
1060819 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
1060820 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
1060821 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1060822 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1060823 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1060824 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1060825 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1060826 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1060827 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1060828 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1060829 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1060830 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1060831 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1060832 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1060833 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
1060834 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
1060835 maybe god planted it there for us i believe he can do that
1060836 if you keep driving this fast youre going to blow a tire on the tent trailer
1060837 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1060838 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1060839 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1060840 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1060841 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
1060842 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
1060843 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1060844 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
1060845 it cant be her she has short hair women with short hair are never the romantic leads
1060846 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1060847 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1060848 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1060849 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1060850 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1060851 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1060852 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1060853 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1060854 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1060855 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1060856 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1060857 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1060858 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1060859 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1060860 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1060861 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1060862 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1060863 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1060864 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

1060869 hello dr frank im mary tillman i dont want to waste your time im calling to ask you a question do you think its possible that this administration orchestrated my sons death
1060870 im positively stunned by his response i thought he would gently tell me that he doesnt believe the administration is very honorable but it would never do something so heinous as to have a soldier killed
1060871 i think its possible mrs tillman im a psychiatrist it would be unethical and irresponsible of me to tell a grieving mother to pursue such a thing if i didnt think it was possible
1060872 indicating that pat was a very special young man the language rumsfeld used was that pat was world class and that they should keep an eye on him
1060873 im not sure what that meant but writing something like that writing a letter to pat obviously hes going to be concerned when hes killed hes going to want to know what happened
1060874 by how the government has betrayed not only pat but also the american public
1060875 its consuming and emotionally draining but very revealing it takes weeks there are days i become very angry that my family and i have to do this just to get the truth that should have been forthcoming from the moment pat died
1060876 the panel has failed it received a flurry of white house e mails but no documents about friendly fire it interviewed several top white house officials not a single one could recall when he learned about the fratricide or what he did in response
1060877 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
1060878 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
1060879 you are having contractions and are in early labor we are going to try giving you some injections to stop the contractions as well as start an iv
1060880 baby is breach legs are closed might be a girl cant say sorry
1060881 are u sure u only want the first 2 tires balanced because driving too long on the bad tires will mess them up real bad
1060882 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1060883 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1060884 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1060885 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1060886 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1060887 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1060888 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1060889 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1060890 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1060891 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1060892 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1060893 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1060894 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1060895 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
1060896 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
1060897 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
1060898 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
1060899 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
1060900 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1060901 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1060902 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1060903 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1060904 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1060905 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1060906 christian doctrine decrees that embracing jesus christ as personal savior is the only road to redemption jesus said i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me obama disagrees he the holy son says there are many paths to the same place is that christianity apparently so in post christian america
1060907 the tsa is well aware that the removal of shoes is not our most popular policy
1060908 since this is a test to collect data passengers will still need to remove their shoes prior to walking through the magnetometer
1060909 if customers see anyone removing parts or the entire fire hydrant and they arent using official city vehicles we are asking them to call the police department
1060910 the same day i ordered your report i purchased a supply of prilosec otc and mylanta
1060911 you are our own why did you not come till now
1060912 no maharaj i do like but parents would be worried
1060913 i want to go to mother i am remembering her very much
1060914 see mother see mother once you see have darshan of mother your mind will no longer go after the half naked forms of hers roaming about the streets
1060915 i have seen all i now understand who is who
1060916 that boy with specs who comes with you take his company he is a devotee
1060917 how long will you live on with regard to swami ijyananda
1060918 there are some lions among men waiting to pounce upon society
1060919 boys and girls take a copy of the book some book was being distributed among the audience for free
1060920 the whole of the north east is as if sitting on top of a volcano it is only mother kamakhyas grace which is preserving it intact
1060921 whenever you come to calcutta you must visit me ask these people referring to respected sanjay maharaj who was standing near the door for my address
1060922 jagadish the lord or beloved of the universe god himself had escorted you home last night
1060923 see you are a human being so am i so is ijyananda ji yet why are people so attracted towards him and not towards us there is a reason i will tell you about an incident once a professor of gauhati university who had lost his only son came heart broken to ijyananda ji after only a few visits the professor was smiling and even able to console other members of his family he had gained a philosophy of life
1060924 ma a naked person has come he wants me to undergo advaita sadhana
1060925 see even at this age ijyananda ji was about 85 years old then dhrubajyoti maharaj or ijyananda ji washes his own clothes he just will not allow anyone else to do his job
1060926 your foundation is good but you must build up your health
1060927 following is a simple calculation which determines at which rate you should keep your heart working while exercising
1060928 we all agree that militarized foreign policy is not in our interest
1060929 in many cases the department of defense has had to act by default
1060930 not all of africa is in conflict but the whole model
1060931 the united states has an interest in both fundamental and instrumental development assistance
1060932 none other than humanitys savior messiah returning lord and true parent
1060933 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
1060934 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
1060935 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
1060936 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals
1060937 weve done flights to lithuania poland honduras guatemala and mexico
1060938 but out of about a dozen cases a year we probably fly only a couple back
1060939 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
1060940 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
1060941 he didnt talk he didnt understand anything he stayed curled up in a ball but he was alive
1060942 i said sure what can come of such a case
1060943 then it took on a life of its own they probably regret they ever called me
1060944 the question to be answered is if the patients condition is terminal
1060945 we arrived for a visit and he said to me you are montejo
1060946 the real problem is if we find an underlying problem and now we have six of them six patients who showed up in dialysis
1060947 a community hospital is going to give care but is it the right thing we have a lot of american citizens who need our help we only make about 3 percent over our bottom line if were lucky we need to make capital improvements and do things for our community
1060948 or the government should step in and otherwise exercise its authority for deportation or whatever it wants to do
1060949 and if the rehab worked then luis might have become a functional person and nobodys charge
1060950 once you take that step for how long are you going to do that a year 10 years 50 years
1060951 informed us of how expensive it was becoming to care for luis given that there was no insurance and that he is illegal and that the state wont assume responsibility for his charges
1060952 if a hospital in florida asks if we can take care of a guatemalan patient the tendency is to say yes
1060953 this case is not simply a case as some would try and paint it of money this is a case about care for a man in this country illegally who has reached maximum medical improvement at our hospital and is ready to be discharged and whose home government
1060954 your honor this is a case about a hospital that has failed to do its job properly
1060955 why are you sad when you have basically everything that could be offered to you
1060956 as aquinas once stated the good is not the enemy of the perfect
1060957 we went to see him at the hospital and his bed was empty
1060958 that facility could have taken care of me any day
1060959 telling everyone that he was from miami florida and showing them his toy cat
1060960 that he would be staying with his new friends in guatemala and that i was leaving
1060961 its the same as the classic fall on the stairs right
1060962 you go to my home you fall on my stairs and then you sue me i am responsible
1060963 he was lying in the hallway on a stretcher covered in his own excrement
1060964 so we cleaned him up and we brought him home
1060965 its a letter that says listen dont take action to dump this individual because youll be risking legal action
1060966 should they win we would like them to take those damages and pay his hospital bill
1060967 they chose the wrong way to deal with it the right way would have been through the legislature there is no program in place to appropriately distribute care to undocumented persons who are catastrophically injured and there should be but you dont stick a brain injured immigrant on a private plane and spirit him out of the country in the predawn hours
1060968 the first striking thing was his disposition he was very very happy
1060969 then the second thing he was well cared for what i did was i got down over him and hugged him but also smelled and there were no bedsores nothing was malodorous
1060970 i said his quality of life is better than it would be in an american nursing home
1060971 but i hazarded a guess that his longevity of existence was probably severely curtailed
1060972 there was no real compelling reason to think of bringing him back to florida
1060973 we needed to focus on getting help to him or him to help in guatemala
1060974 for many years i am caring for him like he is a baby changing his diaper washing him but this is worse i am worried to leave him alone at all
1060975 the day my mother is no longer whats going to happen to me
1060976 i headed north like a peasant with a heavy bundle on his back bent over determined to better himself
1060977 other people had things so i thought why not me but now i regret it maybe god was punishing me for my illusions
1060978 thats the usual story of patients that are released from the national orthopedic hospital
1060979 in cases like that if you cut the medical care youre hurting that person
1060980 youre doing just the opposite of what the medical system should do that goes against every international convention of human rights and health to send him to guatemala was to send him to very poor living and health conditions and probably he will die because of that and thats not fair
1060981 it would be possible to set up a good health care arrangement for him because in private practice we have all types of specialties that he needs
1060982 i am sending you some little things luis i hope that you like them
1060983 that we miss you and love you a lot may god continue to bless you
1060984 which so far as bears on this case forbids knowingly attempting to persuade induce entice or coerce a person under 18 to engage either in prostitution or in any sexual activity for which one could be charged with a criminal offense
1060985 a person who demonstrates by his conduct that he has the intention and capability of committing a crime is punishable even if his plan was thwarted
1060986 you have to do something that makes it reasonably clear that had you not been interrupted or made a mistake for example the person you thought you were shooting was actually a clothiers manikin you would have completed the crime
1060987 it is always possible that had the intended victim been a real girl the defendant would have gotten cold feet at the last minute and not completed the crime even though he was in position to do so but there is a sufficient likelihood that he would have completed it to allow a jury to deem the visit to meet the pretend girl a substantial step toward completion and so the visit is conduct enough to make him guilty of an attempt and not merely an intent
1060988 that the district judge should not have prevented the psychologist whom the defendant had hired as an expert witness to testify with respect to the attempt
1060989 the psychologist could not have been permitted to testify that the defendant did not intend to have sex with
1060990 a mem ria se forma somente se s o as cobaias quem ministram a droga em si pr prias ou seja somente quando existe a vontade de drogar se
1060991 the key to successful leadership today is influence not authority
1060992 if your actions inspire others to dream more learn more do more and become more you are a leader john quincy
1060993 the quality of leadership more than any other single factor determines the success or failure of an organization
1060994 although we havent seen any evidence yet in fact business is on the up we feel that there is probably going to be a downturn soon and so we are going to consolidate and see what happens
1060995 it depends on many individuals contributing to a common project with a variety of motivations and sharing their respective contributions without any single person or entity asserting rights to exclude either from the contributed components or from the resulting whole
1060996 these are not naughty postcards from the beach they are undoubtedly porn pure and simple some of it is quite dark its quite unpleasant

1061063 both the villages of castorville and polluxton have experienced sharp declines in the numbers of residents who pay property taxes to save money and improve service the two villages recently merged their once separate garbage collection departments into a single department located in castorville and the new department has reported few complaints about its service last year the library in polluxton had 20 percent fewer users than during the previous year it follows that we should now further economize and improve service as we did with garbage collection by closing the library in polluxton and using the library in castorville to serve both villages

1061175 some insurers can make a decision in the same day or right on the spot
1061176 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information

1061179 though most people tell the truth most of the time there are people out there who dont who leave out something thats incredibly relevant who may even be able to defraud a company

1061181 i had a patient on amitriptyline for migraines and they were denied life insurance because its also an antidepressant
1061182 i had to explain it wasnt being used for depression
1061183 i wrote an appeal letter and they still wouldnt give it to her
1061184 weve got to stop these practices before the marketplace is fully developed and patients lose all control over their medical information
1061185 a lot of insurance companies are starting to use this type of data

1061191 the police seem to be trying to stop kingsnorth climate camp going ahead and if this is the intention it is illegal and i will be drawing it to the attention of the european commission as well as the uk authorities
1061192 we wanted to police lawful protest recognising that this is the right of people in a free country
1061193 however equipment we seized from the site suggests that some protesters were clearly intent on unlawful action
1061194 a new coal fired power station at kingsnorth will most likely prevent the uk from meeting its own c02 targets perhaps the police ought to be more worried about this corporate environmental destruction instead of people in a field
1061195 the figures are a scathing indictment of how profoundly us prevention efforts have failed

1061202 i dont know i guess my advice to you is to get off the internet and meet people in person online is just not the way to go
1061203 the results are what we expected to find given the changes in climate over the last 20 years

1061213 das ganze hickhack in den letzten tagen hat schon sehr genervt klar ist es schade aber man muss auch als fan jetzt nach vorne schauen mit dem geld sollte man einen top st rmer holen trotz allem w nsche ich rafael van der vaart alles gute bei real madrid
1061214 es ist wirklich schade dass er geht er war und ist ein sehr guter spieler aber es ist richtig gewesen ihn zu verkaufen er w re nur noch ein jahr geblieben unsere van der vaart trikots werden wir auf jeden fall weiterhin tragen
1061215 16 millionen euro abl se sind viel zu wenig im verein war die rede von 20 oder 30 da er aber n chste saison f r 1 5 gegangen w re ist der verkauf verst ndlich man darf jetzt nicht schlecht von ihm denken sondern stolz auf seine vielen taten zur ckschauen
1061216 ich finde es schade dass er geht das trikot zieh ich aber weiter an
1061217 real madrid ist ein gro er verein da kann man schon verstehen wenn er da hingeht es gibt aber noch andere gute spieler und das hsv team ist auch ohne ihn stark genug
1061218 das waren alles feine aktivit ten aber die haben uns nur geld gekostet
1061219 die kauffrist ist anfang august verstrichen in dieser woche bekommen wir die abrissgenehmigung
1061220 gut dass die sache nun zu ende ist und dass jetzt ruhe einkehrt so kurz vor saisonbeginn muss sich die mannschaft auf das wesentliche konzentrieren k nnen grunds tzlich finde ich es aber unm glich dass die transferperiode so lange andauert das muss ge ndert werden der hsv sollte jetzt keinen schnellschuss abfeuern nat rlich braucht der klub einen vollstrecker aber das sollte keiner sein der nur den kader auff llt
1061221 rafael ist ein sehr wichtiger spieler vermutlich der beste hsv spieler in den letzten 25 jahren seine tore seine assists und seine pers nlichkeit werden uns fehlen er hat hier bis zum letzten tag gas gegeben
1061222 ich habe in ihm einen freund f rs leben gefunden bin stolz auf ihn und finde es klasse dass er jetzt beim gr ten fu ballverein der welt spielt er hat sich in der kabine von jedem spieler einzeln verabschiedet wir hatten eine sch ne zeit mit ihm
1061223 unsere schmerzgrenze ist erreicht oder sogar berschritten worden real hat unseren w nschen entsprochen und rafaels hundertprozentige identifikation mit dem hsv war nach dem angebot von madrid angegriffen er war eine schillernde pers nlichkeit aber der hsv besteht nicht nur aus rafael

1061277 the first wave of americans to default on their home mortgages appears to be cresting but a second far larger one is quickly building

1061279 normally companies can deduct the cost of deferred comp only when they actually pay it
1061280 but intels contribution to the pension plan was deductible immediately its tax saving 65 million in the first year in other words taxpayers helped finance intels executive compensation

1061324 i do believe that the convergence of our party on sort of a single approach to immigration is part of what has done that in other words today theres a different debate going on than there was a year ago and i think that part of that is because senator mccain went out and exercised a position on this issue vigorously that didnt work and he was not able to pass a piece of legislation that addressed the issue in away that he thought would benefit the country the most part of the message he got was how little confidence the american people have in the institution of congress and the administration to implement that law i dont think theres much other reason you can debate the merits of it from a public policy point of view but clearly the american public opposed it because i dont think they thought anything was going to get done now the issue is we need to exert every resource we can as a government whether congress or the administration to get control of our border before we can effectuate a real change in our immigration plans
1061325 it doesnt even come up in conversations you hear a lot of things immigrations not one of the hot topics anymore so wihtin our own party i think that issue has matured into something thats less divisive
1061326 do you think the gop is going to allow their rank and file members to attack their nominee day in day out over the immigration issue if they do the results could be disastrous as mccain will be going around the country trying to unite a very fractured party that is already pretty suspicious of his conservative bona fides can you imagine one republican after another having to come to the microphone to denounce the mccain kennedy bill and thats what reid and pelosi need to call it every chance they get and then mccain being dogged by reporters asking about it multiple times each day

1061332 the rest of america can start looking forward to these types of recreational areas as well
1061333 thanks for your support sen mccain please keep selling us out so we can look forward to more deaths more rockings more shootings more assaults and more mayhem if mccain can contribute to this much mayhem in his home state by encouraging millions more illegal aliens to come here with incessant pandering and promises of future massive amnesty programs just think of the damage he can do as your president
1061334 the omnibus spending bill dismantles the only legislative advancement made in recent years towards securing our border with mexico and represents a prescription for failure that directly threatens the safety security and prosperity of the american people
1061335 ninety percent of our supporters are behind either romney thompson paul or hunter for president because they appear truly opposed to amnesty for illegal aliens
1061336 eighty four percent of our supporters say they would support lou dobbs for president if the gop primary fails to yield a candidate opposed to amnesty

1061350 were finally on our way to making a difference with illegal immigration in butler county
1061351 just in this county alone the cost to the taxpayers for illegal immigration is 1 million
1061352 add to that the cost to the citizens throughout the united states and that taxpayer burden is in the hundreds of millions of dollars
1061353 we will not endorse sen john mccain even though he is currently representing our home state of arizona
1061354 has never been serious about immigration enforcement and he has never been serious about supporting the border patrol
1061355 if sen mccain succeeds in becoming the president of this great nation we believe it would be a disaster for border security and the enforcement of our immigration laws we believe the american people have already seen enough of this type of behavior from our politicians
1061356 for those who care about the issues of illegal immigration and border security we ask that you not support senator mccain under any circumstances
1061357 dont be fooled by any tough talk he may use now regarding illegal immigration and border enforcement his actions over the years his complete lack of support for rank and file border patrol agents and his incessant calls for more amnesty programs for the illegal aliens who succeed in violating our laws have done all the talking we care to hear
1061358 senator mccain has sought to sell us out and sell our mission out at every turn of all people he should understand what its like to serve your country and to have politicians and others turn their backs on you please honor senator mccains military service but support someone else for president

1061370 that status quo could change tonight or down the road
1061371 a democracy is always temporary in nature it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury from that moment on the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy which is always followed by a dictatorship

1061510 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
1061511 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
1061512 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
1061513 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
1061514 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
1061515 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
1061516 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
1061517 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
1061518 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
1061519 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
1061520 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
1061521 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
1061522 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
1061523 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
1061524 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
1061525 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
1061526 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
1061527 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
1061528 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
1061529 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
1061530 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
1061531 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
1061532 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
1061533 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
1061534 as of today we have no defense against such an attack we need space based missile defenses to protect against an emp attack
1061535 nuclear missiles dont discriminate on party lines when they land
1061536 senator obama has been quoted as saying i dont agree with a missile defense system and that we can cut 10 billion of the research out never mind as i say that the entire budget is 9 6 billion or 9 3 billion
1061537 needs a missile defense that is so strong in all the different phases we need to defend against that countries will decide its not worth coming up against us

1061617 we have two but a lot of times we dont have enough people to run them
1061618 in some communities out there its the volunteer fire department or nothing
1061619 theres not the economic base to support a career department so if they cant keep the volunteer fire department viable then the potential exists that theyre not going to have any protection at all
1061620 your mom and your dad was in the fire service and their parents were in the fire service and it just goes on from generation to generation
1061621 it makes you wonder where well be 20 years from now
1061622 every time i hear the pager go off you know you wonder whos gonna be there and whos not
1061623 sometimes you just dont have anybody to go especially during the day
1061624 i hate to admit it but theres been more times this year where other departments have had to help us out
1061625 were trying to put together a case and information to send in protest and get as many people that are interested in it to protest
1061626 its fundamentally a different situation today than it was then
1061627 the tribe spent millions of dollars on road and traffic safety improvements in and around dehesa road and sycuan road
1061628 when this occurred planes were flying everywhere and controllers had no means to get a hold of them
1061629 this is the critical health care institution for the coronado community
1061630 the san diego coronado bridge is the main link to san diego transportation to the nearest hospital in an ambulance might take 15 to 20 minutes double that if there is traffic versus an emergency room a few minutes away
1061631 thirteen new states regulated mma last year and hawaii is one of them so we want to come there but the regs arent done yet were not like all these other cheese ball shows we cant go there until the regs are done
1061632 he said a glucosamine supplement he took was later found to be contaminated with a testosterone booster but he said if thats how the steroid got into his body he cant understand how he should be held responsible for it
1061633 even if it was a tainted supplement i had no intentions of taking it and it was somebody elses error
1061634 i think they should be at fault rather than me contamination of supplements is an issue there have been people who have tested positive in the past for that reason but i dont think the fighter should be held responsible its not the fighters fault
1061635 white has known sherk for seven years and said he believed sherk without hesitation when sherk denied taking the steroid white admitted it was blind faith since he never saw a shred of scientific evidence that would exonerate sherk
1061636 im 38 years old and ive seen a lot of guys use steroids in my time
1061637 when guys are doing steroids you can see the difference before they start they have a certain body type it looks a certain way then they take the stuff and there are changes and the body looks a different way then when they get off it changes again and looks a different way again
1061638 with sean sherk his body looked the same since the day i met him theres never been one change this guy is a maniac when it comes to how he treats his body and what he puts in it i totally totally totally believed what he told me
1061639 as for the whole tainted supplements thing i find it a bit odd how the state athletic commissions puts the entire onus on the athlete for knowing what they put in their body its very common for fighters to use supplements any fighter that uses supplements could have been at risk for taking nandrolone or whatever accidentally what are fighters supposed to do stop taking supplements just to be on the safe side
1061640 its hard to say how this case is going to turn out but id expect that randy couture would defintely be bound to zuffa until october 2008 and that the one year no compete clause after that would also probably hold up in court because no compete clauses of one year or less usually do hold up in court
1061641 what could couture possibly accomplish in mma when hes 46 years old
1061642 its interesting to note as mmapayouts adam swift has that zuffas lawsuit against couture only mentions his employment contract with zuffa ie commentating duties not his promotional contract ie fighting
1061643 mynetworktv president greg meidel said the decision to not bring the novelas back on tuesday nights was made because its monday international fight league telecasts was not a compatible audience for driving viewers to the more female skewing novelas the next night
1061644 a source familiar with the medical results of hong man choi and antonio silva said each was found to have pituitary gland tumors
1061645 had someone whose sole job it was on saturday june 2nd to handle tracking the number of fans entering the coliseum
1061646 currently our rules do not support overturning a decision based off the drug test results however armando garcia and i are meeting with the ag attorney general next month to begin the process of modifying the existing laws to incorporate those rules for the future should everything move along like i anticipate i would expect to see the changes in place by the end of the year
1061647 we have a problem if the promoter is licensed with california and they knowingly placed a denied athlete in a fight then the promoter is looking at having their promoters license suspended they are looking at a fine or they could possibly have their promoters license revoked
1061648 it is unusual but a great way to promote our finale to a potentially new audience the special is also available on spiketv com and ifilm
1061649 like freedom baseball is that stake where energy and order merge and all complexity is purified into a simple coherence

1061651 welcome to the wonderful world of not knowing what the hells going on
1061652 la base de datos en l nea m s simple que pueda funcionar
1061653 previous research has shown that stroke patients who were depressed did not regain function as well as other patients and they had a higher risk of dying all patients who have suffered a stroke are now screened for depression but this is not the case for patients at any stage of cancer
1061654 we know that a patients mental state affects their physical state but not enough is known about why this happens we believe that when someone is depressed they lose motivation and therefore the will to live
1061655 depression affects 25 of patients with advanced cancer but at this stage it is difficult to diagnose whilst patients with advanced cancer are clearly very ill they can still be effectively treated for depression but the first step in the treatment is the recognition that the patient is depressed
1061656 ive already gone on record saying that im willing to terminate the management agreement upon the successful closing of the proposed sale of all the vhs system which was voted unanimously by the board
1061657 for the good of our vhs system i sincerely believe it will be productive to postpone any debate regarding our respective positions at this time while the district is attempting to transition its facilities
1061658 too important to allow dr chaudhuri any potential involvement with the running of this company
1061659 when youre above 8000m youre physically dying you can survive a maximum of 24 to 48 hours with supplementary oxygen itd be less than 24 hours without
1061660 wilco was up there three days and three nights above 8000m without supplementary oxygen after a few days everyone thought hed died
1061661 then people from base camp saw this lone figure in an orange suit coming down the mountain its massive you cant explain it
1061662 something has dropped into the log basket and the log basket burnt through
1061663 the big thing is if you are going away you shouldnt leave clothing drying near a fire or a heater
1061664 i did find them on that website at us675 and decided no im glad i did
1061665 i had some suspicions about it especially having heard that these tickets were only available through accredited agencies and tickets werent actually leaving beijing you had to pick them up there the usa site just didnt ring true to me and i dont have a spare us675 anyway
1061666 that site www beijingticketing com is the biggest scam in the world
1061667 they are based out of arizona somewhere and are being sued by the united states olympic committee if they can even find them they are a complete fraud and anybody who gave them money off their website to unofficial people really are taking a hell of a risk
1061668 where people lose money we obviously have huge regrets about it where we have heard that people have gone elsewhere and got caught we have made every effort to get them tickets and have done so
1061669 we have managed to get a lot of the parents that have had problems sorted out but we wouldnt know how many there are because they wouldnt all come to us they might feel so ashamed they dont want to do anything so we dont know how widespread the effect is
1061670 a person is guilty of disorderly conduct when with intent to cause public inconvenience annoyance or alarm or recklessly creating a risk thereof he obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic
1061671 weve tried our very best to cover everything and protect the community
1061672 i believe it is valley health systems only chance to keep the hospitals open
1061673 im doing this willingly this way i hope the hospital will survive if i didnt do it the hospital could end up like other hospitals in southern california that have closed down
1061674 they are both pretty now be quiet and take your seat behind that erica
1061675 we are excited to see the first successful operation of our new technology
1061676 we have evaluated the initial results and are now ordering some design revisions that we believe will improve the efficiency of our technology then we will resume further testing
1061677 the initial sizing and grinding of biomass affects efficiencies and quality of all the downstream operations new technologies and equipment are required to process biomass between the field and conversion facilities
1061678 biomass is the single renewable resource that has the potential to supplant our use of liquid transportation fuels now and help create a more stable energy future using our indigenous biomass resources we can potentially fuel our cars and provide new economic opportunities across the nation

1061702 getting beyond shiny object syndrome requires the lead communicator to stop then go back to the master communications plan a healthy evaluation of social media tools should reveal whether or not stakeholders are even using these shiny objects from there you can begin to evaluate whether social media really belongs in your plan
1061703 one way to win in software is to make your application fertile for building upon open your api give people tools to build an ecosystem around it and it becomes a lot harder to pull away and go elsewhere other tools have enough of the same features on the surface but once you go past being a certain level of user its not a 1 1 comparison twitter has a software community jaiku just has big parents
1061704 sure there was some help in spreading the news sola oyebade chief executive of mahogany model management has been running a facebook text and email campaign in an attempt to make the issue the biggest selling
1061705 one big drawback of the search site is that you have no idea how important the links it serves to you are here would be my wishlist for the site 1 have a sort function by relevance and date 2 include the ability to subscribe to an rss feed of your results for those of us that use search for business purposes to keep track of brand identity this is essential
1061706 lets imagine the past two days had cuil opened itself up to a public beta testing process in the lead up to the launch not only would they have a stronger product but they would have a vocal community of users willing to jump to their defense
1061707 as i said in the video overall im not sure it sucks yet but i agree with mel webster that it wasnt ready for prime time and this much publicity in fact all the publicity just created a higher bar for cuil to reach which was impossible at this stage of their development with a simple demo you can see that cuil is in early beta perhaps even alpha so why wouldnt you launch it with that caveat to create better expectations
1061708 reading through a the reviews compared the results from cuil to google and found the new search engine wanting the service has a tough competitor to beat in google especially on its own turf i am not convinced that any company can come into the marketplace and outright beat google for search the company has so many advantages years of technology development for results the server farms and the partnerships
1061709 my blog has a nifty plugin installed called alex king the blog has no separate url when you visit here at
1061710 there is a personal experience but it moves away from being centered on the one machine

1061713 any service you currently offer companies like microsoft google yahoo and others will offer
1061714 youve just got to get over the idea that you your ma and your 10 gauge are keeping your data more secure than google is
1061715 once we went live the privacy concerns just immediately went away
1061716 you dont get too many no brainer decisions in your career
1061717 for each of these new stars though there must be a dozen more who using technorati ranking and twitter followers as a measure of their worth have become social media egomaniacs they believe their stats they are read they are followed ergo they are important worthy superior a vip they link comment tweet and post they must feed the monster but do they listen contemplate analyze there is no need they are stars the numbers say so
1061718 why cant everyone focus more on being themselves and creating content they enjoy creating rather then focusing on the
1061719 the key as always is use the tool effectively and understand the terrain upon which you have chosen to engage your enemy its go big or go home its time to break out of your institutional language your ingrained reticence to confront opposition and your dependence upon senior administrators to speak on behalf of the organization thats probably why the tsa blog recently called out all its lurkers the large majority of the 4000 unique readers per week that the tsa blog receives to submit questions to be answered in coming weeks
1061720 make no mistake about it advertising on facebook may for the time being deliver better roi youll probably see better click through rates on display advertising there you can use facebook ads to really target and hone in on parties of interest and there is probably a better brand recall on advertising that is happening on their pages for now
1061721 so im wondering is there a time when you need to burn the ships because the truth is social media
1061722 from a pr and marketing perspective the blogcatalog might also be a good place to start looking for blogs on a particular subject that you might have a hard time finding elsewhere but i would be sure to run any blog through technorati and also check linkbacks from google link www blogurlhere com to see how influential the blog is among its peers while links and influence numbers continue to be a hot button issue among bloggers from a pr marketing perspective they give some idea of who are the influential voices at a given time
1061723 i dont often talk about this on my blog but the biggest benefit of blogging for me is that the blog is a learning tool theres this constant dynamic to create content mainly for myself but also for an audience and in the process of content creation i often have to learn something new i conduct research or interview people also if you want to learn about social media theres nothing better than getting involved with the technology
1061724 you toss your cups bottles and other trash onto the ground creating a layer of litter that eventually will be tripped over and stomped into the turf
1061725 os t xis dependem de permiss o p blica e s o considerados bens de uso comum dada finalidade de transportar pessoas n o podendo veicular propaganda de natureza eleitoral

1061729 virality if there is such a term lies in results it means that if youve created something worthy of passing along and comment it will be more likely to reach epic heights on youtube or whatever other way youre choosing to measure it
1061730 theres a much larger picture to this pr thing and i remain troubled that so many of our partners on the marketing side dont see it so today i begin the process of setting the record straight well see from the volume and quality of the conversation if any of this matters while pr frequently integrates its efforts with partners in marketing pr is not and never will be a subset of marketing
1061731 i just got back from the pre blogher party at guy kawasakis house even today as i gave a social computing workshop i heard from yet another brand that they are desperately trying to reach women bloggers
1061732 i have multiple blogs dip my toe into twitter social networking etc but i also recognise that the best form of communication is face to face that the traditional media remains a vibrant and welcome part of our media landscape and that while changes are taking place nothing is dying bar the fax probably and look how long thats taken
1061733 the next time you decide to solicit a blogger with the pitch of a client imagine we are both meeting at a cocktail party
1061734 this isnt the first time news organizations have fallen for altered photographs in 2006 reuters apologized after publishing images of war torn lebanon that proved to have been edited and in 2007 the la times published trackbacks 0
1061735 its okay to acknowledge that pain if you ask me even online
1061736 if you look at video today essentially its a passive experience
1061737 a cat in this unconventional setting will incite interest cinder and heidi purring in the window of the citys oldest business makes you warmer than another log on the fire it gets people talking it stops people as they walk past its bromwells story its the story that differentiates them from the suburban super store that sells truckloads of fireplaces and accessories along with bar furniture and pool tables
1061738 start leaving comments on blogs uploading images to flickr building a community on twitter or friendfeed or whatever else that strategy entails that helps further the discussion and illustrates your companys commitment to developing these online relationships
1061739 one of the most shrewd observations about the pank professional aunt no kids demographic is that these are professional women with disposable income marketing to parents assumes discretionary income exists but most parents are weighed down by significant costs already such as mortgage saving for college and household expenses related to raising kids
1061740 while you monitor coverage of your company begin adding listening to the conversation to it truly paying attention to the sentiments issues opinions and kind of talk that goes on out there about your company or your industry get comfortable with hearing what is being said if people are not talking about you it may mean a number of things they may not know about you they may associate you with a brand or a story that does not meet their needs in perception etc
1061741 other bits raised who is responsible for social media conversations perhaps that depends on the organizations goals
1061742 i asked several social media consultants bloggers marketers search engine optimizers and social media addicts about what they considered to be essential skills and characteristics of the most efficient and results driven social media consultants in the many paragraphs that follow learn from many of the experts and hear what they consider success when using social media to engage with consumers about products and services

1061753 this weekend in san francisco the second annual iphonedevcamp 2 took place whereas the first confab focused primarily on web applications this one has a definite native application flavor thanks in large part to the fact that the iphone software development kit sdk is out of beta and now available for developers
1061754 at iphonedevcamp this year there s a greater and more palpable sense of excitement in the air than last year and it s reminding me of the time when i was writing applications for another apple handheld product the newton
1061755 while the green device from apple was not a commercial success
1061756 fourteen years ago the newton could fax send email and receive pages the iphone is a communications powerhouse with 3g edge wi fi bluetooth

1061758 internet banking plus uses technology that requires internet explorer version 5 0 and above on a pc unfortunately the service will not currently work using other internet browsers or apple mac computers
1061759 unfortunately it is not possible to access the internet banking plus service using an apple mac computer the service requires the use of certain activex controls which sic allow your computer to make the internet banking plus service a secure and highly interactive experience
1061760 in addition the activex controls are used to create a digital safe and run the functionality in the internet banking plus service on the computer at present the apple mac operating system does not support the use of these activex controls
1061761 attracting the type of customer who was an eager user of online banking in the early days
1061762 try and keep sic your operating system up to date we would recommend that on windows you have 2000 or later and obviously for the apple mac users and linux users keep an eye on their operating systems and make sure that you keep those up to date

1061770 but it is in compassionate relationship that suffering discovers redemption
1061771 christian theologians often speak of the redemptive value of suffering
1061772 to accept some suffering is to bear it in a way that may avoid unintended and future harms
1061773 the secular problem of evil and the vocation of medicine
1061774 many of us who are nonbelievers in god but still believers in morality
1061775 we are not responsible for what genes might do but we are increasingly becoming responsible for what we can do to genes and thus what altered genes will do
1061776 help mediate between sufferers and the moral and theological resources necessary for them to find meaning in their suffering
1061777 common factors in the queries of those who suffer include the elements of tragedy the inescapable fact of suffering the haunting awareness of choices made and demanded the confusion of being enmeshed in a situation that surpasses comprehension
1061778 common aspects of the kind of responsiveness suggested for clinicians are expressed in recurring words and phrases hearing receiving holding patient stories respectful witnessing being fully present open to both disturbing inquiries and to the possibility of mediating consolation accepting expressions of non sense honoring them as paradoxically meaningful offering oneself or someone else as companion for the quest

1061812 it might just be my best for some reason theres a cohesiveness here thats not like anything ive done before but at the same time its not real predictable theres a lot of texture to it as well but its a simple record i dont know how that happened but i know it when i hear it
1061813 fraizer did not do himself any harm against espanyol on saturday and i would not expect sir alex to say anything else at this stage

1061816 i dont want to sell him ive no intention this is a player who can be absolutely massive for us
1061817 i think niko got fitter last season and hell be back this year fitter again
1061818 i feel he can get better as well hes a real class act hes still only young and improving all the time
1061819 he can keep going on and become one of the best players in the premier league if he keeps improving
1061820 ive been very impressed with him and im pleased that weve got him here
1061821 i like him very much hes a good kid and hes got the potential to become a very good player
1061822 someone rung me and recommended him we got him down here and we liked what we saw straight away
1061823 theres a big gulf at the club between senior players and young kids weve got nothing in between really but i think he can bridge that gap
1061824 hes played out wide and through the middle for us in pre season but hes a forward player really
1061825 the investigating agencies did not do their job so we inquired into the matter and gathered documentary evidence in the case
1061826 it is not the critic who counts not the one who points out how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds might have done better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred with sweat and dust and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes short again and again who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause who if he wins knows the triumph of high achievement and who if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat
1061827 god gave me a life and im living it fully gosh darnnit

1061830 officers at the site of the oscar de la hoya floyd mayweather jr boxing match came running when they spotted a man later identified as albrecht grabbing a woman by the throat with both hands and dragging her toward the valet parking station at the mgm grand the officers who arrested albrecht said that he had grabbed his companion around the neck so hard that he left red marks and that they had to physically break his grip to free her
1061831 that his girlfriend had pissed him off and that he was the ceo of hbo
1061832 in 1991 the cable network hbo paid a major settlement to sasha emerson a subordinate and love interest of albrechts who alleged that he had shoved and choked her at hbos west coast offices in century city the incident according to four people familiar with the matter had been kept quiet for 16 years by the management of hbo
1061833 rarely does an executive that high in a corporate structure fall out without taking some of the people he put in with him insiders are wondering who will follow albrecht out the door
1061834 everything in his power not to televise mixed martial arts
1061835 represented a marked shift in hbos corporate culture in the past an hbo chief executive officer would not have ordered sports programming over the objection of the sports department
1061836 mixed martial arts is entertaining but the kind of skill level you saw in the ring tonight theres nothing in mixed martial arts which is within light years of what mayweather and de la hoya are able to do with their hands
1061837 i disagree with jim i think there are mixed martial artists who are operating on a very similar skill level in what they do as these fighters mayweather and de la hoya and thats one of the reasons why that sport is becoming very popular
1061838 this fight never would have materialized if boxing was dying its alive and well
1061839 the sport of boxing is alive and well if it isnt how do you explain this the naysayers can go take a nap
1061840 i went to the fight that night inside the arena there was no energy whatsoever im not bashing boxing i love it but all these people have destroyed this sport its crazy it just drives people further from boxing you get one fight for 55 bucks one fight for a 2 500 ticket you get people all excited for the build up and then the fight ends up sucking both guys try to outpoint the other and win a decision
1061841 in the ufc we give you eight or nine fights theyre all good and the guys are fighting their asses off trying to finish it
1061842 when we were talking about ways to mark 50 years since bobby moores debut there was only one true gesture that would do him justice retiring the number six shirt he made his own

1061844 we do all the things local radio used to do
1061845 we give out details of lost pets we publicise coffee mornings and the police come in once a week and talk about crimes in the area
1061846 i get stopped in the street by people and end up pumping them for their opinions
1061847 at the end of the day it makes no difference to me because if the public doesnt approve it its not going to pass anyway
1061848 i would hope that the medical staff can take a look at it before its done
1061849 every doctor i know is concerned that this contract is going to change dr chaudhuri from being a failed manager to majority owner of the district
1061850 es decir que por ejemplo cualquiera podr a buscar al juez que vive al lado de su casa para pedirle a medianoche y en pijama que detenga la rotativa de un peri dico alegando un estado de indefensi n ante una noticia

1061852 los tratados y otros instrumentos internacionales que establezcan alianzas pol ticas o militares
1061853 one thing more before i leave you to rest or gather up your itinerary there is some one here from the golden state whom i would like you to meet he is not an accomplished person like ourselves but as such he can know and yet be free to do things that we cant or at the very least he can involve himself with these things at a different kind of cost
1061854 i dont i did not bring you here to trick you into revealing things i want you to know exactly my intentions and if i can inspire you my hope is that you will feel free to talk about what has always inspired you the business and politics of your country are not a mystery to me i was educated in your universities and while culture is something you have to live in order to truly know i need to know whatever you can tell me about fulfilling expectations about identifying expectations that can be fulfilled if i learn well we become friends and i have the means to make sure that there is no limit to what we can learn from each other about where our peoples are going
1061855 i think eventually we are we advance at our pace you at yours within the sez our domestic productivity emerges much the same way language emerges everywhere in the world the way a words effectiveness emerges from its usage not from its obscure specific origin some would say that in our experimental quarter of the city we decide what to make after we decide how to make it this is not quite so our networks make it possible to do the how and the what at the same time and anyone who wishes to can participate in the entire development process
1061856 one guy starts washing his socks in his helmet and pretty soon everybodys doing it
1061857 i would add that the larger significance of this experiment is not about the process the significance is only truly apparent at the personal level being in the landscape freedom from abject stress the energy one gets from ones surroundings in the environment that our emergent style of production provides you will see how we have recovered parts of old blagovesh chensk to this end
1061858 so you figure the better you get at pumping stuff through the malls and the big box stores the better you can use consumerism to fund an alternative to consumerism
1061859 i wont deny that but we are really only working with inevitabilities officially the party is allowing this experiment given the advances in communication technology everywhere i dont see that they have any real choice
1061860 listen wang have you ever seen a kid being told they cant do something who made it a point to contradict whatever they were told in any way possible
1061861 in english the idiom cant may be you are not able and often may mean you are not allowed as well
1061862 right how about both at the same time youre not allowed to do whatever and they think youre incapable so you shouldnt even be attempting it
1061863 think of somebody who has the best of everything who makes everybody glad to be exactly whoever they happen to be who seems to have an unlimited ability to tell right from wrong yet breaks all the rules and never gets caught or when they do get caught it just makes them stronger or the perfect martyr who can only do one thing well and thats all they ever want to do or who seems to be able to do anything they pick up
1061864 its my job to project an image of myself as all of that and or sell you something that promises to give you at least some of that image
1061865 i think its mostly that last part selling the promise that youll want to know about
1061866 so who is this person you want me to meet mr wang
1061867 ask your doctor if metabolic and or circadian streamlining is right for you
1061868 the same reasons that brought you here besides we have a mutual friend here
1061869 when i want to talk to somebody i find out where they are and i go there i cant walk down the street at home but i can do better i can find a remote place to just show up where the people who accost me are probably going to be interesting even if they say and ask all the usual things their way of life will make it a whole new experience and i never rat around at all you know how i avoid all the common rock star bad behavior when things get slack i spend hours playing solitaire no other games just solitaire
1061870 what can you tell me about how anybody can still stand at the top of the music world the last generation to create legendary sales for anybody measured in platinum was the class of 1989 boy bands and throughout the nineties and beyond nobody sold half that and yet and yet today no webpage seems to be more than two clicks away from your songs or videos so how do you do it
1061871 look when i see all the user produced content i see despair i see a million people who have faced down the blank sheet of paper ripped their heart out and lost with no way to turn back there isnt a single person putting up their homemade tunes to be downloaded for free who wouldnt trade most of their soul for a tiny part of the recognition we get the shame is that theyre trading it for nothing
1061872 dreams evaporated be careful what you wish for and you know what i say to that person go back to the mall tout some toys get a crush on somebody make a fool of yourself and make it a priority to do some no risk notoriety to get your name in the toss so that everybody will keep you in the basic staples and provisions for life as we know it wider notoriety fame is a wasteland tell me which universally appealing thing you want to say and let me say it its much more effective that way
1061873 you are deluded and thats what i like about you
1061874 how often do you think you can randomly download something that isnt saccharine and naive or where they arent trying to sell out with every note that they play
1061875 there are lots of bigger celebrities than me these days
1061876 yeah but even worse than that they lets just say that all theyve ever really done is make themselves well known
1061877 not me plenty of people are definite about doing everything for personal gain and nothing for life in general but i dont think everybody thinks that way that would be cynical
1061878 because as i keep telling everybody it is me singing the secret is that it feels good to sing so i do it for hours and hours every day the rest is just editing this phrase goes in these five thousand tunes and this one goes in these eight thousand theres a lot of labor involved just not by me but the instrumental stuff is all software youve heard the ones we do sometimes where we just replace some of the instruments or the vocals we dont need the master tracks its similar to digitally altering photographs the trick is in isolating anything in what is essentially linear a single waveform
1061879 yeah all one tone with overtones very impressive but arent you just using all that to recycle flavors that any particular person hasnt quite gagged on yet
1061880 is it even the music at all couldnt it be that they just want to identify with somebody who looks like non stop glamour and festivity
1061881 you mean fun i am having fun not only does it optimize my mental health to sing for hours every day its also great for my well being to dance in mega doses with my friends
1061882 when you bought that music recognition notation software from jimi nailed the rights and refused to license it you denied that quintessence to every person who has music in their soul and no means to let it out the only way i can hum a few dozen bars and have that turn into a symphony or a folk song is if i use your empire your tools and your rules about what a symphony or a folk song can be
1061883 the code goes up on the web right after you publish this piece
1061884 besides youre betraying your own thesis everybody has music in their soul and some means to get it out there its just a question of giving it a form that meets enough other peoples expectations what weve been doing is paint by numbers compared to what the world will do with that code i wanted to be the one to say so can we stop arguing now
1061885 oh just thoreau distrust any enterprise that requires new clothes you know as in emperor
1061886 how can people possibly take the idea of royalty seriously today
1061887 im not actually that nice guy easy but im a good guy and im your guy
1061888 no this is a mixed industrial residential district no shops
1061889 back on the antonov were all bozos on that plane
1061890 i havent thought about going anywhere how did you get in
1061891 george king hes not doing a concert here does he even do concerts anymore
1061892 hes in the hospital just down the road your governor or imperial wizard or whatever flew him here
1061893 called every authority in a thousand miles and wang offered to send a plane to bring him back here seemed pretty anxious to see him
1061894 but not like a fan its like a diplomatic thing
1061895 get out of the music industry and go to work for the state department
1061896 then why was i at a meeting two weeks ago about a huge new site with open apis and new forms for samples out and mixes in
1061897 i didnt say he was going to stop supporting his music
1061898 yeah he wants to run for governor you think he wants to be governor no way its just pr
1061899 and youre no less important in what you do than ever but that doesnt mean you know all thats down the road
1061900 okay now ill say it if you want to get back on that plane just stick with the passports and visas
1061901 not you if i have anything to say about it
1061902 ive been off the map here for a long time and just about everything has worked out okay
1061903 the boss is in the hospital and you brought us here
1061904 i didnt bring anybody anywhere listen to what im saying
1061905 is there an end to this i need something to eat besides half an orange and some bread
1061906 there are some fast food places and a couple of tea rooms in town that might be open by the time you get there ill try to get you a car wangs people
1061907 deny whatever you need to but dont tell me to think that were here for no special reason at all
1061908 hold on im still listening but do you have a phone
1061909 someday im going to ask the wrong thing and have to do something significant to make it up to them
1061910 i dont have a real specific job description myself just tying up the last loose ends at borders nobody else has to worry about final entry details or where their passports might be stashed hotel reservations i grew up with that stuff
1061911 if you do go with a career in diplomacy it might have to be a new kind where its okay that the messages are garbled i think were going to be needing that kind more than ever
1061912 he probably thinks you only want to win the argument that he created no other purpose just one up on him what does that tell you
1061913 that hes nervous i dont seem to be reassuring him
1061914 hes not giving you much to work with id say let him find out whats up from somebody else unless youre worried about being left out in the cold
1061915 i can find a way home or a new home if that works better its just that whatever george is up to is going to be real interesting
1061916 its easy for some people to mistake enthusiasm anticipation and especially expectation for aggressive ambition
1061917 the best medicine for bad religion is not no religion but good religion
1061918 el grupo de asamble stas era diverso y no era especializado en hacer constituciones por lo que se trabajaba en procura de hacer un buen documento que regir al pa s no por unos a os sino por d cadas por tanto lo que importaba era debatir suficientemente cada aspecto para hacer una carta clara y s lida
1061919 trabajamos hasta las madrugadas como lo hizo mucha gente de la asamblea y procuramos estar atentos a todos los cambios que se realizaban en los textos lo cual permiti ver que muchos de esos textos fueron dr sticamente modificados
1061920 este requisito se elimin con lo que cualquier persona puede ser candidato a asamble sta a cualquier regi n conozca o no la realidad de esa regi n

1061923 cada vez que las objeciones vienen de algunos sectores incluso del propio gobierno de que significar a que todos los decretos y libros deben estar en quichua es una caricaturizaci n del hecho para poder oponerse me parece que hay una sobrevaloraci n del concepto de oficial con fines de ridiculizar algo que es elemental
1061924 el castellano es el idioma oficial del ecuador el castellano el kichwa quichua y el shuar son idiomas oficiales de relaci n intercultural los dem s idiomas ancestrales son de uso oficial para los pueblos ind genas en las zonas donde habitan y en los t rminos que fija la ley el estado respetar y estimular su conservaci n y uso
1061925 see that guy in the orange jersey behind that fat russian guy belov thats me thats your dad
1061926 greetings mr king how are you feeling this week the doctor looked dubious as he was leaving
1061927 he doesnt approve of my festive ways he suggested that i encourage people to live lives without structure weve had a few discussions about it
1061928 such dour persons are rare here a doctor sees much drama you are his first rock star
1061929 missionaries have complicated things in this part of the world
1061930 hmh well then what do you think your people should be doing with their lives
1061931 you could tell the doctor that programs are for machines not for people
1061932 how does that sit with your way of running things
1061933 i was sorry to see our collectives fail in the early days of the republic but my government did not see the complete true nature of labor and economy
1061934 i am here to give you a lecture and then i hope to be your student
1061935 the reason that it is unproductive for us to live like ants is that each ant only connects to the network at a few points of purpose and in the same way as a flock of birds or a school of fish the ant colony wants to function only as a mass
1061936 trying to influence order instruct everybody to sing the same song is highly problematic no matter how good the song is at the same time once people depart from the idea that we are all in this together the conflicts and consequences tend toward pathological yet another rationale for lobotomy i remain undiscouraged i believe we are ever more advancing conditions where one person does not have to lose in order for another to win planning for that requires my best effort
1061937 it makes no difference what you are into or what your religion or politics tell you
1061938 im in a position like the doctor we both have to see the mechanism of people how all the parts work together we both have to reason that while a person is not a machine dna is a program what is important is to not think of that program as industrial life is emergent dna is the original open source program
1061939 over the last twenty five years we have had to accept facts that had been common for the previous fifty years in western industrialized countries children were taught a cross pollination of ideas that their fathers and mothers needed them to have for career success but these have been ideas that those fathers and mothers continually knew nothing about now that we are living in a casual information disruption happening at even the lowest education levels down to the factory floor since everyone has access to the internet there is more and more resistance to hierarchy every day much of the time this involves the kind of creative enterprises that a man like you might develop
1061940 here is what i would like to learn about from you a group of people who follow fads or orders arent even as effective as a colony of ants or bees an ant that acts on a tiny number of chemical messages from other ants is acting out of direct devotion buying the right hat is just as directly devotional even a neanderthal had more capacity for possibilities than an ant bees and ants dont see the big picture we can but instead of seeing the ways our small part in it can be effective each persons unique macro view we are intimidated down to the lowest common denominator perfect consumers and their dubious consequences this is your world mr king
1061941 you dont have a lot of people to talk to do you wang
1061942 ministers advisors research people i hesitate to ask them to step out of roles they believe in this is sad but too often inevitable so yes i tend give as much of my analysis as possible before listening you will find that i do try to have conversations
1061943 its the way life on earth has been since the beginning
1061944 the universe aside from life is like a cup of coffee and cream
1061945 but for a short interval along the way life taps into to the energy streaming off the dying universe manages to make cells to live in and somehow probably without any plan billions of those cells eventually come together as us
1061946 you can argue what kind of intelligence that all this might imply but to ignore that it comes together from the very bottom of all things to deny its evolution would not be very intelligent
1061947 if youve been in groups who were trying to reach consensus you know that it depends on the power you have the available resources and the seriousness of the outcome but an active network of information has a way of spreading those costs and reducing the desperation authoritarian decisions frequently have dubious if not tragic consequences so the only substantiation for hierarchies is a perception of orderliness the problem is that we never question the idea that all of our fortunate consequences derive from that orderliness if order actually even exists in the authoritarian ways we perceive
1061948 a person in my position is never really in charge in the way of a person driving a car unless you imagine the car with a steering wheel like a bush growing out of the dashboard and imagine the peddles as toy balloons drifting around on the floor at your feet
1061949 what i actually do is set goals and assign resources then watch how well production maps itself ill admit that simulations have prevented disasters
1061950 we always used to watch the olympics as a family growing up
1061951 my dream was winning a gold medal for the united states
1061952 now even though the dream changed a little bit its been kind of bigger than i expected in a way because this story has caught the world by storm im wondering why this girl from south dakota got caught up in this worldwide story
1061953 i need to learn the language im working on it ive only been over there for a year or two and its a difficult language i know a few words but i need to get a lot more words most of the girls speak english so its fine
1061954 if people really do have a hard time with it they should take it up with the olympic committee or fiba im playing well within the rules and i think its a little strange it happens all the time in the olympics for people to get maybe upset or bent out of shape about me is strange because this is something the united states has done many times
1061955 there have been many foreign athletes that have come and competed for the u s and won medals
1061956 i think everyone wants to see the russia america matchup
1061957 if i have to play the united states obviously im going to go out there and compete to win but thats not what i want i know its what everyone else wants but its not what i want
1061958 once the ball went up it was just another basketball game
1061959 you want to meet the u s as late as possible
1061960 i have been playing against those players for 10 years i think when the ball goes up its just going to be another basketball game you just go out there and compete and enjoy the moment since its not going to happen again
1061961 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and im really looking forward to it
1061962 im glad im not doing as many interviews now just being able to be here and play basketball i think its been put off in the back of my mind for so long just concentrating on what weve been doing in the wnba and now is the first time ive been able to be over here and enjoy the experience
1061963 id love to go watch even if were not taking part in it i hear its pretty tremendous
1061964 im still learning most of the girls on the team three or four of them ive already played with and i have a history with them they are really a good group of girls they are really sweet they have made me feel very welcome and tried to get me accustomed to them very quickly and build chemistry on and off the court
1061965 maria stepanova came up to me and said i was initially against having an american on our team but now that i know you you can play with us any day
1061966 im looking to do something different that the sport has never seen

1061972 we are very happy with the recognition from the university of mumbai especially in the current scenario where students are unable to gain admission into the choice of stream and choice of college despite scoring a higher percentage the a level eligibility guidelines from the university of mumbai will benefit the students especially in the science stream since the students prepare only for 4 subjects the a level syllabus covers the mh cet syllabus to a significant extent this will be useful for all the students preparing for their competitive entrance examination

1062022 he was always so casual that people didnt realise his inner strength in the pool
1062023 he always won his races but we didnt take any notice
1062024 we thought the other kids must not have been any good
1062025 security is very tight but we have to give him his credit card because his visa card expired in kuala lumpur
1062026 hes probably the best prepared for the olympics than hes ever been but you dont know what to expect
1062027 its nerve racking watching your children in sport id hate it if he chose tennis and we had to sit through four or five hour matches
1062028 he keeps in touch every day my little darling calls me with a progress report if he hasnt called i want a text message to know hes all right
1062029 if hes down were down its a rollercoaster i can tell just by the tone of his voice how hes feeling and if he sounds tired i always say dont overdo it and get sick
1062030 he might decide to swim on we have to wait until this is over
1062031 it is good to get off to a good start
1062032 the boys have performed well and it is good to come in and get off to a winning start
1062033 it has been a bit of rollercoaster to be fair
1062034 the talent is here you can see it on display the players are here as well it is a good set up and lets hope this season can be a good one
1062035 im english speaking in japan my laptop has windows xp professional japanese ive a major problem with microsoft websites most of the pages come in japanese for example when i access windows live ideas i get japanese page and i have no idea how to view the english page opens in english but when i click on support it opens japanese page this is very difficult as i have very limited knowledge of japanese help
1062036 the vast majority of families simply dont have enough to eat
1062037 but now im thinking of sending them out to work to help out instead
1062038 torture has done tremendous damage to americas reputation around the world violates u s and international law and makes it harder to fight the war on terror its time to turn this page in our nations history and outlaw torture and secret detentions once and for all
1062039 this legislation is already in the intelligence authorization bill but we believe we have an obligation to ensure its passage so were introducing it as a separate piece of legislation as well we will pursue every legislative option until we finally outlaw torture and secret detentions by americas intelligence agencies
1062040 the presidents misguided interrogation policies have damaged our nations reputation and hindered our counterterrorism efforts
1062041 changing these policies has been a priority for the senate intelligence committee for two years but we have been blocked by the president and senate republicans today i join senators feinstein and hagel and other members in sending a clear signal that the u s intelligence community will not engage in torture
1062042 the bush administrations embrace of torture and secret detentions has led our country down a dark hallway
1062043 never again should the practices of our government turn so far away from the values of our people i hope these measures will help put right what has gone so badly wrong and restore the stature and goodwill and support this nation had earned around the world before this administration took office these measures are vital to cooperating with our allies and winning the war on terrorism
1062044 my desktop pc was purchased in uk but now i live in us however microsoft com and google com still treat me as having a gb locale how do i force us locale
1062045 the contributions that tony and sam have made to nevada county and the fairgrounds are significant
1062046 their tireless efforts and work have created a better and safer fair for our community
1062047 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the u s hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
1062048 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
1062049 its important to note that the new estimate does not represent an actual increase in the number of new infections but reflects our ability to more precisely measure hiv incidence and secure a better understanding of the epidemic
1062050 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease
1062051 too many americans continue to be affected by this disease
1062052 these new findings emphasize the importance of reaching all hiv infected individuals and those at risk with effective prevention programs
1062053 prevention can and does work when we apply what we know
1062054 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact
1062055 these data confirm the critical need to revitalize prevention efforts for gay and bisexual men of all races and to build upon the growing momentum in the african american and hispanic communities to confront hiv
1062056 we must all remember that we are dealing with one of the most insidious infectious diseases in history reducing this threat will require action from everyone individuals at risk community leaders government agencies and the private sector
1062057 we have e mailed all the physicians who fled iraq because of the deteriorated security situation asking them to return and develop the health service after remarkable progress in the security situation
1062058 the ministry went through an acute situation as a result of the dearth of senior physicians but now most doctors have expressed a readiness to return to their institutions and resume work
1062059 since the beginning of this year we have managed to overcome about 50 percent of the problems we faced in the past
1062060 we all agree that there is an improvement in the security situation but this thing is still fragile
1062061 and the most important thing is the difficulties one would have leaving iraq a second time if the security situation worsened again because of the difficulty of getting iraqi exit visas i would prefer to stay until early next year and see
1062062 the candle for tibet initiative is a most wonderful thing
1062063 we seem powerless to ameliorate conditions on the ground in the present crisis moment this peaceful prayer vigil since it focuses the minds of many millions on the different sufferings of tormented and tormentor alike is a powerful way to intervene and it does not preclude anything else we can think of and do further on i hope everyone who reads this will join in this important effort
1062064 mr thurmans support of our efforts is very encouraging and inspiring
1062065 it reinforces the importance of our non violent action and the power it will have for the people of tibet
1062066 can windows xp or server 2003 display all of the characters supported in unicode 3 0 or 4 0
1062067 so what does microsoft mean when it uses the words
1062068 keno is especially a bad form of gambling in large part because it takes place mainly in drinking establishments
1062069 the governor should be ashamed of himself for putting state spending ahead of the good of ohioans
1062070 the conclusion that ive reached is that this expansion of the lottery is important in enabling us to avoid raising taxes while continuing to meet the basic fundamental responsibilities of this government to serve the people
1062071 they local residents were exposed to cattle rustling after security was withdrawn to deal with the post election violence
1062072 there were also high levels of poverty in the area after the conflict
1062073 this system enabled the beneficiaries to get easy access to the cash and they could buy necessary food immediately
1062074 we thought the best way of getting effective aid to these people was cash
1062075 if the markets work there is no point in us buying goods taking them to the area and distributing them we might not get the type of goods required right and there are also issues to do with trucking food cash made much more sense
1062076 these people are mobile so they can go wherever they can get cheap food and the mobiles reduced their isolation
1062077 if there is money the food will come merchants will come people suffer because they cant buy
1062078 we found that one mobile phone per large group of people is not enough we will need to get more phones
1062079 most of the projects that have used the mobile phone technology have been small in scale and preliminary probably due the high costs of developing and deploying mobile technologies
1062080 provided the difference between wholesale and retail prices is within a certain range local food markets are actually functioning and that the cash transfer programme is long enough to justify the costs of the equipment phones chargers etc
1062081 it was a whole culture to boys and the tougher the outfit was such as airborne or marines thats where black boys would go segregation had a lot to do with that because you see to be a man you couldnt be a man in georgia in terms of your presentation you were always a boy but in the marines you were a man so thats why it was considered a rite of passage
1062082 one of atlantas great coaches joseph judo brown taught me the importance of helping those less educationally and financially fortunate
1062083 he encouraged us to be like big brothers to young athletes that stayed with me all of my life
1062084 well a friend my neighbor had heard about the peace corps and she suggested that since i was so adventurous maybe it would be something i would be interested in doing
1062085 there was a group of close to 40 volunteers in different sections in my group there were at least 2 volunteers who were deselected
1062086 in the afternoons we studied french which was also very difficult we spent a lot of time in class at springfield college studying physiology and all the physical sports
1062087 senegal was the most educated of all the french speaking countries in africa because all of the african leaders were trained in dakar
1062088 the peace corps wanted us to speak almost perfect french but i couldnt speak it fluently they gave me an opportunity anyway and i became one of the top peace corps volunteers because i learned french and wolof by walking the streets of dakar and speaking to people many people thought i was senegalese because of my complexion it made it easy for people they look up to americans and people feel at ease when you make an effort to speak their language it was a cultural and spiritual connection
1062089 that was where many of the slaves were sent from west africa from what was called the house of no return as i visited goree and walked through that slave house the emotions the spirituality it seemed like everything mixed into one
1062090 captives were forced to leave their country on slave ships and they would never see their homeland again there were armed guards standing with rifles and if the slaves refused to leave they would be shot many captives drowned themselves in the ocean rather than become slaves
1062091 it was very powerful for any person particularly african americans to revisit that experience
1062092 i didnt choose harvard my former peace corps training officer and friend dr robert binswanger was teaching there and i happened to meet him on the streets of cambridge mass he encouraged me to have lunch with a group of men at harvard but i didnt realize it was an interview and that is how i ended up at harvard
1062093 i wanted to be a principal but i wasnt certified so the hanover new hampshire school district gave me the opportunity to obtain certification it was on the job training absolutely
1062094 i became the first african american principal in hanover new hampshire in 1973 i stayed there two years it was amazing being a principal in a basically all white state in an all white school district there were two african americans a teacher and myself
1062095 the students really were very open and likable i got along with them very well but it was culturally and socially very isolating
1062096 but i was able to learn from my supervisors including the superintendent of schools who were also harvard graduates
1062097 east orange was an urban school district with a lot of urban problems even in hanover interestingly enough there was a lower income community that had the same urban problems like urban kids in east orange
1062098 i wanted to raise the standards of education and develop a program where students would become worldly so i developed cross cultural programs and a french immersion program where students would learn to speak french and wolof
1062099 at first the students parents were very upset because they couldnt see any reason why their black children should learn how to speak french
1062100 learning another language forces you to think in a different way but it also increases your capacity to be more analytical and it will help you in other subjects even now i think in french so often
1062101 there was a great change in terms of the social values of parents
1062102 but my rewards are that as i walk the streets of washington new york or atlanta i run across many of my former students who are doing so well in business law and other professional fields
1062103 recently i just happened to be in a restaurant in washington d c when a young man came up to me and said youre dr weaver do you remember what you taught me about africa you taught me about the culture and the people im celebrating i was named the public relations director for the baltimore wizards that was a beautiful experience
1062104 it is important for our school systems to teach nutrition and proper health habits
1062105 you have to have a proper diet and that has to be emphasized over and over
1062106 my son toure and my daughter yvette began good habits at an early age and theyve always been conscious of health eating habits and working out my wife mimi is a gourmet cook who prepares healthy nutritious meals she walks and takes yoga
1062107 i train kids to run faster and increase their ability to become good athletes but most importantly good human beings
1062108 i used to train at the ny giants training camp dave megget of the ny giants and other players used to call me that because i could run short distances as fast as some of their players
1062109 we are concerned about what will happen to the dead sea when this amount of marine water is pumped into it
1062110 even with the conduit whether it goes ahead or not the river jordan needs to be rehabilitated
1062111 we object to the world bank identifying together with the governments a group of experts who have been picked by the water authorities
1062112 these days you sometimes go out there and come back empty handed
1062113 my income has declined by over 70 percent and the impact on my familys livelihood is serious i am struggling to make ends meet trying to establish other businesses to balance the situation
1062114 i have had to change my childrens schools to ones that i can afford
1062115 the fishing business is no longer sustainable and many of my friends feel frustrated i am thinking about selling some of my assets to diversify my options i am beginning to fail to provide some essential needs for my family
1062116 this has been brought about by carelessness of both the communities and governments along the lake we dont know how long it will go on because we have talked to everybody who could listen but the authorities are more interested in development
1062117 but information indicates that only 10 percent of the sewage gets treated
1062118 we have many players licensed to go fishing by local governments to mitigate this we are planning to again centralise licensing because local governments are more interested in the revenue not conservation
1062119 we were earning over 150 million from fish exports in the past years but i dont think that we shall even earn 90 million this year
1062120 anybody attracted by the huge demand available on the market can get his boat and line up his gear to start fishing
1062121 this has created a lot of pressure on the lake and the fishing gear used is not the best to allow the resource to renew
1062122 we also plan to promote the use of fishing gear that allows the fish to grow as mostly young fish are being caught currently
1062123 the flower factories are all located along the lake in all three countries and they use a lot of chemicals that end up in the lake
1062124 over 75 percent of the wetlands have been significantly affected by human activities and 13 percent are severely degraded
1062125 population growth around the continents largest lake is significantly higher than the rest of africa
1062126 if they are not managed properly the continents lakes face loss of sustainability for future generations
1062127 from the preliminary results cyanobacteria like anabaena were found in the water samples these can be very toxic for plants and animals including humans because of the toxin microcystin
1062128 they can accumulate in the fish tissues liver intestines and gallbladder which means that secondary contamination by eating toxic fish from an infected pond or lake is possible
1062129 the companies agreed to reduce this carcinogenic chemical in fried potatoes a victory for public health and safety in california
1062130 other companies should follow this lead and take steps to reduce acrylamide in french fries and potato chips
1062131 the hell im the young one the one that had the baby not the near death experience the healthy one are you looking at the right persons rate

1062135 the senate is currently conducting an internal investigation in an attempt to discover who is behind this once we learn their identity that information will be turned over to law enforcement and we would expect it to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law

1062137 nikki is one of my really dear friends and shes not a person that i would ever expect to have that controversy surrounding her
1062138 but at the same time you know things get misconstrued in this business
1062139 i really hope the best for her because shes one of the sweetest girls ive ever met so i just hope it works out and it will because shes a good person and good things happen to good people
1062140 that means the ads are totally calvin totally provocative and a little controversial
1062141 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public

1062148 if john mccain wants to meet me anywhere anytime to have a debate about our respective policies in iraq in iran in the middle east or around the world that is a conversation i am happy to have
1062149 i believe that there is no separation between john mccain and george bush when it comes to our middle east policy and i think their policy has failed
1062150 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
1062151 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider

1062153 i wish we could open the scrimmages for our fans but we are adding a few wrinkles and its better for us if we can work on those things in a scrimmage setting without restraint
1062154 i hope the fans that want to see us before the season begins can take advantage of the open practices we appreciate their support and i know its a lift for our team to see them too during this time of year when our players and coaches are working so hard

1062163 i started coming back in about 1979 because my parents moved back which i couldnt understand what in the world would make you come back here it took me about 20 years to figure that out
1062164 given their checkered past and the difficulty that they had in getting to this point the bungling of the hatfill part of the investigation leads me to be very skeptical
1062165 ive been completely left out with regard to any understanding of the progress of the investigation or what these latest developments may mean

1062208 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1062209 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1062210 there is nothing left now but to ensure that my infant son does not meet the same fate as the rest of my doomed race
1062211 i will send him to a new planet where he will i hope be raised by simple but kindly country folk and grow up to be a hero and protector to his adopted home

1062219 he is a man of faith and direction and it shows very clearly in the character we see in the headlines and on television even in light of those rumors of him being muslim
1062220 john mccain is trying very hard to maintain his partys views continuing this war in iraq and tries to flaunt his foreign policy experience but hes playing a risky game with lives which in a way could equate with sen obamas views on abortion
1062221 we know the troops arent going to leave iraq immediately as someone gets into office because that would be irresponsible but i am more confident in the plan that sen obama has and we can look forward to that plan going into action
1062222 obama has got a good line he presents himself well but his walk does not follow his talk
1062223 some people said they would sit it out but if you do not vote for mccain then you are in effect putting obama in

1062228 i was being bullied by some of the kids at school
1062229 it appears a mountain lion attacked you and your classmates
1062230 you were the only one to not recieve wounds from the cat but you still got pretty beat up from those boys they got their just deserts if you ask me im just thankfull that youre alright train
1062231 let him be for now we should just be thankful someone spotted them all and train you should know that the others are fine theyll be back to school in 3 5 weeks
1062232 this might not be the best time to tell you this
1062233 what do you do for fun also do you have any hobbies
1062234 my favorites are about magic and dragons as for hobbies i like to run but im sometimes a klutz and trip over myself
1062235 some of the other students told me you read books too what are your favorites
1062236 i have to go pick up lunch from the store
1062237 the store is by the station near the school also you still havent introduced yourself friend
1062238 i cant skip school my grandparents if they found out would worry to much
1062239 you have to meet them it is really important you can use my cell phone if you need to call them
1062240 but ill have to be home by six o clock
1062241 my parents are going to go crazy when they meet you
1062242 youll know more soon enough the world you know is about to seem a lot less intersting
1062243 im a little bit of a klutz sometimes i will try to be more careful
1062244 im sorry i didnt tell you earlier but honestly youve never been able to do the same thing youre heimdalls son do you not have any powers that you think are strange if you react this way to a little mind reading maybe you shouldnt meet my parents
1062245 i dont have to be in skin contact with the person im reading
1062246 well take one of my hairs and tie it to our pinkies ill still be able to hear your thoughts that way
1062247 you have to promise me that no matter what you will always return to me that no matter what the situation we will always be together i know youre moving and if you cant stop it please keep in touch please promise me that youll return to me
1062248 theres no other explanation for this happening lets ditch the rest of the day and go see my parents the sooner this happens the better
1062249 anyways my dad is a little excentric please dont be put off by anything crazy he does also my mom is very well just dont be put off by anything she does
1062250 we find no evidence that menopause is common among wild chimpanzee populations
1062251 while some female chimpanzees do technically outlive their fertility its not at all uncommon for individuals in their 40s and 50s quite elderly for wild chimpanzees to remain reproductively active
1062252 fertility in chimpanzees declines at a similar pace to the decline in survival probability whereas human reproduction nearly ceases at a time when mortality is still very low
1062253 this suggests that reproductive senescence in chimpanzees unlike in humans is consistent with the somatic aging process
1062254 why hasnt reproduction kept pace with the general increase in human longevity it may be because there hasnt been anything for natural selection to act on though there is heritable variation in age of menopause
1062255 however it may be that the advantage older females gain by assisting their grandchildren outstrips any advantage they might get by reproducing themselves
1062256 we have many problems with our current methods of stem cell therapy like those taken from bone marrow

1062258 the cells can sense the patterns and they end up elongated in the direction of those grooves

1062271 we found that the concentrations of nutrients needed to start the florida red tides is much lower than previously suspected
1062272 the hypothesis means that offshore areas should be examined for both small increases in nutrients and modest concentrations of the algae at the start of the bloom season
1062273 this suggests that hominids on flores were making the same kinds of tools on the island for hundreds of thousands of years
1062274 our work has shown how important the learning process is when using brain controlled devices
1062275 by permitting the subject to adaptively recode the generated neural activity the overall performance of the device is dramatically increased
1062276 furthermore as we have progressed in this work it has become apparent that the basic idea of intention during learning is very important and can be addressed by the direct observation of the neuronal transformations taking place during this fundamental processing
1062277 the monkey developed a great deal of skill using this physical device
1062278 we are in the process of extending this type of control to a more sophisticated wrist and hand for the performance of dexterous tasks
1062279 classic understanding of brain function has asserted that one hemisphere or one side of the brain controls arm and leg movement on the opposite side of the body
1062280 this access provided us with insights that could not be obtained using other methods
1062281 this evidence demonstrates that the brain encodes information regarding planning for movements of the same sided limb and that this information is encoded in a way that is unique from that corresponding to opposite side limb movements
1062282 to allow these patients to benefit from the use of a brain computer interface signals for control for two sides of the body must be acquired from the single functioning hemisphere alone
1062283 in this paradigm one side of the body the side opposite to the unaffected half of the brain would be controlled through normal physiologic pathways and the other side of the body the side affected by the stroke and on the same side as the unaffected hemisphere would be controlled through neuroprosthetic assistance using same side signals from the undamaged hemisphere
1062284 the existence of these neurons offers the means of creating this mapping by relating neural activity of the patient to an action observed by that patient
1062285 the neural activity is congruent because the way that the neurons fire during observation of familiar action is the same as the way they fire when the individual is performing that same action
1062286 we varied visibility of the video task components in an attempt to gain a better understanding of what facilitates the neural congruency between observation and action
1062287 the study showed that the presence of the goal of an action bears a greater impact on the strength of this congruence while the observation of the motion to this goal carries minimal importance
1062288 our results lead us to believe that when presented with the observation of a familiar action the monkeys inadvertently generate a motor command that is very similar to one that would occur if the animal were to execute the behavior
1062289 it has allowed him to continue to direct a highly successful nih funded medical research program
1062290 the initial results indicate that the bci can function without close technical oversight and can improve communication ability and quality of life this initial success suggests that a home bci system can be of practical value for people with severe motor disabilities and that caregivers without special expertise can learn to support it
1062291 dr unethical is really worried about you she said doesnt want you to become another statistic and im sure mom and dad dont either you should be more careful youre smarter than that
1062292 i dont want to scare you but you need to go to the hospital now
1062293 what are the consequences of forcing everyone to use this
1062294 how can we provide more opportunities for our teachers and learners to find solutions that work for them
1062295 i like the fact that every two years you get a new car and you dont have to pay anything to return it
1062296 i cant drive a car for six or seven years i just cant do that
1062297 how much would you like to bet on what a cars worth three years from now given the circumstances
1062298 at a time when people are reconsidering their basic car buying decisions our business has been very strong
1062299 we dont feel the effects as much as a dealer or a bank or a manufacturer because people need transportation
1062300 we are excited that cyclone fans across the country will get to see the unveiling of our new uniforms by either watching the game on fcs central or our web site
1062301 weve worked cooperatively with fcs central in order to get live television coverage for this special occasion
1062302 fcs central will allow us to web cast its audio and video production of the game to our ever increasing web audience
1062303 certainly live programming of iowa state football via the web is highly coveted it has been very popular in previous trials
1062304 if they like you theyll say yes if they dont theyll make fun of you
1062305 if you asked someone out and they said no just telling everyone at school they raped you
1062306 not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
1062307 how can we punish the athletes who are not political how can we punish the other nations of the world and millions of proud patriotic fans by withdrawing our support
1062308 show them the spirit of freedom open their eyes to the greatness of our free system and they will embrace and emulate us
1062309 dont worry about what is around the next bend just concentrate on enjoying my presence and staying in step with me
1062310 our lord you have not created all this without purpose glory to you exalted be you above all that they associate with you as partners give us salvation from the torment of the fire
1062311 look this is whats going on here thats making me unhappy i need for this to change in order to stay with you

1062345 green carbon the role of natural forests in carbon storage
1062346 natural forests are more resilient to climate change and disturbances than plantations
1062347 protecting the carbon in natural forests is preventing an additional emission of carbon from what we get from burning fossil fuel
1062348 the majority of biomass carbon in natural forests resides in the woody biomass of large old trees commercial logging changes the age structure of forests so that the average age of trees is much younger
1062349 the carbon stock of forests subject to commercial logging and of monoculture plantations in particular will therefore always be significantly less on average than the carbon stock of natural undisturbed forests

1062431 the conference agreement provides for 14 6 billion in tax breaks and credits between 2005 and 2015 including 2 8 billion for fossil fuel production
1062432 this bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country the handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for people of arizona i cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency security and energy independence

1062434 while it contains some useful provisions it also contains massive pork slabs dished out to the vested interests who need them least like oil companies and has no overarching strategy to deal with the new world
1062435 what is left is a candy store of tax breaks and subsidies for both the highly profitable oil and gas companies and the more struggling alternative energy producers it is a bill that only industry executives and lobbyists could love and even they dont want their names on it

1062486 the honour of working with blind guardian was really the crowning of our extremely fruitful cooperation with ascaron after providing almost 500 engine ready 3d assets for sacred 2 including characters armour sets buildings weapons shields amulets and other equipment the fact that ascaron entrusted us with the in game models of the band members clearly shows that modern game development rivals hollywood not only by embracing top talent but by bravely implementing creative processes which are traditional in the world of movie making yet still somewhat emergent in our industry
1062487 if you dream about big things your partners must understand and share your vision and passion ascaron was not gambling for a professional production ascaron has chosen a professional collaboration blind guardian and 3d brigade

1062489 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making
1062490 what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those thirty years he was in washington for twenty six of them
1062491 and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil he voted against increased fuel efficiency standards and opposed legislation that included tax credits for more efficient cars he voted against renewable sources of energy against clean biofuels against solar power against wind power against an energy bill that while far from perfect represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country so when senator mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis its important to remember that hes been a part of that failure
1062492 i thought this was supposed to be over the phone

1062496 one of the great tour de forces i have seen in my life
1062497 these are the types of little tactical games they play and if you just ignore them or be afraid of them you can lose you go right after them say that is disgraceful of sen mccain i have been with the troops here here and here and to try and make this a political issue shame on him thats what i say
1062498 before i took over the policy was that you dont mix in primaries
1062499 and oftentimes the person to win the primary was not the best person for the general or the best senator now we actively try to persuade people to run
1062500 he understands the political environment like a medical doctor with a patient
1062501 all he is doing is helping to prescribe the right formula the rest is up to the democrats who are running and the voters who desire a new direction
1062502 bob schaffer the republican candidate in colorado is the gift that keeps on giving
1062503 susan collins the republican candidate in maine on every major vote has sided with george bush
1062504 al franken the democratic candidate in minnesota had his difficulties with taxes and his statements from his previous careers
1062505 give him credit for what he did for his country but right now voters are asking do you understand my plight and can you help make it a little better and i dont think mccain wins on either answer

1062509 in the current industry of customer frustration the last thing flight attendants want to do is add fuel to the fire

1062512 replacing our old recycled pillows and blankets with this state of the art high quality take home kit is an eco conscious health conscious and customer conscious decision

1062517 we need more nuclear power we need clean coal technology we need to offshore drill for oil and natural gas we need to drill now
1062518 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to meet the challenges we face or isnt giving the american people straight talk
1062519 we have to make a serious nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away
1062520 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power
1062521 the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since last rejected this idea two months ago is a slide in his poll numbers
1062522 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another

1062526 both of these processes create a lot of carbon dioxide
1062527 no one wants to invest in them in a world where were facing emissions caps
1062528 we always knew in principle that oil was exhaustible but now its beginning to look exhaustible
1062529 the more you use today the less you have tomorrow
1062530 anywhere it isnt essential people will switch away from oil
1062531 there were always a few students two three four percent of the class who were interested in the environment but for the most part if i brought up climate change id be greeted with yawns

1062591 he said that one of the reasons he needed to fence off his property was that when he was living in switzerland
1062592 he was interrupted so much he couldnt get any work done
1062593 hed always been a fairly enigmatic person and him making a public appearance to the local townspeople that went a long way with the folks in town
1062594 when the news media found out he was in cavendish they just descended on the town to find out everything they could people wouldnt tell them anything
1062595 no matter how late it was he seemed to be working
1062596 today the most insane wasteful spending program in america comes to an end
1062597 we will comply with any changes in federal law and we will be able to implement these changes easily
1062598 it was pretty amazing to think that people from your own town participated in some of the most decisive events of the 20th century really
1062599 this project allows the library to safely share personal histories photos and memorabilia with the general public by means of digital media these artifacts from personal collections would not otherwise be accessible to the general public
1062600 these stories might never be shared outside a small ring of family and friends without such a project
1062601 we heard that over and over and over again about how it was nice to go back through that stuff and almost relive and remember and many of the people had passed on since the last time they went through the stuff
1062602 to me it was always the photos because these people served in vastly different locations so their whole experience the cultural experience of each persons service is unique from the other persons
1062603 so when it came to photos it was photos of their friends serving in this location or pertaining to the job they did which was always different from everyone elses
1062604 some people were trying to celebrate the lives of their loved ones and others were just trying to get the story out there before its forgotten for the next generation of the family
1062605 and a lot of the family members didnt really know much about their relatives service or grandfathers service or anything like that
1062606 it was a huge undertaking much bigger than we had expected really
1062607 once we got the templates and that set up it was pretty well plug and chug everything along but the templates went over three or four revampings and changing and that kind of thing
1062608 what you think you want at the beginning isnt what you want at the end
1062609 a lot of these people they had double stories to tell
1062610 it makes us in todays world look like we ask for a lot
1062611 hope your readers might be able to help i am using sharepoints
1062612 the police were in the house searching it my belongings were taken away my computer and my diary i felt really violated
1062613 in hindsight i should not have crossed that boundary and i guess she might have got the wrong impression i was suffering from depression at the time and that affected my thinking
1062614 i accept i shouldnt have done it but i never expected anything like this i thought id be taken to one side and told to sort it out
1062615 it was 8am and i was still in my pyjamas when the police turned up they took me away and questioned me although by the second time i was questioned i got the feeling they knew there wasnt much in it
1062616 but the waiting has been horrendous its been a year of worsening fear
1062617 i lost my old house i felt like i was being watched all they time you know you havent done anything but i was scared to go out
1062618 its torn my family apart there was never any truth in it but youre never sure how its going to end
1062619 now for my daughters sake ive got to just get my life back on track hopefully now we can all move on
1062620 youre kicking doors down and taking weapons from people and getting shot at all day just heart thumping action nonstop
1062621 then all of a sudden youre in a low end construction job starting at the bottom its not an ego booster ill tell you that
1062622 a lot of my buddies went down the proverbial rat hole
1062623 when you get out youre starting at the bottom again so thats a blow to your ego
1062624 it was hard for me to just take orders from people who didnt know what id done
1062625 after six months when the money runs out you realize youre not being taken care of
1062626 you always had a paycheck no matter what you get out youve got to get a job
1062627 i got back in april 2007 got out in may
1062628 i cant do it a civilian job for more than a couple months and then i want to leave
1062629 its as close as i can get without going back in to the marines
1062630 i talked to mike and it was good it was a personal one on one thing
1062631 he can help you hes going to help you take advantage of the benefits
1062632 if theyre angry a lot just be patient with the person
1062633 its hard enough adjusting without people getting frustrated with you
1062634 were the walking wise weve gotten knowledge beyond our years
1062635 we have a small enough community that we can be here for them and help ease them back into the civilian world
1062636 they leave home for the military and its like a different mommy and daddy
1062637 they dont know where theyre going to eat next they dont know what theyre going to do next
1062638 this started out as a legitimate claim and it was an innocent mistake
1062639 she had a very strong relationship with her daughter and grandchildren but she doesnt see them now and that has caused immense distress to my client
1062640 the real punishment she has had to accept is life under the microscope
1062641 this started out as a legitimate claim and it was an innocent mistake
1062642 she is estranged from her daughter and is receiving no further funds from that source
1062643 it doesnt surprise me that you are a low risk of reoffending i have seen the toll these proceedings have taken on you and you have put yourself under house arrest for the last two years
1062644 leaving your house to come to court must have been a huge step i hope you have broken the back of whats been keeping you inside for the last two years and some good can come out of it
1062645 i doubt we will be seeing you in the criminal court again
1062646 i had been up feeding my youngest son samuel who was about 3 months old and the words baby planner popped into my head
1062647 i went downstairs and i googled baby planner and at that time i found two others i thought this is what people need and im not the only one that thinks it
1062648 all of these families usually dont have extended families around them
1062649 the landscape of america has changed and not all of us live around grandparents aunts uncles and cousins
1062650 ive been baby planning for six years because of my three sons timothy jacob and samuel but i started sweet pea baby planners in 2007 after realizing a huge need for parent preparation
1062651 initially when i became a parent i started asking my friends which is a natural thing to do what i needed
1062652 i was really struggling to take care of my baby and my 4 year old son noah
1062653 i didnt have any family to help out or a big support network to get help
1062654 it was just like talking to a friend i never got to meet
1062655 if an owner wants to service his car in that way it is his choice im not surprised thankfully an age of excess in some areas continues
1062656 you would think this is a business that deals with children so as soon as you hear something about someone left in there someone should have been rushing there to help
1062657 the outlook for small fuel efficient vehicles is much brighter today versus a year ago and the outlook on suvs has changed dramatically in the other direction
1062658 this started out as a legitimate claim and it was an innocent mistake
1062659 a decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer notices in the west today
1062660 and the decline in courage at times attaining what could be termed a lack of manhood is ironically emphasized by occasional outbursts of boldness and inflexibility on the part of those same functionaries when dealing with weak governments and with countries that lack support or with doomed currents which clearly cannot offer any resistance
1062661 the defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations
1062662 this tilt of freedom toward evil has come about gradually but it evidently stems from a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which man the master of this world does not bear any evil within himself and all the defects of life are caused by misguided social systems which must therefore be corrected
1062663 because instant and credible information is required it becomes necessary to resort to guesswork rumors and suppositions to fill in the voids
1062664 and yet no weapons no matter how powerful can help the west until it overcomes its loss of willpower
1062665 if as claimed by humanism man were born only to be happy he would not be born to die
1062666 even if we are spared destruction by war life will have to change in order not to perish on its own we cannot avoid reassessing the fundamental definitions of human life and society is it true that man is above everything is there no superior spirit above him
1062667 balfour feels that it would set a wrong precedent for him to meet the family of a convict because it means that anybody could just arrange a meeting with him
1062668 he wants them to follow the proper channels if they have a problem or concern then they must raise it with the local correctional services office and not him
1062669 we will no longer comment about schabirs health his life or his imprisonment
1062670 i cant say whether its true or not we just want the media to leave us alone schabir is in jail under the keep of correctional services
1062671 we sent our medical doctor and we received a report studied it and took a decision based on that report
1062672 after meeting with shaik we want to speak to the minister of correctional services ngconde balfour to discuss pardoning shaik from his sentence because of his ill health
1062673 at the time that shaik was sentenced president thabo mbeki granted all prisoners a 20 month amnesty that would effectively shorten their time in prison shaik was not sentenced by judge hilary squires until after this but he should also benefit from this amnesty

1062677 samuel es uno de los mejores jugadores del mundo no s lo que pasar con el club porque no es mi trabajo pero samuel es muy importante para nosotros y se ha visto que es un ganador
1062678 samuel siempre ha tenido un sitio en el bar a est trabajando al m ximo y eso es de admirar
1062679 generamos muchas ocasiones y marcamos muchos goles y eso me da mucha fe para seguir nos demuestran que si no lo hacen es porque no quieren se est n retratando ellos mismos porque lo est n haciendo a muy buen nivel
1062680 como todo el mundo se esfuerza defensivamente no tenemos problemas

1062689 under state law if a person does not show up for work for more than 14 days the department can separate that person from the department
1062690 youd have to ask him why he chose not to work and youd have to ask him why he chose to be voluntarily separated from the department
1062691 he has 10 days to appeal to the fire commissioner
1062692 this hasnt been brett favres team for a long time
1062693 hes a great quarterback and no matter where he goes hes going to continue to be a great quarterback you always look forward to playing against the best
1062694 hes a guy that you just never know what hes going to do so you just play
1062695 its fun playing against him because you know that you have to throw all the rules out of window wherever the ball goes you go
1062696 just his dedication to the game him as a person he was a great guy on the field and off the field
1062697 hed make you laugh hes just a great guy he would laugh and talk and joke with anybody i would have thought that after this season he had they would have welcomed him back
1062698 why wouldnt you let him come back if you dont want him to come back why wouldnt you trade him
1062699 especially since hes getting up in age youre mentally and physically tired and thats a hard time to make that decision for anybody most of the time you want to wait but the situation was what it was
1062700 hes actually 15 minutes from where i was born and raised in mississippi
1062701 so i always liked the opportunity to play against him just because i definitely know folks from home are going to be watching

1062706 looking at the whole team now four years on from athens new zealand sport is in really good shape
1062707 i think the potential for us across all sports including cycling is really exciting obviously putting that on to the court or the pitch or the track on the day is what the athletes are up against now which is the exciting part
1062708 but i think weve never had more potential as a sporting nation than weve got this year its exciting
1062709 its just how new zealanders have fared on the world stage over the last year 18 months
1062710 its been gradually building over the last few years across all sports thats the exciting bit
1062711 you know when you come to the olympic games youve got to be in some form of shape you know youre within the bubble to be able to perform the number of athletes now that are within that bubble are far more now than what weve ever had
1062712 we havent really had an example of blocking patterns for a year or so because of the la nina el nino also tends to encourage mobility and lots and lots of westerly winds but at the moment we have neither
1062713 with blocking it continues until it wants to break down and theres no real way of forecasting how long it may last it will go when it wants to go

1062771 some anc and alliance leaders seem to have a problem of the connection between their brains and their mouths
1062772 such an approach is more productive in that it takes us away from the idiosyncratic perspectives that we may have on how the anc should handle and deal with leadership he said in the past the shortest rout to the top position in the anc was social prominence
1062773 if you were a lawyer a doctor a journalist a farmer a chief one stood a better chance of being elected a leader
1062774 so there anc will always find ways to deal with its challenges both within and outside
1062775 limpopo conference is an event it will come and go but the challenge facing the party will always be the

1062804 in cablevisions view a network dvr is in essence simply a dvr with a very long cord
1062805 cable operators would no longer need to provide a unique piece of hardware for each individual subscriber in order to offer dvr functionality

1062856 the judgment of the holy see is that the activities of call to action in the course of these years are in contrast with the catholic faith due to views and positions held which are unacceptable from a doctrinal and disciplinary standpoint thus to be a member of this association or to support it is irreconcilable with a coherent living of the catholic faith
1062857 it isnt just the phoenix that rises from the ashes
1062858 oh poor tommy why on earth would you kick little timmy in the face until he died i guess well just have too teach you a lesson no desert for you young man
1062859 it isnt just the phoenix that rises from the ashes
1062860 as in 1969 i still regard jesus christ today as the chief focus of my perspective on god but not to the exclusion of other religious perspectives gods reality is not bound by one manifestation of the divine in jesus but can be found wherever people are being empowered to fight for freedom life giving power for the poor and the oppressed is the primary criterion that we must use to judge the adequacy of our theology not abstract concepts as malcolm x put it i believe in a religion that believes in freedom any time i have to accept a religion that wont let me fight a battle for my people i say to hell with that religion
1062861 the point that i would like to impress upon every afro american leader is that there is no kind of action in this country ever going to bear fruit unless that action is tied in with the overall international class struggle
1062862 for the marxist the truth is a truth of class there is no truth but the truth in the struggle of the revolutionary class
1062863 the appearance of black theology means that the black community is now ready to do something about the white jesus so that he cannot get in the way of our revolution
1062864 i try and read the blog everyday and have pointed it out to other faculty who have their students read it for class it is truly one of the best things in the blogosphere
1062865 businesses generally want to do the right thing its just learning to do it and figuring out how to afford it
1062866 it isnt just the phoenix that rises from the ashes
1062867 across history and cultures marriages single most fundamental idea is that every child needs a mother and a father changing marriage to accommodate same sex couples would nullify this principle in culture and in law
1062868 one can believe in same sex marriage one can believe that every child deserves a mother and a father one cannot believe both
1062869 its possible somebody could hide that from all of your co workers and nobody would ever hear about it
1062870 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
1062871 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
1062872 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
1062873 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
1062874 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
1062875 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
1062876 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
1062877 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
1062878 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
1062879 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
1062880 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
1062881 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
1062882 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
1062883 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
1062884 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
1062885 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

1062906 the best way i can describe veronica is shes just a champion

1062938 no ones ever going to tell you that you didnt win the contract because you were chewing gum the whole time
1062939 these things are cyclical because we get to a point where we treat each other so poorly with such disrespect for each other there comes a tipping point where people say i dont want to be treated like this so im not going to treat others like this
1062940 im afraid that typing in the street has become a basic human right
1062941 a written word is still the most formal version of communication so an email is still a legal document

1062949 the increase in alcohol related deaths for females and the decline for males across the two periods may result from several factors including the introduction of alcopops first sold in australia in 1995 which particularly target females
1062950 i think if we started to gather appropriate data in new zealand we would find the trend is no different an increasing amount of alcohol is being consumed by young women and that trend is led by alcopops
1062951 there is a major problem out there with young girls drinking alcohol
1062952 they dont realise that they are at far higher risk of alcohol related harm socially emotionally physically they can get themselves in all sorts of trouble

1062987 few journalists are capable of working a television camera and sound recorder while also taking notes and interviewing talent the obvious danger is that by trying to be all things and do all things at once a converged journalist finishes up not doing anything well
1062988 while it is likely that there will be some cross pollination between different media in the future it will be along the lines of television news rooms providing content for radio news or of newspaper journalists providing content for web sites the idea of journalism being all things to all media at once is a fallacy

1062999 while prices continue to fall in coastal and western markets prices appear to have stabilized in midwestern markets that were previously declining
1063000 the real test will come in the fall when markets typically experience a seasonal slowdown which will be exacerbated by high job losses and foreclosures

1063006 the economic and financial environment in the first half of the year deteriorated progressively
1063007 in the major developed economies where we operate economic growth slowed as asset prices particularly of residential property declined this in turn affected consumer confidence and hence spending in credit markets illiquidity remained a major issue with trading volumes low and no sign of resumption of normal activity levels in the securitisation markets

1063074 now people of all income levels are buying small cars to pinch pennies at the gas pump but they are not scrimping on creature comforts instead they are spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars on options like heated leather seats and high end entertainment systems usually found in luxury cars

1063076 but we figured if we buy something thats small and fun we can achieve some gas savings it just kills me personally when i take a ride by myself and im getting 10 miles to the gallon and i have nothing in the back

1063086 this initial rollout provides consumers increasingly convenient access to their favorite movies and is one more step in the fulfillment of our mission to transform blockbuster into a multi channel provider of media entertainment
1063087 this alliance with blockbuster is an exciting step for ncr as we pursue our mission of becoming the leader in the market for entertainment self service solutions

1063089 it was his firms policy to not provide clients with their files
1063090 longstanding practice and policy that files in his law office were his property
1063091 yes it is the official and formal policy in this law firm to contact the represented client on the other side of the case we do it every time and follow the policy meticulously opposing clients say the darnedest things often their attorneys call me and yell but this is ridiculous because i always inform them of our firm firm policy i even offer to send them our handbook which says so one time someone at the licensing board contacted me about all this but i told her about our policy so she wont be writing back we also call the newspaper and tell them things our clients have told us if they are juicy that is our policy

1063093 thanks to the companys conservative management philosophy that is supported by an experienced and conservative board of directors prudent steps were taken to address the areas soft real estate market actions included the addition of almost 2 4 million to the companys overall loan loss reserve through the first six months of 2008
1063094 our board and management recognize that real estate loan collateral values have been negatively impacted by the soft real estate market over the last few quarters although we cannot be certain as to the impact this will have on our loan portfolio we believe that losses related to real estate loans will probably increase throughout our markets conservative management of our loan portfolio is paramount in this environment larger loan loss reserves strengthen our ability to absorb losses should they occur
1063095 even with the downturn in real estate activity and the 2 4 million addition to the companys loan loss reserve peoples bancorporation reported a 50 000 profit for the first six months of 2008 in addition at the conclusion of business on june 30 2008 the company reported total assets of 555 1 million assets have grown by 34 6 million or 6 6 percent in the 12 month period with gross loans rising by 36 5 million to 423 2 million a 9 4 percent increase deposits grew by 2 5 million since june 30 2007 to 413 1 million an increase of 0 6 percent
1063096 in my 40 years in the financial industry im not sure i have ever seen this much economic turbulence however we believe peoples has positioned itself to weather the present situation until the market corrects itself as it inevitably will
1063097 as evidence of our seriousness about the safety and soundness of our company one of the additions to the peoples management team in the last few years was a well seasoned individual to head up the overall risk management function for peoples bancorporation
1063098 were taking precautions to keep peoples operating soundly as we look forward to better economic times

1063100 at the moment i can see some merit in this claim
1063101 the refugee status appeals authority has simply based its decision entirely on the inference that the shallow faith they say she has will erode
1063102 the inference that her faith would be eroded in future is not an inference open to the appeals authority
1063103 the finding of the first issue was flawed and when it came to the second issue it didnt consider it
1063104 they have treated that as decisive and failed to consider whether theres a real chance of persecution
1063105 the real chance of persecution was and is a mandatory consideration
1063106 my first experience of the sport was through my dad geoff
1063107 he used to take the family to the pool when i was young hes the reason im in this position
1063108 i was playing for queensland university id had three years there and loved it but always wanted to coach
1063109 dad called to say there was a fulltime coaching position coming up after the building of the glenfield leisure centre
1063110 i packed my bags left my job girlfriend and dog and was home in two days
1063111 at the time school teams from all over auckland used to come to glenfield for coaching
1063112 he was a big strong lad much bigger than me he collapsed in exactly the same spot as dad virtually the same chalk marks it was unbelievable
1063113 three generations were lost in four months it was a surreal time
1063114 ive wanted to be part of an olympic games since dad died
1063115 at first i thought i could be in deep trouble
1063116 then they told me id been selected to referee in beijing i did a couple of backflips
1063117 the goal is not to have just a referee at an olympics but a team as well
1063118 a geotechnical engineer looked at it on thursday and said it was uninhabitable and im not allowed back
1063119 i do need a house so anyone with a rental property please contact me im desperate
1063120 were expecting the first report within a week but the engineers can take a while depending on how much work needs to be done
1063121 they feel that in the wake of recent apparently targeted assaults and bag snatchings in the area the policy does not address their safety
1063122 my colleagues and i often leave after 9pm on thursdays and fridays and it gives me the creeps to walk out of the mall area to my car
1063123 we can deal with inconvenience but to put these women at risk as they walk to their cars is not acceptable especially if something can be done about it
1063124 i have made inquiries of council staff and the district plan does require certain numbers based on overall demand
1063125 it does not specify splits other than a clause that states that the owner or occupier of a site shall not unreasonably allocate or manage the parking spaces so as to prevent staff fleet vehicles visitors or particular occupiers associated with that site from utilising this parking
1063126 it doesnt mean they have to provide a space for every staff member but they should not disproportionately allocate the spaces they have between staff and customers
1063127 the use of this parking space is at the discretion of the retailers and their employees
1063128 cctv security and a close working relationship with the police and council authorities are measures to maintain this environment
1063129 this service has been in operation at the centre for some years now it extends to both the retailers parking and within the centres carpark areas
1063130 if just one person is reminded to get checked by seeing this bag and it saves a life then the goal of this program has been served

1063133 if you think mortuary tours are biblical please tell me the name of the apostle of the lord jesus who did it
1063134 we have a strong finnish tradition in the team and ive seen both mika and kimi take their first grand prix wins while driving for mclaren
1063135 with heikki yesterdays result was fully justified and very much deserved hes had his fair share of bad luck during the early part of the season and his win in hungary showed that hed let none of that misfortune pile up on his shoulders
1063136 and weve seen with all our other drivers that once they get that winning feeling its something they want to keep doing and none of us in the team are left in any doubt that heikki is a superb racing driver and this result will only strengthen his ambition in the second half of the year im fully confident that heikki will win another grand prix before the end of the season and we fully aim to provide him with the equipment to do so ferrari in the constructors championship and it will only be to our benefit to have both our drivers pushing as hard as possible to close down that points gap
1063137 clearly felipe was strong in budapest particularly in the early part of the race and we come away from hungary with a clear intention of understanding where that perceived uplift of performance came from
1063138 in our second stint i think we started to turn our fortunes around we pitted later than felipe fuelled lewis significantly longer than the ferrari and had a performance advantage despite the heavier fuel load we felt confident that we would have been in a significantly stronger position going into the last stint but unfortunately lewiss tyre problem not only forced him to complete the best part of a lap on a flat tyre he suffered the failure at turn one and the tyre was flat by turn two but also caused him to pit earlier than anticipated this not only negated the fuel advantage he was originally carrying but forced him to look after his super soft tyres over a far longer stint than we had originally anticipated that he managed to do that so effortlessly is a great testament to his presence of mind and his fifth position during an afternoon of damage limitation was a truly impressive result
1063139 the reality is that you cant isolate the advantages that a singular piece of aerodynamic componentry brings to the cars performance
1063140 its a testament not just to our design and windtunnel teams but also to our model making and manufacturing departments that we have been able to bring so many new items like these to recent races and our aggressive development strategy shows no sign of slowing down this is where the world championship will be won or lost weve seen it happen before
1063141 we are undertaking two 50km shakedown tests ahead of valencia were also continually developing new parts for the car as our simulation and development departments continue to produce new parts well take a view as to whether theyll be raced we wont disclose what they are but im sure youll see some new components appear during friday testing at the next race
1063142 we tested the engine cover dorsal fin during the pre german grand prix test at hockenheim its intended aim was to improve the cars sensitivity during yaw but we found that some of the advantage it brought to that area was being offset elsewhere as you can clearly see it is a large structure and one that is particularly sensitive to crosswinds we felt that our car already delivers sufficiently in yaw and that continuing to experiment with the dorsal fin might not bring us the sufficient performance benefit wed require to make it worthwhile as such it is not something we are giving priority to at the moment
1063143 weve been paying very close attention to the construction of the new shorefront circuit in valencia and are convinced it is going to be an exciting addition to the formula 1 calendar and an absolutely top line facility
1063144 de liberal it in such a way that it became a popular movement in city and in country how to make such an organization standing up for 4th amendment rights smell less ikea and more probass

1063154 it appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job his frustration over that and his stated hatred for the liberal movement
1063155 we have recovered a four page letter in which he describes his feelings
1063156 to our knowledge right now he is the lone suspect in this case
1063157 it appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job his frustration over that and his stated hatred for the liberal movement
1063158 we have recovered a four page letter in which he describes his feelings
1063159 it appears that church had received some publicity in the recent past regarding its liberal stance on things and that is at least one of the issues we believe caused that church to be selected
1063160 he indicated also in that letter that he expected to be in there shooting people until the police arrived and he fully expected to be killed by the responding police
1063161 he in his written statement does not describe any affiliation with anybody

1063184 its disturbing to see some of the ads in magazines or online that promote dhea as if it were a drug or anabolic steroid when the fact is existing research has not demonstrated that kind of effect advertising that overpromises results leads to consumer confusion and casts a negative shadow over the entire industry
1063185 research demonstrates that in young healthy adults supplemental dhea does not affect testosterone levels and does not provide performance enhancing benefits therefore it should not be marketed as having an anabolic steroid effect
1063186 even though research suggests that dhea when used as directed has a strong safety profile manufacturers should not be marketing this product to those under 18 years old as it does not appear to have benefits for that age group the benefits of dhea appear to be for older individuals who are experiencing the normal decline in hormone levels that come with age or in those people who have otherwise compromised hormone levels

1063233 the death of government scientist bruce ivins has generated far more questions about the anthrax attacks than it has answered i want to return to the role the establishment media played in obfuscating the anthrax investigation for so long and at times aiding in what was clearly the deliberate deceit on the part of government sources
1063234 abc news has some explaining to do the suicide of bruce ivins a government scientist whos now being described as the principal suspect in the anthrax attacks that followed 9 11 not that theres a whole lot of evidence has prompted renewed scrutiny of abcs sensational claim in october 2001 that the anthrax had been traced to saddam husseins regime in iraq
1063235 it now appears that the attacks were of domestic origin and the anthrax came from within u s government facilities this leads us to ask you who were the four well placed and separate sources who falsely told abc news that tests conducted at fort detrick showed bentonite in the anthrax sent to sen tom daschle causing abc news to connect the attacks to iraq in multiple reports over a five day period in october 2001

1063629 i have found my virtual book tour experience to be thought provoking and illuminating it has made me think my book and my writing in much more thoughtful manner i truly believe that virtual book tours help writers and inform readers and i know that i will be doing one for all of my future novels
1063630 the tour was 10 times harder than writing the book would i do it again sure it was challenging but it was fun

1063632 i giornalisti che ancora danno dignit a questo paese con la loro voce vanno protetti dagli sciaccalli di regime dai killer della parola
1063633 aver aperto una campagna critica contro anno zero e contro lo stesso travaglio
1063634 avendo abdicato tutti i suoi poteri ad organi sovranazionali come la bce la commissione europea il wto la banca mondiale
1063635 se calipari fosse morto nelle stesse identiche circostanze ma per salvare agliana quattrocchi o cupertino voi cosa avreste scritto di lui avreste celebrato la morte di un eroe o avreste scritto di uno sbirro al servizio sciagurato dei contractors imperialisti

1063653 ho scritto quanto segue nel blog di grillo non ne ho trovato traccia mp
1063654 avevo gi segnalato il tuo caso sul sito di beppe grillo una delle due segnalazioni che ho inviato quella nel commento pi votato stata bannata la gabanelli anche l evidentemente non si tocca ma tu resisti non sei solo
1063655 non ho tempo da perdere dietro ai delirii di uno squinternato che mi diffama su internet con processi alle intenzioni le mie considerazioni su fama potere e libert

1063657 sulla testa di ogni giornalista pende oggi la spada di damocle di una querela per diffamazione lui e il suo giornale rischia la bancarotta chi querela assolutamente niente anche se la denuncia si rivela infondata infatti quasi impossibile ottenere un risarcimento risultato i giornalisti scrivono sempre di meno e sempre pi politically correct le querele per diffamazione non si contano e i danni morali liquidati raggiungono cifre sbalorditive con buona pace del pluralismo e della libert di stampa
1063658 con buona pace del pluralismo e della libert di stampa
1063659 e grave capitato anche a me un editore mi ha lasciato solo in tribunale a sorbirmi tutte le grane di ci che mi aveva pubblicato
1063660 ma sai io sono amico della gabanelli e prima di attaccare unamica dovrei vedere meglio
1063661 ma sai io sono amico della gabanelli e prima di attaccare unamica
1063662 caro barnard vorrei capire meglio la vicenda che la riguarda vorrei farle unintervista magari video ma non necessariamente da far girare on line a partire dal mio blog un cordiale saluto piero ricca
1063663 minteressa anche il tuo punto di vista su leadership e responsabilit individuale nel campo della societ civile progressista o antagonista
1063664 confido in video intervista sugli sviluppi e il significato del caso non appena possibile per entrambi
1063665 caro paolo barnard dato che sto lavorando a un film documentario sullinformazione vorrei intervistarti e raccogliere la tua testimonianza sperando che la parola non ti ricordi troppo i tribunali
1063666 caro paolo grazie della risposta ho letto il tuo articolo e non mi passata la voglia di intervistarti ti chiamer un giorno di questi per prendere un appuntamento
1063667 su grillo mi sono arrivate voci che sul blog ci sia censura mi pare che la voce si stia spargendo daltra parte pure una sua scelta parlare di quello che vuole
1063668 no scusa ma hai preso un granchio non si tratta del suo diritto di postare ci che lui vuole qui parliamo dei cittadini i cui contributi lui non deve filtrare se non in casi di palesi volgarit o illegalit i post dei cittadini sul suo blog sono liberi e lo sono sempre stati lui cancella quelli scomodi li censura
1063669 mi sembra che il senso della tua battaglia debba essere protezione legale da parte degli editori per i giornalisti che si espongono pi che una guerra contro la gabanelli
1063670 il senso della battaglia sia contro gli editori che ci abbandonano sia contro chiunque censuri se mi permetti gabanelli sta censurando a man bassa e partecipa a censura legale cosa devo fare il solito compagno di merende alla aldo grasso o grillo che con la censura di mimun sbraitano furibondi ma con la loro amica no fammi capire sabina la censura puzza di meno se la fa una amica tua o mia dimmi come ti posizioni tu perch qui veramente si fa fatica a capire la guerra la si fa contro chiunque censuri e se si chiama gabanelli chissenefrega o sbaglio
1063671 sabina quando si diventa star non si pi liberi perch la fama d potere e il potere diventa prioritario rispetto alla libert rileggi i nomi che ho citato ivan illich noam chomsky howard zinn john pilger rachel corrie giovanni ruggeri giorgio ambrosoli corrado staiano ilaria alpi peppino impastato nda quelli non furono e non saranno mai in prima serata tv va fatto altro e lho scritto e credo che tu labbia letto
1063672 caro paolo condivido la battaglia perch i giornalisti siano protetti legalmente dalle testate per cui lavorano non condivido la battaglia anti gabanelli non condivido la battaglia anti travaglio di cui ho stima
1063673 francamente mi sembra unanalisi che nasconde frustrazione e rivalsa mal indirizzate
1063674 d a barnard che faremo il v2 day anche per lui
1063675 il nostro compito principale di monitorare le fonti del potere
1063676 it is a very strange looking rock i touched it i felt it and i just dont see how it could have been produced
1063677 thats when i noticed the partially exposed rock on the side of a sand pit but i didnt pick it up at first because i thought there were deer up ahead and didnt want to break off the pursuit
1063678 in july 2007 i was introduced to ufo investigators chuck zukowski and debbie ziegelmeyer and they were astounded at what they saw
1063679 all of whom claimed they had never seen anything like it
1063680 they said there is no way this rock could have been scored or drilled in the way it was without sophisticated modern equipment like lasers and high speed water fed grinders and drills
1063681 it retains its magnetic polarity by which it will spin a compass needle and register its magnetic field on meters
1063682 after i had it a few months i began to think about it and began to think that it may be a beacon of some kind or a message
1063683 and i believe the message is that if we dont learn to get along with each other we will be destroyed
1063684 gosh i dont know im not all that good at writing dialogue i always end up using words no one would ever use in real life like
1063685 even better if youre looking to challenge yourself and stretch your writing muscles is the project for you who knows you might even discover a hidden talent for dialogue
1063686 im still not so sure about this can a story really be written using nothing but dialogue
1063687 why dont you see for yourself visit and read a few of the existing submissions be sure to leave some feedback about what works and what doesnt when youre done try your hand at writing your own
1063688 little old me write my very own pure dialogue is addictive just like those chocolate covered espresso beans you eat for breakfast every morning
1063689 use magnetic poetry tiles to compose a haiku ode or sonnet go freestyle or pentameter just write restricted to the words on the tiles
1063690 quaquaversal means literally turned wheresoever this project thrives off of dynamism if it doesnt spread and expand and gather and propagate new ideas and images then it simply cannot be quaquaversal
1063691 i enjoy trying to put as much meaning into six words as possible i feel like months and days have a lot of feelings attached to them july feels different from october just as monday feels different from saturday
1063692 poems about nature mostly but also about the night and things we want and the things we dont
1063693 the ancient tale of jack and the beanstalk but with more mystery magic and mayhem than ever before
1063694 just the lowest craziest darkest moments of their lives with or without a diagnosis
1063695 i didnt expect anyone to read it i just wrote a short 5 page story about myself and put it up i didnt know that so many people had similar experiences i think that mental illness is perhaps more common among writers and thinkers than among the general population if thats so then it is no wonder that writers have such a drive to create it helps balance out the forces that overwhelm us sometimes
1063696 it was only after taking an open university course in creative writing that i felt confident in pursuing my passion for fiction and life writing
1063697 we have to stop rallies and marches or anything that leads to mass gatherings
1063698 eu foreign policy chief javier solana and 5 1 countries representatives should heed the issues agreed upon in tehran talks and to remain faithful to them
1063699 there was no mention about a particular time in tehran and we told mr solana that we would survey the matter in a months time and present our proposal these are the points over which we reached agreement in tehran and the 5 1 countries have to respect them
1063700 the literature of appointing deadlines is incomprehensible for us and we too presented our viewpoints within the span of the one months time that we had agreed upon so it is now their turn to declare their stands regarding the response they have got from us
1063701 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to meet the challenges we face or isnt giving the american people straight talk
1063702 we have to make a serious nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away
1063703 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power
1063704 the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea two months ago is a slide in his poll numbers
1063705 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1063706 im not going to get into whos right whos wrong im completely wrong
1063707 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1063708 were still waiting on the doctors to give us the timetable on when were going to have this procedure done
1063709 i will not put myself into a position where i have to defend myself to state my side of the story theres no side
1063710 theres only one side a lack of judgment on my part thats really all i have to say i have no excuse all i have is the opportunity to gain the respect of my fans to gain the respect of my family gain the respect of my co workers and gain the respect of the organization
1063711 im a fallen man im a man that made a mistake
1063712 i plan to mend the bridges that ive burned and help rebuild the bridge if i need to all by myself
1063713 the good thing is that we were both man enough to come face to face and talk without any other kind of altercations
1063714 were bigger than that sometimes when emotions are involved you do stupid things for me being a christian i have a forgiving heart and im willing to move forward to help this team win this year
1063715 we still have some more things to talk about as far as what can we do to be able to go out there and coexist on the same field same team and be productive and help this team win this year
1063716 only two men can do that and feel like we have what it takes in order to do so
1063717 arroyo is a player of the highest standard and has been our top priority for a while
1063718 its absolutely brutal theres nothing you can do you just put your head down and keep playing
1063719 what happens in a situation like that is youre going to have a divided locker room
1063720 its hard it was hard for me when montana left and went to kansas city because you get so comfortable with your no 1 guy and we know that this guy has won super bowls and is a future hall of famer youre going to have some guys in bretts corner and you might have some guys who are tired of this and want to move on and side with aaron if that team doesnt come out strong and they start losing games with aaron rodgers youre going to have a lot of people questioning why brett isnt starting
1063721 i wanted to play everyone wants to play so brett retiring and then coming back i blame no one for that but it is a bizarre situation for such a marquee player to be put in that situation the teams obviously started to move forward without him and now it just becomes awkward for someone who represents the packers and the packers represent him in so many ways i hope they work it out so there is a good kumbaya feeling at the end
1063722 i think what happens is as you get older and youve been around for a long time you can sense the organization trying to slide you out a little bit
1063723 brett probably felt that pressure and at first he wanted to accommodate them by saying he was going to move on and walk away from the game but afterwards im sure he said to himself i still want to play again i think i should be able to play with the green bay packers but if they dont want me then why not let me go to minnesota or chicago im sure theyd want to get him out of the division but i think he has the right to make his own calls
1063724 ive talked to aaron the packers have called me and he and i have traded messages
1063725 i actually meant to call him last week and congratulate him and let him know how well hes handling himself its not an easy spot to be in
1063726 every meal they keep lecturing us about healthy foods fruit and grains and all that stuff and then we come out here and have to smell that oh man pure torture
1063727 im not going to get into whos right whos wrong im completely wrong
1063728 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1063729 were still waiting on the doctors to give us the timetable on when were going to have this procedure done
1063730 i will not put myself into a position where i have to defend myself to state my side of the story theres no side
1063731 theres only one side a lack of judgment on my part thats really all i have to say i have no excuse all i have is the opportunity to gain the respect of my fans to gain the respect of my family gain the respect of my co workers and gain the respect of the organization

1063741 right now im working on fixing my head position in freestyle its too high even after 11 years ive never swum it right
1063742 thats one of the most impressive things ive ever seen him do
1063743 sweet girl that was sure a big smile on your face
1063744 i was just remembering when we registered for these and we got four with the thought that we would have two itty bittys to eat ice cream sundaes with us and now we do and that makes me happy
1063745 yeah and we cant wait to ship them off to grandma and grandpas so we can get something done and not go insane and we are both trying not to eat ice cream is that what we expected
1063746 something like this ive enjoyed so much being with the guys
1063747 just seeing everybody and mixing with everybody brought back such great memories
1063748 but it wasnt hard when i look back it was a lot of fun
1063749 one thing ive learned about mr eddie is that not only does he talk the talk he walks the walk i hope to one day see him in this position of the enshrinees he may be a little short in size but believe me he is as big as all of this
1063750 not right now like brett favre ill never rule anything out
1063751 but ill reiterate that ive always loved eddie hes a great friend of mine i wouldnt close the door
1063752 you want them to have an appreciation and learn the history of the game
1063753 there were a lot of players who played the game before them whats been built so far was built on a lot of other peoples legacies what kind of legacies are they going to leave
1063754 michael said i wish id known some of the things about the game now that i learned being involved with the hall of fame
1063755 every pound per square inch of tire underinflation wastes 4 million gallons of gas daily in the u s
1063756 she said the sport including archery from the saddle sword games and throwing spears was not as dangerous as it might look but the key to mastering skill at arms said ms jones is the mount

1063759 if we unite and ask the public to choose our leader and knesset representation
1063760 we will definitely increase our strength but if we remain as is four parties running as one we are likely to decrease in size
1063761 one united party not just a technical list for the purpose of knesset elections is likely to be the result
1063762 another historic first the mks have apparently agreed to allow their future to be determined by a council of public figures rabbis settlement leaders and others the council will choose the knesset list and there will apparently be no guaranteed slots for the incumbents knesset members at least not in the top ten this is unprecedented in knesset history
1063763 as someone who has worked in the knesset for a number of years i can tell you that there is no other knesset faction in which the mks work so harmoniously and help each other in no other party is there anything like this even the two mks who were at very strong odds with each other a while ago now work together it is important to remember that even though sometimes the national religious press likes to present an opposite picture
1063764 and our solution to this end is to hold nation wide primaries to choose the leader of our united list enable practical involvement of wider circles in the national religious and secular public and allow the public a say in choosing the knesset list
1063765 this is a good plan and the only way to bring about unity of the four parties
1063766 i hope the other parties will accept it the current situation of four parties is abnormal we need a leader and one party that will lead our moves i have hope that this can be done time is running out we cant know when elections will be held and we have to make the decisions as quickly as possible
1063767 what will the idf do when we go out to the lines and what will the state do in order to return a hostage alive or dead
1063768 gilad shalit has been held hostage for more than two years and we must return him and make every effort on this matter we know that gilad shalit is alive where he is being held and by whom
1063769 but we completed the mission in the north and returned eldad regev and ehud goldwasser unfortunately not alive but we returned them to a jewish grave i cant go into details but efforts are being exerted on the gilad shalit issue on all levels
1063770 must always remember that if anything happens to them we will make sure they are returned to their families
1063771 what the chief of staff meant to say was that we know gilad shalit is being held by hamas in the gaza strip his remark offers no new information
1063772 hamas has put an end to fatahs job in gaza
1063773 and is now waiting patiently for the next stage mainly its takeover of judea and samaria hamas plans this to occur after the completion of the gilad shalit deal in which its central activists and arrested parliament members are to be freed
1063774 when abu mazen mahmoud abbas completes his term of office as pa president sometime in 2009 ed the position is to go automatically to the parliament head who is a hamas member
1063775 under the circumstances the chances are slim that there will be general elections and practically the question of elections will be decided totally by hamas which will only agree to elections that it will win
1063776 hamas won decisively in the last elections for municipal leaders defeating imprisoned for murder fatah leader marwan barghoutis men and also winning in the second round of legislative council elections
1063777 israeli policy is attempting to connect judea samaria with gaza via the safe passage through the kiryat gat tarkumiye route north of hevron ed under a joint fatah hamas or neutral technocratic government however this does not jibe with what is going on in the field and could worsen the situation for israel and even endanger the stability of jordan connecting gaza with judea samaria will make it easier for hamas to spread out into the latter and this will endanger neighboring jordan a hamas man said hamam already heads the muslim brotherhood in jordan
1063778 as we saw in gush katif the uprooting of the jewish towns there was the first step leading towards the hamas takeover in gaza and even endangered egypt as egyptian president hosni mubarak admitted when he called the disengagement a honey trap a similar process in judea and samaria will endanger the state of israel the palestinians and jordan
1063779 there are leading members in kadima and labor who have close ties with fatah and who are liable to weave plans for the idf to conquer gaza in order to return it to fatah rule we must be very careful not to do this whether or not the idf intervenes in gaza must be decided only based on considerations of israeli security and not on interference in the internal palestinian maze the end of which we cannot know
1063780 this year we witnessed how our kidnapped soldiers for whom the war broke out came back in coffins this brings up many questions regarding the purpose of the war what were its accomplishments
1063781 i hope that yesterdays statement is the beginning of the end of he who should have taken responsibility two years ago and not wait till today when he resigns because of money issues he should have resigned because of the blood not because of the money
1063782 thus said hashem whoever remains in this city will die by the sword by the famine or by the pestilence whereas whoever goes out in surrender to the chaldeans will live he will have his life as a booty and he will live
1063783 thus said hashem this city will surely be delivered into the hand of the army of the king of babylonia and he will capture it
1063784 let this man be put to death now because he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who remain in this city and the hands of all the people by speaking to them such things for this man does not seek the welfare of this people but rather their detriment

1063792 is israels lifeblood no one understands this better than israels enemies that is precisely why they still engage in a systematic campaign to erase the historical link of the jews to this great city for if israel were severed from jerusalem the jewish state would lose its sense of legitimacy and its will to fight only then could israel be destroyed

1063800 at the risk of condoning the self perpetuating hyperbole that permeates the cultural significance of the 1960s at the heart of the emergence of the psychedelic pop movement was a realisation sparked by some of stanley owsleys highest quality pharmaceutical products that within the superficial simplicity of the humble pop song resided infinite layers crying out for artistic exploration that contradiction or maybe its just a dialectic remains central to the lovetones music on the last lovetones record meditations the band explored more obvious psychedelic territory wading through fuzzed out soundscapes that threatened to bend your mind into a rubbery mass there are a couple of noticeable deviations on axiom firstly the lovetones detour away from their previous journey to the depths of psychedelic pop in favour of a sonic landscape that explores the beauty of the pop form that exists within the modern psychedelic style secondly theres a multi instrumental aspect perhaps best illustrated by the poly dimensional navigator that embellishes the pop sensibility without saturating it throughout it all matthew tow remains a master of the pop song the first single lifted from the album wintertime in hollywood is proof positive a love song that makes you smile without puking with a melody that hangs around without overstaying its welcome or theres the sweet and sunny californian happiness of say you will a perfect recipe for a day at the beach free from the brain frying frustrations of everyday life and just to show that theres still some psychedelic exploration left in the lovetones alone rounds out the album with some blurry eyed string augmented artistic indulgence the lovetones are criminally under appreciated in australia for once you can be sure the americans are smarter than us on this one axiom is unlikely to redress completely that criminality but it should help

1063901 abuse or unfounded fear either way talks to delve into ritual child torture
1063902 in a survey of more than 11 000 psychiatric and police workers throughout the country conducted for the national center on child abuse and neglect researchers found more than 12 000 accusations of group cult sexual abuse based on satanic ritual but not one that investigators had been able to substantiate
1063903 one respondent cited as evidence the ritual abuse behavior checklist a dubious diagnostic checklist which includes many behaviors common to childhood gould 1986
1063904 our research leads us to believe that there are many more children being abused in the name of god than in the name of satan
1063905 our survey revealed that there was essentially no hard evidence of organized child abusing satanic cults that had infiltrated preschools or the fbi or that had kidnapped or slain babies in contrast there was much indirect evidence of clinical induction of false memories and plentiful evidence of religion related abuse including sexual abuse by catholic priests although much of my research indicates that children can have largely accurate memories and can resist strong suggestions they can in contrast as indicated by the dramatic examples of ritual abuse claims also tell wild tales cave in to misleading questions and make important errors the same is true of some adults of course all of the books about personal cases of sra were written by adults who seem to have believed their own stories

1063914 okay right doomas youre going to be the second tank
1063915 yeah but youre a paladin you have platemail you have a shield you can tank him

1063927 well i missed my roll but i really need to hit this guy this round so ill burn an ap and try again
1063928 in addition without a limit on the number of aps you can spend in an encounter other than your max surges you still have the issue of someone burning all their surges immediately in an encounter and taking two actions a round for the next 5 rounds

1063937 for the first time in the history of our nation we come upon a development that we are unfamiliar with and that we cannot remember whereby the ruling party in our midst will come and offer up jerusalem even to the worst of our enemies
1063938 this is not only a political failure but it also jeopardizes our security it is a fundamental moral failure in the national jewish and religious sense
1063939 in the context of the matters we are dealing with the shin bets position is that the term subversive can include attempts to change the fundamental values of the state by nullifying its democratic or jewish character and can be regarded as undermining the arrangements of the democratic regime and its institutions
1063940 netanyahu knows full well that the subject of jerusalem was not discussed with the palestinians therefore nobody decided on dividing jerusalem and no steps in this direction have been taken
1063941 the palestinians are divided between fatah and hamas and so its difficult for either side to make the bold move needed
1063942 away whatever excuses they may have and whatever rationales may exist in the international community for not ratcheting up sanctions and taking serious action
1063943 my goal is to avoid being confronted with that hypothetical

1063986 of course im a christian i go to church dont i
1063987 but what difference does it make how we define a christian anyway why make christ such a big part of it dont all roads basically lead
1063988 most assuredly i say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
1063989 saved us not because of the good things we did but because of his mercy he washed away our sins and gave us a new life through the holy spirit

1063997 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help him would you try
1063998 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
1063999 he doesnt does he my brother was a christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to jesus to heal him how is this jesus good hmmm can you answer that one
1064000 thats right god made satan didnt he tell me son is there evil in this world
1064001 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
1064002 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
1064003 is there sickness immorality hatred ugliness all these terrible things do they exist in this world
1064004 who created them there is still no answer suddenly the lecturer breaks
1064005 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen jesus
1064006 have you ever actually felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelt your jesus have you ever had any sensory perception of jesus christ or god for that matter
1064007 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son
1064008 and that is the problem science has with god there is no evidence only faith
1064009 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat unlimited heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold we can hit up to 458 degrees below zero which is no heat but we cant go any further after that there is no such thing as cold otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest 458 degrees every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 458 f is the total absence of heat you see sir cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat we cannot measure cold heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy cold is not the opposite of heat sir just the absence of it
1064010 what about darkness professor is there such a thing as darkness
1064011 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
1064012 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
1064013 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
1064014 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
1064015 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
1064016 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
1064017 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavour are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a preacher
1064018 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
1064019 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
1064020 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelled the professors brain no one appears to have done so so according to the established rules of empirical stable demonstrable protocol science says that you have no brain with all due respect sir so if science says you have no brain how can we trust your lectures sir
1064021 now you accept that there is faith and in fact faith exists with life
1064022 of course there is we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
1064023 evil does not exist sir or at least it does not exist unto itself evil is simply the absence of god it is just like darkness and cold a word that man has created to describe the absence of god god did not create evil evil is the result of what happens when man does not have gods love present in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light

1064025 sen obama has looked at this issue he recognizes that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we need to look at this strategically and he made the decision that we need to tap the strategic petroleum reserves
1064026 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency

1064060 what happens in a situation like that is youre going to have a divided locker room
1064061 its hard it was hard for me when montana left and went to kansas city because you get so comfortable with your no 1 guy and we know that this guy has won super bowls and is a future hall of famer youre going to have some guys in bretts corner and you might have some guys who are tired of this and want to move on and side with aaron if that team doesnt come out strong and they start losing games with aaron rodgers youre going to have a lot of people questioning why brett isnt starting
1064062 i wanted to play everyone wants to play so brett retiring and then coming back i blame no one for that but it is a bizarre situation for such a marquee player to be put in that situation the teams obviously started to move forward without him and now it just becomes awkward for someone who represents the packers and the packers represent him in so many ways i hope they work it out so there is a good kumbaya feeling at the end
1064063 i think what happens is as you get older and youve been around for a long time you can sense the organization trying to slide you out a little bit
1064064 brett probably felt that pressure and at first he wanted to accommodate them by saying he was going to move on and walk away from the game but afterwards im sure he said to himself i still want to play again i think i should be able to play with the green bay packers but if they dont want me then why not let me go to minnesota or chicago im sure theyd want to get him out of the division but i think he has the right to make his own calls
1064065 ive talked to aaron the packers have called me and he and i have traded messages
1064066 i actually meant to call him last week and congratulate him and let him know how well hes handling himself its not an easy spot to be in

1064080 this last rally was particularly telling as the financials rallied violently in the face of jpmorgan chase amp co s warning about a deteriorating prime mortgage book
1064081 in our view the only absolute evidence that investors should focus on to support the belief that the worst is over is price stability in the u s housing market

1064088 my thoughts on the matter start with caseys last comment which is spot on though not always followed by smart opinionated indie booksellers
1064089 it is vital that booksellers do not judge people for their reading tastes whether its ann coulter or dan brown or michael moore our job is to match books with readers part of that we do by recommending books we love to people who might share our tastes but part of that is also an exercise in empathy with people who do not share our views and tastes getting inside their heads to give them the book that is going to satisfy them
1064090 pointed out that since most of us want to be booksellers because its fun for us we want to be able to stock the books we like but we also need to stock books that sell so the smart thing is to open your store in a neighborhood where people are likely to share your tastes that way you can stock and recommend your loved books to a customer base thats open to them even needs them i suspect for many booksellers that means running a fairly liberal bookstore in a fairly liberal area this makes the question easier as good business sense and our own opinions coincide
1064091 people look to bookstores to fill all kinds of needs theres a place for a niche progressive store where the customers know exactly what theyre going to find when they enter and know that if they need resources for their particular point of view theres a store thats likely to have them theres also a place for bookstores that provide for a wide variety of customers thats the beauty of independent stores
1064092 for over 32 years old harbor books has taken strong stands on political issues
1064093 i cant imagine not taking positions in our community i cant imagine how i would feel about myself if we didnt take positions on important issues i also think in the long run our bookstore has profited from taking stands most people i think on both sides respect us for taking stands and we have gotten thousands and thousands of dollars of free advertising
1064094 we dont wear our political heart on our sleeve we dont hang posters in support of candidates national or local we dont take public stands as a store on politically hot topics except the importance of shopping locally and the need for amazon to play fair and charge sales tax as a private citizen and business owner i have the same right as everyone else to say what i feel
1064095 although we have gradually reduced our liabilities we never seem to be able to save for unexpected events our line of credit hovers near the 30 000 mark and our credit card debt jumped up to almost 14 000 with the expense of a new furnace and a new computer i try to keep the balance to a manageable level but it is not working
1064096 they are both retired so there will not be any increase in income except for old age security that phyllis will receive in four years at age 65
1064097 they have only transitory savings of a few hundred dollars a month that they spend fairly soon therefore we have to look closely at their spending in order to find ways to help them reduce their debt
1064098 phyllis and herb have a reasonable income for a good retirement
1064099 their mistake was to go into retirement with outstanding debts if they tighten their belts for a couple of years they should be able to enjoy their retirement comfortably

1064115 democracy is a messy thing especially when you have an electorate that exceeds 600 million people who are motivated to vote however democracy also helps to ensure that individual liberties are respected and that the government is responsive and beholden to the will of the people rich or poor a democracy also ensures accountability through impartial courts that help enforce and protect such things as property rights environmental rights human rights and good governance

1064119 there may not be another genentech for a long time any company with the potential will be snatched before it has a chance this may not be healthy for the larger pharma industry which not only needs more novel drugs but it also desperately needs new business strategies and new cultures that are able to keep the innovations coming even in a huge company

1064149 not surprisingly there is a similar phenomenon with our misperception of the way we spend our time there are a gazillion books and systems that tell you how best to allocate your time increase productivity yadda yadda yadda problem is most dont work because until now theres never really been a highly accurate way to automatically measure exactly what were doing and not doing all day long especially as we dance mercilessly between windows and applications on our computers and if you cant easily measure it no matter how much you know about what you should be doing youll never change because you dont have a realistic picture of what you are doing put another way you need to know where you starting in order to plot where you want to go

1064303 we have to make a serious nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away
1064304 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power
1064305 the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea two months ago is a slide in his poll numbers

1064309 its insistence on protecting its own industrial development is driving other countries to do the same and has been a major factor in the growing anti globalization and protectionist sentiment around the world
1064310 chinas foreign investment regulations are opaque and increasingly restrictive and the government continues to grant major subsidies to key domestic industrial sectors
1064311 heavy lobbying by local authorities and by profitable and powerful chinese businesses is shaping beijings industrial policy
1064312 in a way that has led to a significant appreciation of the yuan and forestalled dangerous protectionist legislation
1064313 currency appreciation and greater flexibility in chinas exchange rate could limit the impact of rising world oil and commodity prices on prices in china and at the same time allow chinese monetary policy to be a more effective tool for ensuring stable growth

1064341 if only i could so live and so serve the world that after me there should never again be birds in cages
1064342 each time a man stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million different centres of energy and daring those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance
1064343 remember that there is a meaning beyond absurdity be sure that every little deed counts that every word has power never forget that you can still do your share to redeem the world in spite of all absurdities and frustrations and disappointments
1064344 every good and excellent thing in the world stands moment by moment on the razor edge of danger and must be fought for whether its a field or a home or a country
1064345 how wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world
1064346 nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little
1064347 would he still be alive if i didnt write about him
1064348 the one thing we dont want is for kevin to change he averages 50 plus in test and one day cricket and he is an unbelievable talent
1064349 everyone will ask will his batting be affected but knowing kevin he will probably average 70 as captain
1064350 you know what he is like as soon as he is put under the pump and people start saying things about him he comes back and gets a big score i would imagine he will do that this time
1064351 the first innings against south africa in the first test at lords earlier this summer was the one for me a lot was said going into that series and the finger has been pointed at him by a lot of people
1064352 he is a bit nervous at first but gets his head down and blazes a hundred that is a measure of the man
1064353 when you see things like that i am sure he will take to captaincy in the same way he will take it in his stride
1064354 it is not just about being on the field moving the field about and changing the bowlers around
1064355 the thing is trying to leave it on the cricket field there is a lot off the field as well and i took it home with me from time to time that is what i found a bit hard about the job
1064356 michael said it affected him at home and he took the work home it is hard not to it is a hard job but it can be very rewarding as well if you get the results
1064357 you also need help from the rest of the side you also need a few people to lean on when i was doing the captaincy i took too much on myself and didnt have too many sounding boards or people to speak to about the job
1064358 kevin will be fine he is confident single minded and will have a definite approach to how he is going to do it the team have got to perform as well and there is no reason why we cant all be successful together
1064359 if you see when michael took over it was in similar circumstances to kevin now against south africa
1064360 michael quickly stamped his authority on things and the overriding thing was he wanted people to express themselves and enjoy playing cricket
1064361 that is how the england side played through his reign and we were successful michael helped me as a cricketer and tried to take away the fear of failure and let the players go out there and play
1064362 it is inevitable i suppose when a captain resigns or goes it is under poor circumstances i think vaughany deserved more than the circumstances he is going in now
1064363 it would have been nice to go after a series win or go out on a high which i think he definitely deserves and i just hope we havent seen the last of him
1064364 its a good idea unifying two formats of the game under one leader the continuity will be there
1064365 because of his performances he is one the players will respect
1064366 hes the logical choice and hes an exciting choice as well its an exciting time for england
1064367 its a bigger job than just captaining the england cricket team
1064368 effectively you are leading english cricket and the english game
1064369 hopefully the responsibility will dawn on kevin and his performances will improve as well
1064370 theyve been pretty good so far and if they improve that should be good for english cricket
1064371 his number one job with england is not the captaincy its scoring runs with england
1064372 in the past they have gone for tried and tested citizens
1064373 look this box has ones for heavy medium and low flow all in one
1064374 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him

1064400 remember dont you remember sister carolyn was teaching us about galileo so we were all obsessed with dropping stuff from high places to see what would land first like now and laters and then pink softies and baseball cards so we were all gonna meet after dinner at seven oclock or whatever on top of mikeys garage not crazy mikey mikey with the purple huffy and the mother that made us those little tiny grilled cheese sandwiches on cocktail bread and you know how you had to be there at seven you just had to it was the most important thing and running out of the house trying to get your mark 5 sneakers on and flying down tenth avenue so you wouldnt miss anything because god forbid you missed even a second and remember we were all up there on top of the garage and linda federesi had a mad crush on joey devito so she would always run home after she saw him so she could put on the same t shirt he was wearing so they would look alike so while everybody was sitting on the roof waiting for linda to get back with her corvettes rule t shirt crazy mikey got his foot caught in the gutter trying to kick out leaves and all the rubber deans and margaret tried to help him but the two of them fell and we all ran like idiots until linda federesi comes running back up the driveway screaming margaret landed first margaret landed first so we all ran back and for like the next two weeks we spent all our time finding places for crazy mike and margaret to jump from at the same time to see who would land first until margaret broke her arm and then oh my god we were all in so much fucking trouble oh and remember joey actually telling sister carolyn that we were conducting gravity experiments and margarets arm was broken in the name of science i will never forget that look on her face while she called us all hooligans and we were all sitting there in our little catholic school uniforms at our little desks and we all started quietly singing at the same time im a hooligan wont go to school again no no no by kiss remember dont you remember

1064423 we are hoping in the next three days the sky will be blue and the air quality will be there
1064424 you try not to get out in the sun too much so you dont get tired from sweating all day
1064425 every athlete that we have talked to is very impressed and amazed by the quality of this village
1064426 personally i have never seen such a nice village in nine games
1064427 after being here a week you get the same kind of things
1064428 they were taking every question seriously and making sure they will solve every problem
1064429 of course we will have a couple of problems along the way

1064503 dat fortis tweedekwartaalcijfers hoger blijken dan verwacht is onder meer te danken aan de betere prestatie van de verzekeringstak

1064505 een lagere koers dan de boekwaarde is beslist geen gegronde reden om een aandeel te kopen
1064506 helaas hebben europese banken veel meer boekhoudkundige ruimte om vanalles te verdraaien op korte termijn tenminste europese banken hebben daar de voorbije kwartalen ook dankbaar gebruik van gemaakt daar waar hun amerikaanse collegas een veel realistischer beeld v d feiten gerapporteerd hebben ik stel echter vast dat deze keer de markt op haar hoede is en zich niet laat beetnemen

1064511 la batalla electoral del 23 de noviembre es entre dos modelos el capitalismo y el socialismo as lo expres en nota de prensa y circular enviada a toda la militancia de ese colectivo en las regiones sindicatos y federaciones nacionales as como a la clase trabajadora en general
1064512 es estrat gico que los trabajadores nos inscribamos masivamente en el registro electoral del cne porque el 23 de noviembre no estaremos eligiendo alcaldes o gobernadores sino garantizando la profundizaci n hacia el modelo socialista
1064513 es por eso que desde la perspectiva de clase con mayor fuerza debemos participar en esta campa a como la consolidaci n del programa al socialismo y como generadora de la conciencia necesaria de profundizar el camino hacia el socialismo
1064514 por eso invitamos a los trabajadores no s lo a inscribirse en el registro electoral sino a participar en los diferentes eventos donde estaremos presentando desde el psuv a los candidatos nuestras propuestas para el programa de gobierno hacia el socialismo y a transformar esta campa a en una gesta movilizadora casa por casa calle por calle centro por centro de trabajo a discutir a construir conciencia y votar masivamente por la liberaci n y el socialismo

1064519 nuestros hermanos venezolanos nos brindan toda la colaboraci n y de verdad es un milagro que tantas personas recuperen su mirada su visi n
1064520 es como haber andado con una joroba ahora me siento renovado es como haber nacido de nuevo
1064521 yo me uno al noble gesto del gobierno venezolano a la solidaridad de sus principios esto hace que llevemos el mensaje de esperanza para los pueblos que est n oprimidos pienso que es un paso gigantesco el cual llevar en mi mente y mi coraz n
1064522 one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1064523 healthy and vibrant beaches are essential to our tourism industry which helps drive the states economy
1064524 diverting money from the shore protection fund places one of our most valuable resources at tremendous risk
1064525 the shore protection fund plays a vital role in protecting homes and businesses from the effects of coastal storms
1064526 without proper funding for shore protection projects atlantic storms could inflict even more damage on our already vulnerable coast
1064527 the shore protection fund is not a piggy bank to break open when the state is short on cash
1064528 we need to take steps to ensure that future administrations are prevented from raiding the shore protection fund to fill budget gaps
1064529 funding for shore protection projects is a valuable investment in one of our states most valuable resources
1064530 diverting money from the shore protection fund is a short sighted and irresponsible policy that unnecessarily puts our coast at risk
1064531 i believe it is the publics right to know what happens on the machines they buy a public servant should always be mindful that the taxpayers are the boss and it is to them they are accountable
1064532 there can be excuses for not doing what is right which is what this township committee is giving the public but that can never live up to being as good as just doing the right thing
1064533 and whatever things you ask in prayer believing you will receive
1064534 may he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed
1064535 you have granted him the desire of his heart and have not withheld the request of his lips
1064536 delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart
1064537 in bitterness of soul hannah wept much and prayed to the lord to give her a son
1064538 did what was right in the eyes of the lord just as his father david had done
1064539 i the lord have heard your prayer and seen your tears i will heal you i will add fifteen years to your life
1064540 both reliance and profitable are ready to pay 260 million to own the magpies outright and are determined to spend more than 100 million on transfers to bolster the team managed by kevin keegan
1064541 he has made it clear he will not sanction the kind of huge signings which might help challenge for a champions league place that takes a top four finish in epl
1064542 there is still too much uncertainty and volatility in the economy to target a return to profitability
1064543 the chinese government wont allow the spread of any information that is forbidden by law or harms national interests on the internet
1064544 if a few web sites are difficult to browse its mainly because they have spread content that is banned by the chinese laws
1064545 the internet is regulated according to law in china just like in other countries
1064546 there has been little progress towards fulfilling the chinese authorities promise to improve human rights but rather continued deterioration in key areas
1064547 the organization also condemns the cynicism of the chinese authorities who have yet again lied
1064548 and the iocs inability to prevent this situation because of its refusal to speak out for several years
1064549 to try her on the eve of the games is an extraordinary insult to those who lost their homes to the beijing olympics and shows contempt for human rights concerns raised by the international community
1064550 in our analysis from the information available greenpeace found that beijing achieved and in some cases surpassed original environmental goals
1064551 also missed some opportunities that could have ensured a better short and long term environmental olympic legacy for the city
1064552 the international version of skype is recommended rather than the one available in china which is not secure
1064553 it is also advisable to encrypt e mails with work doesnt have to suck
1064554 what kind of person would do this gentlemen were dealing with someone here who has absolutely no life
1064555 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
1064556 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
1064557 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
1064558 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
1064559 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
1064560 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
1064561 is on the scale of an attack in iraq or afghanistan
1064562 that is something very new they havent had this before
1064563 there are only a very small number of sabotage activities in xinjiang and many were nipped in the bud
1064564 we see that these terrorist groups are not that capable of instigating massive sabotage activities as some hostile forces have hoped to see
1064565 that is supposed to have more protection than other areas
1064566 given the training and the layers of security that chinas authorities have placed on beijing the ability for a conventional terrorist attack is quite severely curtailed
1064567 its clear that the government has taken every precaution possible to protect the olympic venues and those attending the olympics
1064568 it will be very difficult for the etim to mount attacks inside beijing because of the huge investment chinese have made
1064569 but outside beijing it is very difficult to protect from a terrorist attack
1064570 the east turkistan movement is fairly extensive in terms of networks throughout central asia into pakistan
1064571 the uighur separatist network is extensive and its got money behind it probably through criminal activities such as smuggling drugs and arms running
1064572 we have project teams working on a global basis and to help them collaborate effectively we use google apps
1064573 to the best of our knowledge research shows anabolic steroids have absolutely no effect on strength or performance
1064574 why buy a franchise or spend much more for classroom training when you can follow established direct marketer terry jeffers on your own time where you want to listen
1064575 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad

1064579 america is just a much much younger civilization you couldnt find a better version in america of the pantheon of ancient greece than superheroes
1064580 there is still a longing for mythos for a spiritual pantheon and in an era where we have enshrined materialism to such a degree and we have killed off every conceit that seems to be weak and based on religion new age all those types of things the only sort of acceptable mythology i think is superhero mythology
1064581 that is a christian concept rather myths about heroes were accepted as valid narratives about moral truths that helped explain life
1064582 history is filled with men who would be gods but only one god who would be man
1064583 is that the box youre eating are you eating part of that cardboard box
1064584 you can eat all the box you want later in life but cut it out for now okay

1064837 und gegen tottenham war dies in weiten teilen auch der fall
1064838 das ergebnis ist richtig fies wenn man das spiel gesehen hat kann man es aber richtig einordnen
1064839 tottenham ist eine europ ische spitzenmannschaft in vielen situationen haben wir ihr richtige probleme bereitet
1064840 richtig gut gefallen wie wir auf das geduldige spiel des gegners reagiert haben wir sind kompakt geblieben bis die m glichkeit bestand b lle zu erobern
1064841 nach einer viertelstunde waren wir dominant haben uns gute torchancen herausgearbeitet diese aber leider nicht genutzt

1064846 the milwaukee common council has approved agreements that will allow the city of new berlin to tap more lake michigan water for its residents
1064847 praised separate water sharing and regional benefit agreements approved by the milwaukee common council saying the agreements will provide safe and healthy water for new berlin residents while demonstrating regional cooperation on important issues
1064848 the payment recognizes that important issues extend beyond community borders and shows regional support for milwaukees efforts to address shared milwaukee new berlin concerns such as transportation job creation and other issues
1064849 the new berlin water utility will fund the full cost of the one time payment and tax dollars will not be used
1064850 a non compete clause which would prevent another water works from supplying water to new berlin and requires all new berlin residents who receive lake michigan water to be hooked up to the mmsd sanitary sewer line which leads back to lake michigan
1064851 this non compete clause was amended to allow a new berlin company to receive financial incentives to move to the city of milwaukee as long as the company hadnt been actively recruited
1064852 one of the best things about the democratic primaries was that horse race obsessed reporters rarely asked the candidates about education

1064859 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men and this paper that from the french revolution on the whole west has copied from which each of us has drawn inspiration still constitutes the backbone of america her vital lymph know why because it transforms the subjects into citizens because it turns the plebes into people because it invites no it orders the plebes turned into citizens to rebel against tyranny and to govern themselves to express their individualities to search for their own happiness something that for the poor for the plebes means to get rich the exact contrary in short of what the communists used to do with their practice of forbidding people to govern themselves to express themselves to get rich with their practice of installing his majesty the state on the throne
1064860 with this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood
1064861 there is an inverse relationship between reliance on the state and self reliance
1064862 the state exists simply to promote and to protect the ordinary happiness of human beings in this life a husband and wife chatting over a fire a couple of friends having a game of darts in a pub a man reading a book in his own room or digging in his own garden that is what the state is there for and unless they are helping to increase and prolong and protect such moments all the laws parliaments armies courts police economics etc are simply a waste of time
1064863 funny that the same people to whom diversity is a holy word so often bemoan diversity of opinion as divisive but in a democracy politics are naturally divisive you vote for this candidate and someone else votes for that one you vote yes or no on a proposition and other citizens disagree whats not divisive saddam and his 99 96 of the vote thats how it went during the previous iraqi election an illustration of the latin roots of the word fascism which actually means a bunch of sticks all tied together in one big unhappy unified bunch and not despite what many assume any variation from p c received wisdom regarding gay rights affirmative action bilingual education etc this election was different because it was divisive which means it was better
1064864 its all wrong by rights we shouldnt even be here but we are its like in the great stories mr frodo the ones that really mattered full of darkness and danger they were and sometimes you didnt want to know the end because how could the end be happy how could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened but in the end its only a passing thing this shadow even darkness must pass a new day will come and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something even if you were too small to understand why but i think mr frodo i do understand i know now folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnt because they were holding on to something that theres some good in this world mr frodo and its worth fighting for
1064865 w e recognize that we are living in the middle of the most overwhelmingly successful experiment in human history not perfect just the best place in the world to live in thats all

1064867 patriotism means to stand by the country it does not mean to stand by the president or any other public official save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country it is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country it is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country
1064868 so this jefferson dude was like look the reason we left this england place is cause it was so bogus so if we dont get some primo rules ourselves pronto then were just gonna be bogus too
1064869 democracy extends the sphere of individual freedom socialism restricts it democracy attaches all possible value to each man socialism makes each man a mere agent a mere number democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word equality but notice the difference while democracy seeks equality in liberty socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude
1064870 we who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others giving away their last piece of bread they may have been few in number but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing the last of the human freedoms to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones own way
1064871 so traurig tragisch und chaotisch das ist ich glaube aber nicht dass man den verein daf r verantwortlich machen kann weil einige ausrasten und kriminelle handlungen begehen

1064902 these guys are very open and excited about their senior year
1064903 sometimes with players it takes until their senior years for them to understand how to motivate themselves thats what i have now we have seniors but they dont think anything is guaranteed no one feels like its their turn they want to work and they want to win a j price return to form

1064919 the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomization of the query id and the source port
1064920 essentially making it all the more difficult to spoof the dns response however it appears that apple forgot something the client libraries on my osx 10 4 11 system post patch install still does not randomize the source port
1064921 it matters most that they patch the client libraries since there are so few os x recursive servers in use
1064922 yes i killed yvette i hated her so much its like flames flames flames on the side of my face
1064923 addiction to oil is one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1064924 you wont hear me say this too often but i couldnt agree more with the explanation that sen
1064925 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1064926 to do this we will invest 150 billion over the next decade and leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy that harnesses american energy and creates 5 million new american jobs

1064929 will mira have to live a life without her mommy
1064930 what kind of story have i left to tell my work here isnt done yet i have a lot of ammends to make a bad reputaion to live down
1064931 would be outraged to know she was not given that right of first refusal
1064932 she is the only woman in history who has ever garnered this much support
1064933 she is the only woman in history who was able to raise the kind of money one would need to run a presidential campaign
1064934 about one in five voters who supported clinton in the democratic primaries tell pollsters that they are not voting for obama according to a mid july quinnipiac university national poll of likely voters a number thats only slightly lower than when clinton dropped out and the conventional wisdom had it that support would coalesce around the presumptive nominee after a brief cooling off period
1064935 the question is going to be raised are you telling me that this person would be a better qualified vice president than hillary clinton
1064936 i would be very concerned about his judgment if he offered the position to another woman before offering it to hillary clinton
1064937 it seems like the smart choice will be to pick hillary clinton because she adds so much to the ticket but the second choice should be a nominee who supported hillary clinton to try and bring the sides together
1064938 those adamant clinton supporters the older and i would say wealthier women and some of the better known feminists from the dark ages i think they will use his vice presidential choice whether a woman or a man as an excuse not to support him

1064962 um would it be ok if you tried it once with the megaphone sure mark and then he put that little train whistle on it
1064963 i dont really know how its going to work out
1064964 the more time i spend with him the more attached i get so it will be quite hard to be away for five months if i didnt go id regret it for the rest of my life
1064965 when we hang out we go for walks he likes to fly the remote control aeroplane i bought him for christmas and visit friends

1064974 despite reports to the contrary the door is still open for a reconciliation
1064975 rosetta is maintaining a dignified silence with regards to this whole affair she has their children to think about
1064976 as it stands now john will be on the red carpet with her and dont be at all surprised to see jennifer sporting an engagement ring by then these two are serious
1064977 jennifer continues to be more public in her relationship with john than she has with anybody ever
1064978 i most definitely want kids but ill probably adopt i dont know if i can take the kind of pain women go through with childbirth
1064979 maybe in the year 2020 you could just pop a baby out and itd be fine but right now id rather just adopt
1064980 a lacerating rumination on selling out and the allure of fame
1064981 i can be your best friend or your worst enemy

1064994 during pride we took hundreds of pictures and we have a facebook group and when people sign up to that group we encourage them to show their membership to the irb member

1064997 a refugee claimant may not have typical documentation to support their claim
1064998 a member of the board can accept any relevant evidence and then assign an appropriate value to that evidence

1065015 i will serve my old parents in the best way i will

1065051 for clear channel class a am stations we are proposing that the fcc will increase existing protections on the am band and possibly re allocate the class as that stay in such a way that they will have enough protection from other am stations so that they can operate hd radio day and night without creating interference
1065052 this reduction in am noise will allow the remaining class a stations to increase their daytime and nighttime interference free service by removing all other am stations
1065053 no i am not afraid of death any more when i was young the early death of my father cast a shadow over me he died at the age of 27 and i was afraid to die before all my literary plans came true but between 30 and 40 years of age my attitude to death became quite calm and balanced i feel it is a natural but no means the final milestone of ones existence

1065058 women diagnosed with breast cancer face an uphill emotional battle
1065059 at a time when they are forced to deal with their own vulnerabilities women with breast cancer must also navigate the vulnerabilities of loved ones as they react to the news
1065060 women who limit their emotions in discussing their breast cancer diagnosis often limit the possibilities for support they can receive
1065061 involving and including others in an illness increases intimacy among friends and family and opens the door to additional support
1065062 we already know that approximately 25 of men and 9 of women in the middle age bracket in australia stop breathing during sleep at least five times per hour
1065063 however because sleep apnea is strongly associated with obesity and its related diseases it has been difficult in the past to produce clear evidence that increased mortality is a result of osa and not because of other established causes
1065064 that evidence is now available and shows that moderate to severe sleep apnea is associated with about five times the risk of dying after you control for other factors that are already known to cause premature death
1065065 there is a need for high quality clinical trials looking at treatments for sleep apnea that are large enough and long enough to find out whether we can prevent disease or reduce mortality risk
1065066 obstructive sleep apnea is a deadly disease and it is now time for public health and medical practitioners as well as the general public to take it seriously
1065067 the health profession needs to look closely at ways of detecting sleep apnea in children adolescents and young adults to prevent sleep apnea in the over 40 years age group
1065068 sleep apnea prevention is different to obesity prevention as genetic factors related to facial shape and structure also play a role in pathogenesis
1065069 what is most interesting to me as a pediatrician with a mind for prevention is what may also be among the most predictable findings of the study that diving injury peaks substantially during the summer months and that boys are far more likely to be injured than girls
1065070 the summer month exposure will surprise no one males are more affected by nearly all types of injury particularly unintentional injury
1065071 when we first prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy for hiv in 1995 we were concerned about how these drugs changed lipid levels in patients and whether they would increase atherosclerosis and ultimately lead to serious heart disease
1065072 while some studies have found an association between these antiretroviral treatments and increased risk of cardiovascular disease we believe our findings should reassure clinicians that using antiretroviral therapy over time does not appear to put patients at greater risk for coronary atherosclerosis and may in fact be more beneficial than we had initially thought
1065073 this was not surprising since these are the major risk factors for atherosclerosis in the general population
1065074 the purpose of our study however was to investigate whether long term haart usage was a major risk factor
1065075 these results could be due in part to lower lipid values of hiv infected men prior to beginning antiretroviral therapy and high use of lipid lowering drugs the key is that controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis should be a priority
1065076 what remains to be determined is whether use of the newest antiretroviral therapies confers an even better outcome and whether lipid lowering therapies will further improve cardiovascular risk in the hiv infected population our future research will address these questions

1065122 we are very excited about the launch of our new website
1065123 many evolutionary biologists have argued that the different forms of crimson rosellas arose or speciated through ring speciation
1065124 we found that in the case of crimson rosellas their three separate genetic groups dont show a simple link to the geographical distribution of the colour forms
1065125 for example orange adelaide and crimson kangaroo island rosellas are separated by 15km of ocean but are genetically similar conversely genetic dissimilarity was found in the geographically linked yellow and orange populations in inland south eastern australia we rejected the ring hypothesis because it predicts only one region of genetic dissimilarity which should occur at the geographical location of the join in the ring around the headwaters of the murray and murrumbidgee rivers however it is possible that crimson rosellas formed a ring at some stage in their evolutionary history but that the evidence has been lost through climatic or environmental changes
1065126 as a leader in the field of information technology uc san diego has a responsibility to reduce the amount of energy required to run scientific computing systems
1065127 project greenlight will train a new generation of energy aware scientists and it will produce energy consumption data to help investigators throughout the research community make informed choices about energy efficient it infrastructure
1065128 if we are going to continue to allow ourselves the benefits of advances in computing we need to understand power and cooling requirements much better
1065129 scientists from all domains will choose more efficient systems as they invest in new cyberinfrastructure and we expect that greenlight will give them the data they need some scientific computing jobs need more powerful processors some can do with less memory some can use specialized processors these are important requirements to understand so the optimally configured cluster can be chosen and scheduled through virtualization techniques each and every time
1065130 using the sun modular datacenter as a core technology and making all measurements available as open data will form a unique internet accessible resource that will have a dramatic impact on academic government and private sector computing
1065131 by placing experimental hardware configurations alongside traditional rack mounted servers and then running a variety of computational loads on this infrastructure greenlight will enable a new level of insight and inference about real power consumption and energy savings
1065132 we will be running full scale applications on full scale computing platforms so we will be able to draw conclusions about the comparative amount of energy that is consumed by one workload versus another
1065133 we expect that this new approach will re define the fundamentals of computer systems engineering and accelerate adoption of a transformative concept for the computer industry green cyberinfrastructure
1065134 if the networking is transparent the scientists wont care where the computers are as long as the data gets from their devices and back to their screens without delay
1065135 the full scale greenlight instrument will measure monitor and make publicly available real time sensor outputs using a service oriented architecture methodology empowering researchers anywhere to study the energy cost of at scale scientific computing
1065136 its the fastest way to construct a controlled experimental facility for energy research purposes
1065137 computing today is characterized by a very large variation in the amount of effective work delivered per watt depending upon the choice of the architecture and organization of functional blocks
1065138 the project seeks to discover fundamental limits of computing efficiency and device organizing principles that will enable future system builders to architect machines that are orders of magnitude more efficient modern day machines from embedded systems to high performance supercomputers
1065139 we are asking 25 faculty and researchers to work with us with no money for students summer salary or even system administrative support
1065140 we wouldnt be able to retain them and get usable data if we were only offering toy scale computation
1065141 the workshop will feature lectures on the frontiers of green cyberinfrastructure the hardware software and middleware of the greenlight instrument
1065142 and participants will engage in working groups to provide feedback on the projects development and outreach plans going forward
1065143 in general our results show that mutations in the filaggrin gene are extremely strong risk factors for atopic dermatitis and beyond that for hay fever in the case of pre existing eczema they may also cause asthma
1065144 we are now interested in finding out the precise consequences of filaggrin mutations
1065145 the next thing to do is to examine the metabolic pathway of this important protein in addition we want to clarify which molecular mechanisms play a role at the genetic level but also concerning the protein itself then the final aim of course is to find a therapy for patients with atopic diseases
1065146 if a lack of filaggrin is such an important factor in allergic diseases it would be almost conceivable to increase production of this protein or to replace its function in other ways

1065152 women whose husbands work long hours are more likely to quit their jobs yet mens careers are not impacted when their wives put in long hours
1065153 this suggests a potential return to the separate spheres arrangement breadwinning men and homemaking women as long hours become increasingly common
1065154 resurgence of the separate spheres arrangement the effect of spousal overwork on the employment of men and women in dual earner households
1065155 because engineers are worried about cracks forming in composites they currently build many aircraft parts much stronger and therefore heavier than may be necessary so they can withstand a 40 loss in strength during use this means more fuel is needed to get them off the ground and flying to their destinations which is far from ideal in terms of aviations impact on the environment
1065156 nature provides a great deal of inspiration for how we can better engineer high performance structures in addition to strength and stiffness attributes such as toughness and self healing are widely found throughout the range of biological materials many of which are composites this project will seek to understand and implement a variety of innovative and bio inspired approaches to deliver a breakthrough in the performance of advanced composite materials
1065157 valganciclovir has been shown safe in the current study and the population of children treated did not develop ptld warranting future trials to confirm a positive effect in the management of ebv infection
1065158 we have developed a relatively standardized approach to the presence of the high load carrier state which aims to gradually reduce immune suppression while carefully monitoring for any evidence of breakthrough rejection
1065159 we agree that additional trials of valganciclovir are needed to establish a beneficial effect of this drug
1065160 after the strong decrease of the arctic ice during the last summer climate scientists all around the world are constantly asked how will the ice develop in the next years
1065161 to answer this question we did not want to guess but to rely on sound calculations
1065162 through this we are still not able to make a definitive statement on sea ice cover in september this trick enables us to compute the bandwidth of possible ice covers and to quantify the probability of extreme events
1065163 it is a first test and all participating researchers are eager to know how their prognosis has fared at the end of the summer in the end this small competition serves the optimisation of our models so that we are able to improve our predictions concerning short term seasonal fluctuations it has to be added however that even perfect models would not be able to rule out a component of chance regarding the atmosphere these forecasts will always be about probability and not exact prognoses
1065164 given the worlds reliance on coal we need to find ways to make it a cleaner energy source were delighted to be working with our partners in china to help find solutions to this global challenge
1065165 in a recent visit to china prime minister kevin rudd said that china was the largest consumer of coal in the world and australia was the worlds largest exporter of coal as such australia and china should work together develop low emissions coal technologies
1065166 it will allow pcc technology to be progressed in the chinese energy sector which will have a much greater impact than operating in australia alone
1065167 the next steps in the research would be moving to a much larger demonstration phase before then progressing to a full scale system
1065168 smoking cessation interventions would be more appropriate for the british childhood cancer survivor study cohort than smoking prevention interventions because a high proportion of the survivors were older than the age at which most individuals initiate smoking i e 20 years of age
1065169 it is time to think well beyond our disciplinary boundaries and implement inter ventions that we know are efficacious such as provider delivered counseling and pharmacotherapy and seek solutions for the social conditions that serve as a trajectory for a lifetime of smoking
1065170 our findings indicate that the initial hospital costs associated with penetrating trauma are substantial and vary to a considerable degree by patient injury and treatment characteristics
1065171 although the costs of penetrating trauma resulting from shooting are higher than from stabbing the most commonly used weapon in violent crime in england and wales is actually a knife
1065172 at an average cost of 7 699 per penetrating injury from alleged assault and a total of 417 injuries per year requiring hospitalisation for at least three days the total acute care cost of this type of injury alone may exceed 3 2 million annually
1065173 public health initiatives that aim to reduce the incidence and severity of penetrating trauma are therefore likely to produce significant savings in acute trauma care costs
1065174 considering the additional medical costs of rehabilitation and broader costs to society resulting from lost productivity permanent disability premature death and the pain and suffering of the victims and their families there is a compelling argument for money to be better spent on prevention strategies that reduce violent incidents
1065175 it should be borne in mind that most of the cost of trauma especially stabbing is not to the health service but in billions per annum to the taxpayer through legal costs loss of productive tax paying years in those that die or are severely disabled and in long term care
1065176 the united states loses four percent of the gross national product due to alloy corrosion
1065177 a network of continuous metal nanoparticles allow the carbon to dissolve and diffuse through the protective oxide scales without the need of a crack or a pore
1065178 by examining the oxide scale we find the metal nanoparticles
1065179 if they are eliminated we can create a more corrosion resistant and longer lasting alloy

1065186 the smallest pore size is the key to the strength of porous materials and what they can do
1065187 seeing inside bulk porous materials has never been done before at this resolution making this one of the first applications of x ray diffractive microscopy to a real problem
1065188 the strength and stiffness of foam like structures are expected to scale with their density relating the density of individual elements like beams and nodes to the overall density
1065189 but below about 10 percent density the strength of aerogels like the ones we tested on the order of 1 percent density is orders of magnitude less than expected
1065190 the high resolution we achieved allowed us to see which of these models more accurately described the actual observed structure
1065191 the structure was far more complex than anything wed seen in earlier images obtained using this technique
1065192 wed like to use x ray diffraction to study a range of porous materials and nanostructures in general for example porous polymers developed at the molecular foundry for storing hydrogen as fuel and at even higher resolutions
1065193 to do so david shapiro who built the end station we used for this work is working with us to overcome some obstacles
1065194 and after all this you can find out the sample was no good so you have to start over
1065195 we are also collaborating with berkeley labs computational research division to develop efficient and robust algorithms to speed up the time needed to construct the 3 d image from the individual rotated views
1065196 this will open an entire spectrum of possibilities for new ways of seeing the very small not just aerogels but virtually any unknown object from nanostructures to biological cells

1065199 were still waiting on the doctors to give us the timetable on when were going to have this procedure done
1065200 i will not put myself into a position where i have to defend myself to state my side of the story theres no side
1065201 theres only one side a lack of judgment on my part thats really all i have to say i have no excuse all i have is the opportunity to gain the respect of my fans to gain the respect of my family gain the respect of my co workers and gain the respect of the organization
1065202 im a fallen man im a man that made a mistake
1065203 i plan to mend the bridges that ive burned and help rebuild the bridge if i need to all by myself
1065204 the good thing is that we were both man enough to come face to face and talk without any other kind of altercations
1065205 were bigger than that sometimes when emotions are involved you do stupid things for me being a christian i have a forgiving heart and im willing to move forward to help this team win this year
1065206 we still have some more things to talk about as far as what can we do to be able to go out there and coexist on the same field same team and be productive and help this team win this year
1065207 only two men can do that and feel like we have what it takes in order to do so

1065210 previous research has shown that stroke patients who were depressed did not regain function as well as other patients and they had a higher risk of dying all patients who have suffered a stroke are now screened for depression but this is not the case for patients at any stage of cancer

1065212 depression affects 25 of patients with advanced cancer but at this stage it is difficult to diagnose whilst patients with advanced cancer are clearly very ill they can still be effectively treated for depression but the first step in the treatment is the recognition that the patient is depressed

1065304 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1065305 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world

1065313 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
1065314 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1065315 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
1065316 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
1065317 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out

1065321 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
1065322 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today

1065330 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1065331 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1065332 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1065333 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1065334 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1065335 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1065336 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1065337 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1065338 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1065339 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race

1065344 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1065345 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1065346 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable

1065349 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
1065350 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
1065351 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
1065352 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
1065353 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
1065354 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
1065355 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
1065356 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
1065357 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
1065358 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
1065359 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
1065360 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
1065361 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
1065362 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
1065363 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
1065364 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
1065365 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
1065366 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
1065367 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
1065368 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
1065369 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
1065370 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
1065371 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1065372 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1065373 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1065374 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him

1065380 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1065381 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
1065382 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
1065383 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1065384 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years

1065421 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun

1065423 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
1065424 websites van bedrijven zijn nu hele bergen tekst de overgang naar veel meer beeld komt eraan
1065425 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1065426 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1065427 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1065428 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1065429 can you please tell me what the lottery numbers will be in the next drawing
1065430 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
1065431 websites van bedrijven zijn nu hele bergen tekst de overgang naar veel meer beeld komt eraan
1065432 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
1065433 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
1065434 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
1065435 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
1065436 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1065437 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1065438 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
1065439 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
1065440 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
1065441 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1065442 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1065443 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1065444 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
1065445 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
1065446 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
1065447 if you talk to the average marine over in al anbar they are bored ill be quite honest with you i mean you talk to them weve got infantry battalions that go over now and they dont fire their weapon not one in anger
1065448 but they also know that thats a positive turnaround so thats a good thing for us but you get the young marines and you know how it is they want combat
1065449 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1065450 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1065451 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
1065452 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1065453 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1065454 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
1065455 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
1065456 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
1065457 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1065458 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1065459 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1065460 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1065461 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
1065462 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
1065463 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
1065464 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1065465 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1065466 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
1065467 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
1065468 weve tried to maximize the use of these moments with our founder and chairman al gore so that we can continue the momentum not just for our campaign but to keep the cause at the top of the news
1065469 the challenge gore laid down today becomes a focal point and a rallying call for pr efforts around the campaign it gives our grassroots effort something to rally around
1065470 these national conversations about oil prices energy and what are people going to do the idea to drill more as a solution thats the reason we needed to do this today to start to put a different framework around the issues
1065471 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
1065472 im gonna get me so of that reward and shut that mans pie hole up once and for all
1065473 i never heard a man moan so much about anything much less about global warming and the coming judgment day he done scared the hell out of my chickens now they dont lay as many eggs as before
1065474 when im done thinking up something that will finally shut that man up i just know my chickens will be laying like the used to
1065475 but for now theyll have to wear ear plugs you best get a pair too because its gonna be a long ten years of hearing that man talking without them
1065476 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
1065477 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1065478 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
1065479 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1065480 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
1065481 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
1065482 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
1065483 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
1065484 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
1065485 women fought for trousers were doing the same with the skirt
1065486 keep windows and blinds shit during the day then throw them open at night get what air there is circulating if its still baking consider decamping is there a cooler room in the house
1065487 some people place ingenious home cooling devices trays of ice cubes balanced on stools wet towels suspended from chairs between fan and bed so the air that reaches them is ready chilled
1065488 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but he did not endorse he did not come out with a strong decision
1065489 i predict to you hell find reasons not to be for it if this comes to a vote in the senate
1065490 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
1065491 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
1065492 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
1065493 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
1065494 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
1065495 perhaps your reward will be in heaven not here on earth
1065496 f r e e that spells free creditreport com baby saw their ads on my tv thought about going but was too lazy
1065497 i love it that means the ads are totally calvin totally provocative and a little controversial
1065498 take them off fold the leg at the mark and iron the fold
1065499 then cut just under the crease with fabric scissors lay the short jean leg on top of the other side and cut to evenly match
1065500 males fly around while females sit in trees in shrubs or on the ground so find a female and watch her blinking pattern then imitate the pattern with a pen flashlight and the males will come to you
1065501 he voted against that bill we need people who understand that and not necessarily toe the party line but do the right thing for the american people
1065502 wake up call caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
1065503 i want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed
1065504 leave the blue outfit at home we will not need it
1065505 and thats when my dumbness lifted and i figured it out then i started crying because im an emotional basketcase whiner baby an hour and a half later i was in a taxi cab heading toward manhattan and i had sucked up my tears just sayin
1065506 and he rolled his eyes and gave us a half ass wave whatever matt we were excited to see your dumb ass even though
1065507 shhhhhh he doesnt really mean it he is just trying to appeal to the tree hugger types
1065508 he is saying much more libertarian sounding things in private conversations
1065509 there obviously is a role for government theres a role for private industry theres a role for nonprofits and certainly a role for the american people individually and collectively
1065510 you dont see where all the carbon goes so there is a misconception that woody species such as trees and shrubs store more carbon thats just not the case
1065511 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1065512 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1065513 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1065514 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1065515 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1065516 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1065517 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1065518 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1065519 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1065520 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1065521 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1065522 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1065523 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1065524 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1065525 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
1065526 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
1065527 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
1065528 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
1065529 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
1065530 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
1065531 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
1065532 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
1065533 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
1065534 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
1065535 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
1065536 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
1065537 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
1065538 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
1065539 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
1065540 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1065541 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
1065542 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1065543 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
1065544 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
1065545 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
1065546 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
1065547 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
1065548 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
1065549 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
1065550 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1065551 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
1065552 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
1065553 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1065554 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
1065555 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
1065556 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1065557 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
1065558 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1065559 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1065560 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
1065561 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
1065562 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
1065563 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
1065564 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
1065565 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1065566 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1065567 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1065568 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1065569 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1065570 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
1065571 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
1065572 women fought for trousers were doing the same with the skirt
1065573 keep windows and blinds shit during the day then throw them open at night get what air there is circulating if its still baking consider decamping is there a cooler room in the house

1065591 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
1065592 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
1065593 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
1065594 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american

1065597 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1065598 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
1065599 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
1065600 or havent you told them how we raise the rent money

1065608 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
1065609 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1065610 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
1065611 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1065612 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1065613 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1065614 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1065615 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1065616 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable

1065647 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind

1065667 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1065668 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense

1065682 where there is a need to know and a right to know the information in the performance of a law enforcement activity
1065683 when the information falls within the law enforcement counterterrorism or national security responsibility of the receiving agency or may assist in preventing crime or the use of violence or any conduct dangerous to human life or property
1065684 a government official or any other individual when necessary to avoid imminent danger to life or liberty
1065685 the intent of the propose revisions to part 23 is to not create unreasonable impediments to information sharing
1065686 another incremental shift away from law enforcement acting within the law

1065693 theres nothing that you can do with steroids that you couldnt do without them
1065694 they cant give you strength that you couldnt come by naturally among the elite shot putters it doesnt come down to whos doing steroids or not the big natural athlete is going to come through
1065695 if it just came down to something you got from a bottle whether there was testing or not somebody would be throwing 80 feet
1065696 under u s standards it is inconceivable that a sample to be used as evidence against an accused person would have gone through the process that mr barnes sample did and still constitute reliable evidence
1065697 the roids seem to give you that psychological crutch and i experience cramps and stuff with them i dont think theyre that great people who are using roids its to come up to a high level but once youre up there you dont need them anymore
1065698 i was just 19 at the olympics in 64 and we knew that steroids were out there that the eastern europeans were doing them
1065699 we used to use caffeine pills sometimes but they didnt help me at all it messed up my timing and my technique just getting things out of balance if caffeine can do that to you steroids probably could too maybe you get stronger in one way but slower somewhere else the emphasis at every level seems to be strength but its how you apply that strength and athletic ability i look at shot putters today and a lot of them dont look like great athletes stronger than i ever was but they had bellies on them paunches i dont see how that translates into good footwork good technique and speed randy barnes and brian oldfield were just tremendous athletes at indoor events brian used to beat nfl running backs in the 50 yards and he could high jump 6 6 at 280 pounds
1065700 the strength athlete has to have the ability to physically adapt
1065701 whether its the shot put olympic lifting or the worlds strongest man its a test of applied strength strength without speed or flexibility or technique or the need to compete isnt enough in any of the disciplines the shot put records are out there because those throwers were just amazing athletes brian revolutionized the event by bringing in the discus style spin to the shot put and broke the record by feet i always think his ability was untapped
1065702 i guess new generation talent went elsewhere for a long time
1065703 brian oldfield threw 75 in 1975 when no one else could throw 72 and no one would break that mark for 12 long years
1065704 i started mimicking oldfields technique in 1986 unfortunately many erroneously believed that oldfield was such a freakish talent that whatever he did couldnt possibly apply to their mortal selves they were never more wrong i trusted it and followed it without asking questions and the better i got the more i was able to understand what he was doing that made the spin technique work so well
1065705 the most amazing feat of strength i ever saw was alexeyev military pressing 500 pounds
1065706 he lifted what was necessary to win and then to break the record each time by a minimal amount just so he could collect a bonus each time
1065707 it might be that we never saw him test himself with the most he could have lifted

1065748 were in shock theyre very responsible and organized top notch people apparently one relied on the other and this is what happened
1065749 the story is what he says in his sworn testimony if its truthful it would support mr simpsons defense

1065751 we need more nuclear power we need clean coal technology we need to offshore drill for oil and natural gas we need to drill now
1065752 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to meet the challenges we face or isnt giving the american people straight talk

1065762 we went to a lot of auctions and we would buy something we liked and it all went in the basement
1065763 it looked as though one time we had too much stuff in the basement
1065764 when we hit 10 000 miles coming home our speedometer broke
1065765 im trying to find out the secret to that skin to live to be 100 and to be in as good shape as virgilia i think its wonderful

1065767 we can buy up to 120 percent of what we contracted for in this years budget
1065768 and we can save 10 000 to 15 000 by doing that this year by sept 1
1065769 its going to be a difficult budget this year not just in palmyra but also in the rest of new york state

1065772 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1065773 this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1065774 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1065775 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil

1065785 we are disappointed that we have not yet received a response from iran
1065786 we agreed in the absence of a clear positive response from iran that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1065787 the incentives package contained everything iran needed to pursue a modern civil nuclear power program which irans leaders claim is their aim the pressure on iran to comply with the demands of the international community and its u n security council obligations will only grow

1065805 bei meinen gespr chen mit solschenizyn habe ich das wichtigste verstanden er hat m chtig geschuftet m iggang war ihm absolut fremd

1065807 alexander solschenizyn hat die realien des sowjetischen systems enth llt und seine erfahrungen der ganzen welt mitgeteilt
1065808 er verachtete den kapitalismus und die neue generation russischer oligarchen das entsprach nicht der mode in den letzten jahren verschwand er daher aus der sicht obwohl unter pr sident putin seine popularit t erneut zunahm

1065835 the judges opinion is all that matters now isnt it
1065836 as plaintiff is proceeding pro se and is ostensibly neither an attorney nor well versed in the law and procedure involved in the pursuit of his claim this court recommends that he seek counsel before proceeding further in what appears to be a complex action
1065837 ive read rico ray does not understand the law at all
1065838 nor does plaintiff cite to any law to support his legal assertion that he is entitled to a tro rather plaintiff offers one mere conclusory statement that he is likely to prevail on the merits of his claim and that the continued publication of the rayfaq website will cause irreparable harm to plaintiff not limited to damage to his reputation employment and investment prospects without more than mere conclusions this court cannot consider and weigh the factors necessary for the issuance of a tro accordingly plaintiffs motion for temporary injunctive relief is denied
1065839 specifically plaintiffs excuse that he did not learn of this courts ruling for two weeks on his ifp motion is disingenuous according to this courts docket report plaintiffs ifp motion was filed on september 10 2002 decided on september 12 2002 and the order mailed to him on september 16 2002 on september 18 2002 just eight 8 days after plaintiff filed his ifp motion plaintiff submitted his 150 00 filing fee to the clerk of court presumably in response to this courts denial of his ifp motion plaintiff misrepresents the alleged delay as the docket report clearly indicates that he knew of the decision prior to the passage of two weeks time
1065840 notwithstanding the force of authority requiring personal service under rule 45 plaintiff has not demonstrated that he has expended any effort whatsoever to identify the defendants or to serve the subpoenas upon the isps and thus his assertion that the costs are prohibitive and beyond his means is mere speculation

1065924 the judges opinion is all that matters now isnt it
1065925 as plaintiff is proceeding pro se and is ostensibly neither an attorney nor well versed in the law and procedure involved in the pursuit of his claim this court recommends that he seek counsel before proceeding further in what appears to be a complex action
1065926 ive read rico ray does not understand the law at all
1065927 nor does plaintiff cite to any law to support his legal assertion that he is entitled to a tro rather plaintiff offers one mere conclusory statement that he is likely to prevail on the merits of his claim and that the continued publication of the rayfaq website will cause irreparable harm to plaintiff not limited to damage to his reputation employment and investment prospects without more than mere conclusions this court cannot consider and weigh the factors necessary for the issuance of a tro accordingly plaintiffs motion for temporary injunctive relief is denied
1065928 specifically plaintiffs excuse that he did not learn of this courts ruling for two weeks on his ifp motion is disingenuous according to this courts docket report plaintiffs ifp motion was filed on september 10 2002 decided on september 12 2002 and the order mailed to him on september 16 2002 on september 18 2002 just eight 8 days after plaintiff filed his ifp motion plaintiff submitted his 150 00 filing fee to the clerk of court presumably in response to this courts denial of his ifp motion plaintiff misrepresents the alleged delay as the docket report clearly indicates that he knew of the decision prior to the passage of two weeks time
1065929 notwithstanding the force of authority requiring personal service under rule 45 plaintiff has not demonstrated that he has expended any effort whatsoever to identify the defendants or to serve the subpoenas upon the isps and thus his assertion that the costs are prohibitive and beyond his means is mere speculation

1065937 we must end the age of oil in our time

1065947 i have to make sure i know everything in the playbook
1065948 but for me its a little different because i know that coach gruden is going to spot play me i think there may be some trick plays some decoy routes that kind of stuff
1065949 all i can say is that he goes inside in walk throughs and gets a lot of reps but it is going to take some time before he can really let it loose
1065950 so i have to learn when i see a cornerback pressed up on me is he going to bail or just press me are they going to be in man or what

1066075 jim zemlin executive director for the linux foundation gave a talk at linuxworld saying that the open source community should stop poking fun at microsoft from the vnu article open source vendors have to recognize that windows is here to stay and that together with microsoft it will form a duopoly in the market for operating systems this also requires that the linux community respects microsoft rather than ridicule it
1066076 so hes essentially saying i should respect microsoft for thinking up all the dirty tricks it used to get its monopoly in the first place i am not convinced
1066077 why should i have any respect for an organisation thats been convicted of anti competitive practices on 2 continents microsoft is a bunch of crooks selling a third rate products respect has to earned not expected
1066078 what is this hug a grizzly bear week be nice to the sharks month this man zemlin is obviously either a shill or a sad deluded man who needs to be shipped off to the re education camps as soon as possible
1066079 im supposed to respect them because theyre bigger than everyone else and thus can put more money into marketing and abuse their monopoly to crush competitors with underhanded tactics how about they stop making shitty software and play nice with everyone else maybe id respect them then but ill certainly not respect them for what they do now
1066080 linux geeks should just treat microsoft the way the chinese government treats the us government a necessary enemy only there as a stepping stone to sovereignty or self sufficiency let them tout themselves let them think theyre winning and then when the chips are down yank the last card from their house of cards and watch them fall
1066081 microsoft didnt get where they are primarily by the strength of their technology offerings but by other less ethical means
1066082 the message behind this suggestion seems to be more a message to
1066083 yes windows has contributed much for everyday users of computers it has made many things possible that may not have been possible otherwise and it will continue to be the best path towards many kinds of progress for the everyday use of computers going forward for the immediately foreseeable future

1066097 prices never come down as fast as they go up

1066099 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices

1066217 cmon with the iphone comparisons already this isnt even a phone if youre going to compare it with something how bout the iriver clix that pre dated the iphone by a year that would make more sense
1066218 wait wait wait theyve released the iphone nano how does the iphone nano work can you be an impostor of something that doesnt exist i guess a horse with a carrot taped to its head could be called a unicorn impostor why dont we give them credit for coming to the market with a device that may have the iphones features in a smaller package
1066219 i agree bigswirv how can it be like the nano well i guess its the i phone all over again biting the lg prada someone should do some research and find out if gizmodo is owned by apple

1066230 their skin seemed to be falling from their bones and old scars and sores long healed reopened their bodies were literally falling apart we know now that scurvy is brought upon by a lack of vitamin c the sailors back then did not know this and so their meals still consisted of meat fish and bread the captains of the ship seemed mysteriously immune to scurvy they thought by mere luck but the actual reason was that they were able to sneak in an apple into their meals sailors not actually knowing why ate rats
1066231 the gums of both the lower and upper teeth of some of our men swelled so that they could not eat under any circumstances

1066236 the gums of both the lower and upper teeth of some of our men swelled so that they could not eat under any circumstances

1066274 more than three out of four people support the law and compliance has been virtually 100 per cent
1066275 not only do these policies achieve their aim of protecting the health of non smokers by decreasing exposure to second hand smoke they also have many effects on smoking behavior which compound the health benefits

1066289 we have noticed decent inventories of the iphone at stores and thin demand at best
1066290 in fact most apple store visitors were not looking at the device and only a very small subset bought it
1066291 very true the iphone sales are a very insignificant portion of profits especially considering it was 2 days of sales on 60 which as pointed out by gil is not even 10mill and has zero to do with at amp ts profits for q2 not to mention the lower than talked about number of iphones sold would be seen as more a detriment to expected profits based on iphone than anything else
1066292 this has to be the most apple biased article written for this site ever the iphone had little or nothing to do with at amp ts q2 profit for one there were a millions in marketing costs that went into the launch of the iphone by at amp t as part of their exclusive arrangement with apple they were solely on the hook for those costs second only the activation fee is reported as income at the time of the sale monthly subscriber income is reported in the month and quarter in which it is billed im guessing that at amp ts profit margin on the actual hardware was little nothing or even a loss again based on the exclusive they have with apple overall revenue from equipment sales were down 7 4 for q2 in the wireless segment
1066293 the title of this article is crap and misleading if you listened to at amp ts earnings conference call this morning you would know that they activated 146 000 iphones and said 40 of that number were new customers if you do the math the iphone had very very very very very little impact on the 1 5 new customers at amp t wireless in q2 only 58 400 make up the 1 5 million new customers added you people on these blogs need to do a little research before you post crap like this

1066303 athletes from across scotland and the rest of the uk will be taking part in the beijing olympics and fans should be allowed to show their support by waving the national flag of their choice
1066304 with participants like andy murray often wearing saltires on their kit as a symbol of national pride it will be a shame if fans are not able to echo that by waving saltires from the stands
1066305 i will be writing to the british olympic association and the international olympic committee and urging them to challenge this ruling
1066306 on previous occasions scottish athletes have been prevented from sporting a saltire it would be unfortunate where any athlete to find themselves in that position again
1066307 the olympics should be a global celebration of different cultures and nationalities with this meeting in beijing offering an opportunity for dialogue over the future of tibet

1066323 when i am working on a problem i never think about beauty but when i have finished if the solution is not beautiful i know it is wrong
1066324 this problem can be compounded by an interface being dictated entirely by a designer

1066340 the money is there but the solutions arent designers can contribute were pretty good at taking a bunch of disparate components and figuring out the solution
1066341 what is happening is more or less normal for a 1 0 product i wish that apple spent some more time and money to heavily test their jesusphone but the market pressure was too big
1066342 when you put such a groundbreaking device in peoples hands a communicating and computing platform that offers such an awesome user experience and allows for so many great things the best thing is to allow everyone to fly with it
1066343 some users will be happy to enjoy the box as it is but at the end what really matters is what other people may dream to do with the iphone not only what apple with their limited resources think i know it sounds preachy and naive but to allow people make real those dreams is what will make this platform not only amazing but insanely great
1066344 totally fake you can see the black box extended to the stainless steel part of the iphone some people just wanted to spread bad news shame on you

1066353 jason fried jwright thanks for the advice on how we should develop our products but we feel like we have it under control we know what were doing
1066354 we discovered that visitors will return to websites to which they have no loyalty simply because theyre familiar with the interface as soon as someone directs the individual to a competitors website and the individual determines the competitors website is less painful to navigate theyre gone
1066355 research findings point out that it takes more effort to develop new markets than to keep existing customers and that existing customers tend to spend more money than new customers do repeat purchase behaviors occur after products are used hence how to manage customer loyalty by means of product design becomes a critical issue to product designers and a key for company prosperity
1066356 in short it appears as many suspect that distrust of the internet undermines e commerce specifically those who perceive greater risks on the internet are less likely to shop online in turn perceptions of risks are associated with bad experiences online
1066357 the key finding is that trust is a long term proposition that builds slowly as people use a site get good results and dont feel let down or cheated in other words true trust comes from a companys actual behavior towards customers experienced over an extended set of encounters its hard to build and easy to lose a single violation of trust can destroy years of slowly accumulated credibility
1066358 guideline 7 make your site easy to use and useful
1066359 the rule of thumb in many usability aware organizations is that the cost benefit ratio for usability is 1 10 100 once a system is in development correcting a problem costs 10 times as much as fixing the same problem in design if the system has been released it costs 100 times as much relative to fixing in design
1066360 the average ui has some 40 flaws correcting the easiest 20 of these yields an average improvement in usability of 50 the big win however occurs when usability is factored in from the beginning this can yield efficiency improvements of over 700
1066361 ibms web presence has traditionally been made up of a difficult to navigate labyrinth of disparate subsites but a redesign made it more cohesive and user friendly according to ibm the massive redesign effort quickly paid dividends the company said in the month after the february 1999 re launch that traffic to the shop ibm online store increased 120 percent and sales went up 400 percent
1066362 in our first year we didnt spend a single dollar on advertising
1066363 improving user experience can increase both revenue and customer satisfaction while lowering costs
1066364 on the web customer retention can be defined as whether or not a customer decides to return to a website in terms of metrics this can be quantified as the number of customers who a intend to return and b intend to purchase again from the website
1066365 two important aspects of the overall consumer satisfaction are i the level of satisfaction associated with the final chosen product e
1066366 a systematic approach for coupling user satisfaction with product design
1066367 jupiter communications reports that word of mouth is second only to a strong offline brand in building consumer trust almost half of consumers surveyed by jupiter cite word of mouth as a key influence in their online shopping habits the average u s adult online shopper now tells about 12 other people including family friends relatives and co workers about their online shopping experiences contrast this to the average of nine people who hear rave movie reviews or six who are told about great restaurants
1066368 when consumers control the message when real people are the biggest advertisers
1066369 a recent survey by opinion research discovered that online shopping escapades start more tongues wagging than either movies or restaurants

1066374 my god you have the novel in your head write it
1066375 thats exactly what jose antonio bravo the novelist from peru in my session of the iwp said to me the night before he left iowa and he wrote in a strange way he planned his novels like an architect with large sheets of paper on which he drew categories of major characters minor characters theme story chronology etc and when it was ready he wrote
1066376 when i say i wrote jagua nana in nine days people think i am not a serious writer
1066377 in real life when amin announced the expulsion of asians and gave them a deadline of three months the time seemed so short it made everybody and everything frantic but in the novel three months is such a long time that it does not persuade the reader that there is any reason for the people to get frantic
1066378 why dont you change the expulsion deadline from three months to the next moon
1066379 amin is a muslim so reference to the moon is not illogical and while people are rushing around to find out what by the next moon means that will explain why everything gets frantic

1066388 the sandras had these kinds of issues or reacted to the prototype in this way
1066389 oh yes and by the way the user in this country in china or in india struggles particularly with these localization issues for example
1066390 have personas been proven to be the best design and or marketing strategy tool versus more standard design techniques which view the customer base as being more diverse than a single persona and thus segmented accordingly
1066391 are there concrete measurements of the success roi for implementing personas versus traditional design marketing approaches
1066392 hey lets do some further research or do some user testing weve never done that before or lets do a focus group or lets do some user survey stuff

1066428 usability testing must be conducted in the users natural setting
1066429 you need to test your website with hundreds of users
1066430 dont take the user down the garden path to do something
1066431 navigation is not important users dont care where they are in the website
1066432 website usability can be measured by proprietary software agents or algorithms
1066433 technique that models human perceptual cognitive and motor behavior and is programmed with a set of characteristics and web browsing behavior that represents the way an average user sees thinks and moves through a web site
1066434 usability testing must be conducted in the users natural setting
1066435 ethnography is a relatively low cost way to identify potentially critical customer needs its an important source of new product ideas and it has the potential to redirect a companys technological capabilities toward entirely new businesses
1066436 ethnography is a technique developed largely by anthropologist margaret mead
1066437 the famous anthropologist margaret mead is credited with founding the area of ethnography within the field of anthropology
1066438 to move complex and less frequently used options out of the main user interface and into secondary screens
1066439 make more information available within reach but dont overwhelm the user with all the features and possibilities
1066440 single computer application word processor and a single interface style menu based control
1066441 good usability includes ideas like progressive disclosure where you show a small number of features to the less experienced user to lower the hurdle of getting started and yet have a larger number of features available for the expert to call up
1066442 progressive disclosure is the best tool so far show people the basics first and once they understand that allow them to get to the expert features but dont show everything all at once or you will only confuse people and they will waste endless time messing with features that they dont need yet
1066443 only show information that is relevant to the task the user wants to focus on on any given page
1066444 these findings show what a significant portion of conversion activity takes place well beyond the impression
1066445 it also reveals how lasting the effect of an impression can be
1066446 beyond the five user assumption benefits of increased sample sizes in usability testing
1066447 i refer to configuration in its broadest sense a user must perform some advanced action in order to get some desired result from software a web site or a product experience typically the term configuration means to adjust or change settings hiding activating or altering useful features and system behaviors this article explains why you might not be able to relate to why configuration is such a major usability issue for average users average users people who dont work with computers for a living 1 on the web a shopping cart is a type of configuration experience when you remove an item and forget to update the cart your cart will be inaccurate playing with a poor shopping cart is a symptom of configuration hell navigation usability issues can be seen as a type of configuration snafu in the sense that users are trying to steer a website in a particular direction to serve up the desired pages or functionality changing an interface from current state to desired state is the basic unit of the task of configuration demo
1066448 we dont know what the perfect default should really be
1066449 we want to let our users be the final judge
1066450 users can go into these advanced settings to change things
1066451 to begin with or to add additional power to the functionality configuration must occur
1066452 using a site with high appeal but very low in perceived usability yielded very high satisfaction but low perceived usability scores suggesting that what is beautiful need not also be perceived to be usable the results suggest that web designers may need to pay attention to both visual appeal and usability
1066453 usability professionals need to wake up to the fact that aesthetics are not a trivial afterthought but an integral part of the user experience
1066454 an annual massachusetts institute of technology survey known as the lemelson mit invention index found that among adults asked what invention they hate most but cant live without 30 percent said the cell phone alarm clocks were a close second with 25 percent followed by the television with 23 percent and razors with 14 percent microwave ovens computers and answering machines also earned spots as detested technology
1066455 part of the reason again is the added expense in a competitive market but the main reason is simply that consumers dont think they need it
1066456 emotion as a cognitive artifact and the implications for products that are perceived as pleasurable
1066457 emotions appear so antithetical to thinking that they are said to interfere with it clear thinking supposedly requires eliminating emotions
1066458 our traditional idea is that there is something called thinking and that it is contaminated modulated or affected by emotions what i am saying is that emotions arent separate
1066459 up to recently however i could not make the connection between usability and aesthetics they were distinct spheres of my life now however i have figured out the relationship
1066460 one of the worlds most extreme anti israel academics gordon belongs to the class of rabidly anti israel far left professors whose trademark is the delight they take in comparing israel to apartheid south africa and nazi germany
1066461 with the protesting and this and that we need to get a real strong jewish studies program in there hopefully it will be enlightening to have a visiting professor and itll calm down over there more
1066462 the abject silence on the part of the canadian arab federation in the face of vitriolic attacks on jews by muslim perpetrators is tantamount to tacit approval of anti semitism and gives a green light to others who would entertain the notion of attacking jews
1066463 taj approached the group of teenagers around 10 45 pm and asked
1066464 he then slapped her in the face and pulled her hair before her friends jessica motta kayla hungle and daniel ball attempted to intervene
1066465 the canadian arab federation has not only not uttered one word of condemnation for this horrific attack but they have remained silent in the face of arson attacks in canada directed against shuls and jewish community centers and violent attacks on jewish students on local university campuses
1066466 a jewish camp in northern ontario was attacked no one was hurt but property was smashed and tires slashed sending a clear message the camp staff was told by the town that jews were no longer welcome in their stores
1066467 jewish businesses in canada are picketed by groups supported by the caf claiming these businesses support israeli apartheid
1066468 making a strong case that it is every bit as radical and unhinged
1066469 a fully paid up member of the anglo saxon mafia
1066470 muhammed is the messenger of allah and those who are with him are harsh towards the kuffar and compassionate towards each other
1066471 it is the ideology of the muslim brotherhood that justifies and promotes attacks on jews in canada
1066472 some kind of form must be signed that prohibits entry into canada of people that believe in the muslim brotherhood ideology this would make it possible to conduct denaturalization and deportation proceedings
1066473 jakob nielsen has an unhealthy monopoly on usability consciousness he promotes best practices he preaches obedience to his guidelines and when he postulates opinions they are interpreted as instructions
1066474 in the future first of all websites will be designed by my guidelines for the simple reason that if they dont they are dead

1066508 i dont know i think so its normal because when there is speculation they believe in what they read
1066509 for me the most important thing is to keep on playing my football and enjoying myself no matter what you are no matter what you have done some of the fans will love you and some of the fans will hate you
1066510 but i hope im in a good situation most of the fans love me and thats the most important thing
1066511 for me what happened in the summer is already behind me and now its up to me to play my game and score some goals
1066512 football fans are like that you show them that you are happy and that you have the desire to want to play for your team
1066513 i will try to do that all this year since the beginning of the discussions i always told the boss of my desire to stay with the club
1066514 when you net 30 goals in a season a lot of clubs come to look for you but this club is one of the biggest in the world
1066515 its fun we have a lot of young players and i have the chance for a good career at this club
1066516 the players have made this decision to show their solidarity and in protest of the leagues violation of the collective bargaining agreement with respect to the negotiation of bonuses for this tournament
1066517 it is good to get off to a good start
1066518 the boys have performed well and it is good to come in and get off to a winning start
1066519 it has been a bit of rollercoaster to be fair i think i signed on thursday then got my first bit of football in training and straight into a tournament situation it was really good for me
1066520 i was working hard on my own at blackburn and the people at blackburn helped me out and kept me fit
1066521 it is good to be involved with the lads now and in a tournament basis like this it is good to get some minutes under my belt
1066522 i think any of the top four can win the title
1066523 i am not going to say we are going to win it because you never know i hope we can do it
1066524 i am committed to winning it and if you look around so is everyone here arsenal have to win something every year that is our aim if it is not happening then everyone is really disappointed
1066525 it is a good sign that he will be staying because it took him a while to agree a new deal i am happy that he has committed his future to arsenal
1066526 yesterday we showed that ade and i have a few nice combinations together that is really important for two strikers you always have to work together you always have to look for each other
1066527 of course i wanted everyone to stay but this is not how life is
1066528 players leaving is part of football those things happen flamini was a free agent so he could make this decision alex went but this is football and has been happening for years
1066529 i hope this season will not be so unlucky with injuries
1066530 i just do not want to think about that negative stuff if you think positive you get positive
1066531 i am getting better taking steps every day and am really happy with how it is going my target is to be as fit as possible after a month because the season is long
1066532 i learned a lot in the last two years because i have been injured so much

1066534 hes a young player i tried to sign before and im interested but the price has got to be right we cant be paying over the top youve got to pay what you consider to be a fair price for players
1066535 i think clubs like us need to do a deal where if you go and play games and theyre successful great you pay the money
1066536 if players come and they dont do the business i think youve got to be more creative with doing transfers if theyre successful you dont mind paying

1066541 jacen reflected bitterly that a large part of growing up seemed to involve watching everything change and discovering that all changes are permanent that nothing ever chagnes back that you cant go home again
1066542 he jacen hated the universe hated everything about it all the pointless suffering and empty death and all the stupid mindless mechanical useless laws and all the squirming blood smeared ignorant life hated the stony flesh under his feet and the air that he breathed hated himself hated even the hate he felt and suddenly he wasnt tired anymore he wasnt confused anymore everyting was simple everythig was easy everything made sense because hate was everything and everything was hate and he didnt want to die anymore
1066543 call it the universe or the force or existence those are only words they are half truths less they are lies the truth is always greater than the words we use to describe it
1066544 but he knew this life is more a matter of choosing than of knowing he could never know the eventual destination of his path but he could always choose in which direction to take each step
1066545 he remembered that he didnt have to know what he was all he had to do was decide
1066546 he would never really know could never really know much of anything truth is elusive and questions are more useful than answers

1066557 eventually our plans are for the achievement system to become an account based system
1066558 for now the points are just a wow character score as we graduate to that blizzard account system which is right on the horizon it will switch over to a blizzard level
1066559 things like i have a horde and alliance character at maximum level or i have three max level characters

1066575 the reason this logic doesnt follow for many software engineers and software patents is that the stuff that gets patented is sometimes simple and a horrible waste of cycles and time happens globally as people work around the patents
1066576 usability is required on all sites not just the ones that have the resources to patent everything
1066577 so if i come up with a great usability enhancement i should patent it
1066578 hey the goal is actually not to make web sites more usable the goal is to come up with usability enhancements that one or two web sites will use the other sites can go stuff themselves
1066579 is just going to be a directory of patents just swap out any point where there is actual usability advice with the relevant patent number and youre done

1066585 it was hard but great to play against a la liga team it was a great experience

1066591 he was told to come back fitter than he left he was a little bit heavy i think and hes done that
1066592 we have on going negotiations with 3 clubs for players who will definitely add quality to our overall squad it should all be wrapped up by friday
1066593 theo is ahead of what he was doing at this period last season and he is still 19
1066594 i hope theo will be a big part of the squad this season
1066595 i have confidence in him of course but it is down to performances
1066596 his first touch his much better and he moves the ball quicker his penetration and final ball is better
1066597 there is goalscoring potential in him and i hope he gets it out of him

1066601 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
1066602 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country

1066606 the legendary number six shirt is synonymous with bobby and his triumphant and illustrious footballing career
1066607 its retirement signifies deep respect affection and admiration for all that bobby achieved and all that he represented in this marvellous game of ours
1066608 when we were talking about ways to mark 50 years since bobby moores debut there was only one true gesture that would do him justice retiring the number six shirt he made his own
1066609 with the launching of the bobby moore cup and the partnership with the fund in his name as well he will be a part of this club for generations to come
1066610 whenever fans think of west ham united they will think of bobby moore
1066611 it is a fitting tribute to the greatest west ham player ever and the decision to retire the bobby moore number six shirt shows the esteem to which bobby is held at the club
1066612 i first met bobby as a 14 year old being invited into the club during the summer holidays by ron greenwood to join in the pre season training
1066613 i have fond memories of bobby moore as a person because of those times
1066614 he was the sort of person who had time for anybody that was a great part of his personality
1066615 as a 14 year old i had numerous conversations during the six weeks which helped me progress as a young player
1066616 i think its a fitting contribution by the club to retire the number six shirt in tribute to bobby moore
1066617 i am honoured to be the last player to wear the number six
1066618 i will miss it but i am glad that is being retired in honour of such a fantastic player and a true club legend

1066624 the discussions that you are hearing about deferred taxes reflect confusion about budgeting convention versus policy analysis
1066625 while federal budgeting is done on a current basis federal policy analysis is done on a life cycle basis accounting for the life cycle effects of tax changes namely deferred taxes is appropriate in the consideration of tax policy

1066690 la cuarta visi n la vi hermanos veinte d as despu s de la anterior que hab a tenido y era un tipo de la tribulaci n inminente yo andaba por la v a de la campania hacia el campo desde la carretera al lugar adonde iba hay unos diez estadios el terreno es f cil de andar iba solo y rogaba al se or que completara las revelaciones y las visiones que me hab a mostrado por medio de su santa iglesia para que l me fortaleciera a m mismo y diera arrepentimiento a sus siervos que han tropezado para que su nombre grande y glorioso pueda ser glorificado pues me hab a considerado digno de mostrarme sus maravillas y mientras le daba gloria y acci n de gracias me contest como si fuera el sonido de una voz no dudes en tu mente hermas empec a preguntarme y decirme c mo puedo dudar en mi mente siendo as que he sido tan firmemente afianzado por el se or y he visto cosas gloriosas y segu un poco adelante hermanos y he aqu vi una nube de polvo que se levantaba hacia el cielo y empec a decirme es posible que sea ganado que se acerca y levanten una nube de polvo porque estaba a un estadio de distancia cuando la nube de polvo se fue haciendo cada vez mayor sospech que se trataba de algo sobrenatural entonces el sol brill un poco y he aqu vi una gran bestia como un monstruo marino y de su boca sal an langostas de fuego y la bestia ten a unos cien pies de longitud y su cabeza era como si fuera de arcilla y empec a llorar y a rogar al se or que me rescatara de ella y record la palabra que hab a o do no tengas dudas en tu mente hermas as que hermanos habi ndome revestido de la fe del se or y recordado las obras poderosas que l me hab a ense ado cobr nimos y me dirig hacia la bestia ahora bien la bestia se acercaba con tal furia que podr a haber dejado en ruinas una ciudad llegu cerca de ella y aunque el monstruo era enorme se tendi en el suelo y meramente sac la lengua y no se movi en lo m s m nimo hasta que yo hube pasado por su lado y la bestia ten a en su cabeza cuatro colores negro luego color de fuego y sangre luego oro luego blanco as pues una vez hube pasado la bestia y avanzado unos treinta pasos he aqu vino hacia m una virgen ataviada como si saliera de la c mara nupcial toda blanca y con sandalias blancas velada hasta la frente y la cobertura de su cabeza era un turbante y su cabello era blanco sab a por visiones anteriores que era la iglesia y me alegr algo ella me salud y me dijo buenos d as buen hombre yo la salud a mi vez buenos d as se ora ella me contest y me dijo no has encontrado nada yo le dije se ora una bestia enorme que podr a haber destruido pueblos enteros pero por el poder del se or y por su gran misericordia escap de ella t escapaste de ella cieno dijo ella porque pusiste en dios todos tus cuidados y abriste tu coraz n al se or creyendo que puedes ser salvado s lo por medio de su nombre grande y glorioso por tanto el se or envi a su ngel que est sobre las bestias cuyo nombre es segri y le cerr la boca para que no pudiera causarte da o t has escapado de una gran tribulaci n por causa de tu fe y porque aunque viste una bestia tan inmensa no dudaste en tu mente ve pues y declara a los elegidos del se or sus obras poderosas y diles que esta bestia es un tipo de la gran tribulaci n que ha de venir por tanto si os prepar is de antemano y os arrepent s y os volv is al se or de todo coraz n podr is escapar de ella si vuestro coraz n es hecho puro y sin m cula y si durante el resto de los d as de vuestra vida serv s al se or de modo intachable echa tus cuidados sobre el se or y l se har cargo de ellos confiad en el se or hombres de poco nimo porque el puede hacer todas las cosas s puede apanar su ira de vosotros y tambi n enviar sus plagas sobre vosotros los que sois de nimo indeciso ay de aquellos que oyen estas palabras y son desobedientes ser a mejor para ellos que no hubieran nacido le pregunt con respecto a los cuatro colores que la bestia ten a sobre la cabeza entonces ella me contest y me dijo otra vez eres curioso sobre estas cosas s se ora le dije hazme saber qu son estas cosas escucha me dijo el negro es este mundo en el cual viv s y el fuego y el color del fuego y la sangre muestran que este mundo perecer a sangre y fuego y el dorado son los que han escapado de este mundo porque as como el oro es probado por el fuego y es hecho til as tambi n vosotros que habit is en l sois probados los que permanecen y pasan por el fuego ser n purificados por l porque como el oro pierde su escoria as vosotros tambi n vais a desprenderos de toda aflicci n y tribulaci n y ser is purificados y ser is tiles para la edificaci n de la torre pero la parte blanca es la edad venidera en la cual residir n los elegidos de dios porque los elegidos de dios ser n sin mancha y puros para la vida eterna por lo tanto no ceses de hablar a los o dos de los santos ahora ten is el simbolismo tambi n de la tribulaci n que se avecina potente pero si est is dispuestos no ser nada recordad las cosas que han sido escritas de antemano con estas palabras parti y no vi en qu direcci n hab a partido porque se hizo un ruido y me volv atemorizado pensando que la bestia ven a hacia m
1066691 en el apocalipsis de juan de nuevo el orden de los tiempos es mostrado que las almas de los m rtires son ense ados a esperar debajo del altar mientras oran para ser vengados y juzgados ense ados digo a esperar para que el mundo pueda primero tomar las plagas que le esperan de los viales de los ngeles y que la ciudad de la fornicaci n pueda recibir de los diez reyes su perdici n y que la bestia anticristo con su falso profeta pueda pelear contra la iglesia de dios y que luego de echar al demonio al abismo por un tiempo la bendita prerrogativa de la primera resurrecci n pueda ser obtenida de los tronos y de nuevo luego de consignarle al fuego que el juicio de la resurrecci n final y universal pueda ser determinada fuera de los libros puesto que las escrituras indican las etapas de los ltimos tiempos y concentran la cosecha de la esperanza cristiana en el final del mundo
1066692 ahora el privilegio de este favor la resurrecci n espera a aquellos que en la venida del se or son encontrados en la carne y que merecer n debido a la opresi n del tiempo del anticristo muerte instant nea que es cumplida por un cambio s bito para ser calificado y unirse a los santos levantados como escribe a los tesalonisenses
1066693 cuando los tiempos sean cumplidos y los diez cuernos salgan de la bestia en los ltimos tiempos entonces anticristo aparecer entre ellos cuando haga guerra contra los santos y los persiga entonces podremos esperar la manifestaci n del se or desde el cielo
1066694 es propio que tomemos las sagradas escrituras en mano y descubramos de ellas que y de que manera la venida del anticristo es en que ocasi n y a que tiempo el imp o ser revelado y de cual y de que tribu l vendr y cual ser su nombre que est indicado por el n mero en la escritura y como trabajar error entre su gente junt ndolos desde los fines de la tierra y como traer tribulaci n y persecuci n contra los santos y como se glorificar a s mismo como dios y cual ser su final y como la s bita aparici n del se or ser revelada del cielo y cual ser la conflagraci n del mundo y cual ser el glorioso reino de los santos cuando reinen juntos con cristo y cual ser el castigo de los malvados por fuego
1066695 el se or hab a predicho que estas cosas vendr an con la exhortaci n de su palabra instruyendo y ense ando y preparando y fortaleciendo al pueblo de su iglesia para perdurar en las cosas que vienen l predijo y dijo que guerras y hambrunas y terremotos y pestilencias ocurrir an en cada lugar y a menos de que cosas inesperadas y nuevas nos muevan l previamente nos previno que el adversario aumentar a m s y m s en los ltimos tiempos

1066725 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
1066726 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
1066727 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
1066728 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
1066729 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
1066730 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come

1066861 given that were in an unstable economy and an uncertain political landscape its possible that a retro style has come back as a way to connect with our heritage
1066862 even though were in a recession people still want interesting clothing
1066863 theyre looking for more classic styles and subdued tones that will last a few seasons instead of one

1066908 the fence put around schlobohm has forced a lot of guys to basically come out of that confined area into more open space on the palisade avenue corridor and consequently if there is a conflict that exists between rival gangs it makes it a lot easier for people to get at them

1067116 but those who know understand it could easily come back
1067117 if there were to be a major failure in a private equity financed vehicle then for sure there would be political attention
1067118 this industry isnt stupid and is fully aware this is something we need to do
1067119 that is a very dangerous place from which to make policy
1067120 they see the business benefits of doing it there is nothing to fear from transparency and the story they have to tell is generally a good one therefore why not tell it
1067121 i was in the gulf a few weeks ago and the couple of people i spoke to informally indicated they were absolutely willing to go along with what everyone else does
1067122 to remove this from being a political and fiscal issue to more of a factual issue around where private equity sits in relation to the economy the creation of jobs and long term investment the most important thing to is to get some clarity rather than noise around the facts
1067123 i think that is a real long backstop but it is perhaps important to have it
1067124 we do need to understand that companies do go bust from time to time
1067125 but the ability of private equity to manage through and create more value out of these assets when companies get into difficult situations is a big part of what they do
1067126 look at this database column from a table designed in 1973 theres a spare byte in the 4th position that we can use to indicate that this account is our new online web saver supreme account
1067127 ap is the major news source for the thousands of news outlets around the country america who cannot afford to have their own foreign correspondents when ap chooses not to cover something its omission is felt throughout the nation when national news networks and others leave out the same facts the cover up is almost total
1067128 for example a few months ago in a typical ap story on this power struggle
1067129 such omissions by ap and large swaths of the american media leave americans seriously disadvantaged in deciphering what is going on in russia and its profound significance for the world
1067130 you would think it would be hot news when wanted men being hunted by european police suddenly pop up in the us particularly on capitol hill and at events attended by the us president yet there was not a single ap story in the us on any of this not a single national network television or radio news program even mentioned these facts in fact google and lexisnexis searches four days after these events took place turned up only three newspaper articles on them anywhere in the entire country
1067131 prosecutors in russia have been searching the world for a pair of oil tycoons who got on president vladimir putins bad side
1067132 in russia the oligarchs are deeply loathed considered villains who worked to bleed the country dry during their reign many russian citizens saw their life savings disappear overnight
1067133 for years the neocons push for war against iraq was largely uncovered by the us media for even longer the neocons close connections to israel have gone largely unmentioned in mainstream american news reports as a result very few americans know to what degree many of those responsible for the tragic us invasion and occupation of iraq have been motivated by israeli concerns the omission in coverage of iraq has been profoundly disastrous both for the middle east and for americans in fact it is quite likely that only history will show the true extent of this disaster it is deeply troubling to see the same kind of omission occurring on russia
1067134 a world in which human life doesnt have the same value as it does in the west
1067135 morriss blunt soul bearing has lifted the last barrier of propriety to the open expression of raw arab hatred one longs for some gigantic outcry of opposition or disgust over this confession of deep bigotry but there has been none except for a few letters to the editor of haaretz from american jews the interview has aroused little attention in the jewish american community no denunciation no shock little or no discussion on any but the most progressive jewish e mail lists you have to assume that however awkward morriss blunt language may be he is speaking for a large segment of american jews who say they oppose the occupation say they hate sharon say they hate israels oppression of the palestinians but who do nothing about any of these things and who in the end would not grieve either for the palestinians or for the jewish soul if israel wiped the palestinians off the map
1067136 when israel faced defeat before the united armies of egypt and syria sec of state henry kissinger ordered america armaments flown into the israel occupied sinai peninsula giving israel a pivotal advantage against her arab foes the ensuing arab outrage produced the great oil embargo of 1973 sending the u s into a debilitating recession for the better part of a decade
1067137 a clear and present danger to fairness in the canadian tax system
1067138 today taxpayers have been released from state servitude and can begin to provide for themselves and their families
1067139 lessons learned for the next administration on using performance information to improve results
1067140 i am going to give health insurance to 47 million americans who are now without coverage
1067141 theres a salary code and thats what they would change
1067142 were going to have to monitor very closely that people are getting the right salary
1067143 you dont get to keep your salary from last year
1067144 to bounce salaries all over the place to me just doesnt make sense
1067145 this resulted in the use of over 600 000 of operating dollars without appropriate board approval
1067146 they were approved in the overall budget which was approved by the board
1067147 did not have the courtesy of receiving a copy of the audit
1067148 admit her mistakes be contrite about them and attempt to move forward
1067149 instead she seems to be defiant about her mistake and attempts to say that the board was a partner to her mistake
1067150 as these expenditures were approved by the board they were proper and legal
1067151 further as the board was made aware of the nature of the tap program at its inception there can be no excuse that the school board was surprised by the budget amounts
1067152 she did not have legal authority to expedite those expenditures
1067153 it attempts to obfuscate what we already know to be the case there is no doubt that over time we would contribute to the program but accelerating those three elementary schools went over and beyond what the school board would financially contribute in year one and thats the problem
1067154 this whole controversy is being presented to the public as if i tried to intentionally misappropriate funds to the detriment of the teachers and the system
1067155 not one cent of this grant was personally used by me or my administration
1067156 it is not our job to manage the governors agenda
1067157 when we know something has happened and it has to do with malfeasance or misfeasance
1067158 its our job to do what any elected board should do which is to hold the person accountable
1067159 you could instantly have a huge run on public education dollars
1067160 this is an effort to amend the constitution by ambush
1067161 this is not the proper way to deal with our founding document
1067162 reverses legal precedent prohibiting public funding of private school alternatives
1067163 we thought they were both policy issues that had to do with education spending
1067164 uniform efficient safe secure and high quality system of free public schools
1067165 spoken loud and clearly about the value of free public education in the state
1067166 the words we used were carefully considered and selected to create a system that the legislators knew if adopted by the people that it free public schools was the highest duty
1067167 this amendment 9 could potentially damage our public education system in dramatic ways we barely have enough money for it now
1067168 all i want is for our education system to be adaptable to each child
1067169 this ensures the legislature can make new programs that meet every childs need
1067170 if you are contacted directly by the igs office or gao requesting information of any kind please do not respond to questions or make any statements
1067171 the clear intention behind this move is to chill the cubicles by suppressing any uncontrolled information
1067172 there is nothing that restricts conversation between enforcement staff the press gao and the ig and the procedure is consistent with existing agency policies
1067173 no one has to get permission or approval to speak with the ig or gao
1067174 all epa officials and employees are required to cooperate with oig
1067175 this cooperation includes providing the oig full and unrestricted access to epa documents records and personnel
1067176 the epa into a secretive dangerous ally of polluters instead of a leader in the effort to protect the health and safety of the american people
1067177 i hope this e mail is not akin to the wide range of tactics this administration has used to thwart accountability
1067178 its probably one one hundredth of what has to happen to fix the 4 a gallon situation
1067179 you can improve your gas mileage by around 3 3 percent by keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure
1067180 could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
1067181 lower 48 outer continental shelf will increase by about 200 000 barrels per day by contrast the production offset based on obamas proposal will likely approach 800 000 barrels per day immediately
1067182 destroying household name companies by saddling them with massive debts
1067183 how long does a cowboy stay on a bucking bronco a minute and a half its the same deal with private equity owners of companies rodeo capitalism rewards the speculators and punishes decent companies and their workers with uncertainty
1067184 buy it strip it flip it seems to be the motto
1067185 asset strip in pursuit of a quick buck and quick profit
1067186 trade unionists have skipped the debate they have decided they dont like private equity and they are not even interested in discussing whether it brings any benefits to the economy
1067187 trade unions have not historically been concerned about the tax regime per se they have identified this as a potential vulnerability rightly or wrongly yet debt is a legitimate business expense pretty much every company uses it to finance its business
1067188 we all have children do you think wed go home and say we flip we dip we strip
1067189 now he is free of his political responsibilities as a true lord he should ride to the rescue and calm speculation about what he will do with his shares he should issue a statement saying that the sainsbury family is happy with the situation as it is
1067190 people have to wake up to the reality maybe this is the tipping point in the publics acceptance of these deals and the publics understanding of the downside of the private equity business model
1067191 the biggest blunder of all is that this policy announcement has discounted the income trust sector by 30 billion which represents a huge whack of the economic base of canada
1067192 the resulting leverage buyout of the income trust sector will cost ottawa dearly thus putting more pressure on taxes from ordinary canadians
1067193 why wouldnt the department of finance the minister and prime minister understand this
1067194 high profile directors and ceos meanwhile had approached mr flaherty personally to express their concerns many felt they were being pressed into trusts because of their duty to maximize shareholder value despite their misgivings about the structure paul desmarais jr the well connected chairman of power corp of canada even railed against trusts in a conversation with prime minister stephen harper during a trip to mexico and told him he should act quickly to stop the raft of conversions according to sources
1067195 in june of last year ci financial converted to trust status
1067196 we express no opinion as to the impact of the transaction on the solvency or viability of bce or the ability of bce to pay its obligations when they become due
1067197 better business bureaus do not handle complaints outside their local service area which enables them to have more accurate information
1067198 the bbb processed a total of 250 complaints about this company in the last 36 months our standard reporting period of the total of 250 complaints closed in 36 months 107 were closed in the last year
1067199 we knew that there would be an economic slowdown in the united states and we took the steps in terms of making sure we in canada were prepared for this economic slowdown
1067200 you have to either leave it alone or fix it
1067201 we were going to see the two largest telecommunications companies in the country not pay corporate taxes thats a clear and present danger to fairness in the canadian tax system i thought we had to act
1067202 bell expects it will have no significant federal cash taxes through 2010
1067203 based on a an updated review of the companys tax loss position telus now expects minimal cash tax payments in 2007 a preliminary estimate ofapproximately 100 million in 2008 with the payment of significant cash taxes largely deferred to 2009 rather than 2008 as previously anticipated
1067204 and the implications for ottawa are pretty much the same
1067205 financial markets are getting more innovative and you are getting some very low risk businesses that can support more debt and investors are finding ways of having them carry more debt in order to avoid the corporate income tax
1067206 he is a bit like the dutch boy who has his finger in the dyke he plugs one hole but then bingo another hole pops up
1067207 i am not going to talk about anything that is subject to current market activity
1067208 when you are talking about a company becoming an income trust under the old rules you are talking about a company getting a preferred tax rate when you are talking about a corporation continuing as a corporation but under different ownership it is still taxable at the same rate
1067209 the effect of what he is doing is exactly the opposite of what he intended because the holders of income trusts pay lots of tax
1067210 all of these trusts are now being taken over in such a way so that the new owners will pay no tax
1067211 so instead of a situation where a lot of personal taxes were being paid you are having these induced takeovers by highly leveraged private equity companies that will pay no tax
1067212 i wouldnt be surprised if theyre the last to say die theyre the most angry and they probably feel the most betrayed
1067213 i think were going to see a bunch of innovations between now and 2011
1067214 voor de pvda heeft de affaire nekschot red een andere dimensie afgelopen weekeinde kon je al het gemor horen dat vanuit de partij en haar electoraat opsteeg sociaal democraten zijn niet alleen overwegend seculieren die zelf graag de spot met religies drijven maar hebben ook goed ontwikkelde voelsprieten als het om de inperking van de vrijheid van meningsuiting gaat
1067215 als je als geschiedenisleraar over de tweede wereldoorlog praat kun je best eens een uitstapje naar de discriminatie van nu maken
1067216 voor de doorsneekiezer rijmt de naam nekschot toch met uitschot een cartoonist die op grove wijze de spot drijft met fatsoensnormen en religie ook al blijkt de islam zijn geliefde doelwit nekschot laat met sommige van zijn tekeningen geen twijfel bestaan over zijn weerzin voor het christendom in het algemeen en het cda van balkenende in het bijzonder
1067217 ayaan is een echte pvdaer toen zij ons verliet was dat een zwarte dag
1067218 de multicultis van de pvda zijn in moslimse ogen stuurloze sukkels eerder deerniswekkende onnozelaars dan serieuze gesprekspartners
1067219 het komt zoals het gaat binnen de pvda een stap vooruit in electoraal opportunisme twee stappen achteruit in zelfcensuur de sociaal democratie nieuwe stijl enerzijds een onstuimige onderstroom opgestuwd door een aanstormende generatie van vernieuwers en anderzijds een sociaaldemocratische bovenstroom van twijfelzuchtige zelfknevelaars die elke vernieuwingsdrift die zich van onderop aandient angstvallig tracht in te dammen
1067220 wij moslims respecteren de wetten van de ontvangende samenleving zolang ze met geen van de islamtische principes op voet van tegenspraak staan
1067221 ik moet op een dusdanige wijze mijn standpunten verwoorden dat hetgeen ik zeg de westerling als muziek in de oren klinkt terwijl ik er tegelijk op bedacht moet zijn in tune te blijven met het onveranderlijke leergezag zoals door de profeet geopenbaard
1067222 willen we recht doen aan vrouwen of willen we de islam van alle kritiek vrijwaren
1067223 wat begon als een ernstige belemmering is veranderd in een troef de hoofddoek is slechts een uiterlijk symbool waar het om gaat is wat in er in de hoofden onder die doek schuilgaat het doel is om de moslimidentiteit en de islamitische geloofspraktijk te beschermen en uit te bouwen de emancipatie van de vrouw is heus wel te verzoenen met de zuivere beginselen van de islam
1067224 het voortschrijdende ideologische en culturele waarderelativisme zal tot de heerschappij van de islam leiden
1067225 natuurlijk spreken wij hier onze afschuw over uit maar het verzet als zodanig steunen we de moslimbroederschap zal het gebruik van geweld slechts gebruiken in uiterste noodweer bijvoorbeeld wanneer we er cht van overtuigd zijn dat het gebruik van geweld ons in staat stelt het geloof en de eenheid van moslims te bewaren
1067226 degenen die zeggen dat de islamitische jihad louter ter verdediging van het thuisland is minachten de grootsheid van de islamitische manier van leven zij beschouwen dit islamitische totaalconcept minder belangrijk dan hun thuisland dit is niet de islamitische manier van denken en hun opvattingen zijn een substraat van de westerse decadentie die volledig in strijd is met de islamitische moslimidentiteit
1067227 toen ik nog geen hoofddoek droeg werd ik vaak bij de autochtone buren uitgenodigd voor een kopje koffie daarna was het over
1067228 we hadden hirsi ali niet nodig om ons wakker te schudden we waren al wakker
1067229 ze heeft niet de emancipatie op de agenda gezet ze heeft vooral zichzelf op de agenda gezet
1067230 ze beschouwen specifieke islamcellen als de vertegenwoordigers van de permanente revolutie en als zuivere manifestaties van het ware proletariaat
1067231 we willen dat amsterdam de veilige homo hoofdstad blijft we willen dat politieagenten gerespecteerd worden om hun kennis van de wet niet van de koran we tolereren geen pvda politici met een discriminerende of denigrerende houding naar allochtonen homos of vrouwen wij accepteren geen haatzaaien vanuit salafistische moskee n
1067232 we kennen de wijken waar de nieuwe samenleving wordt uitgedokterd
1067233 de actieve tolerantie die ik voorsta betekent dat we discriminatie en achterstand bestrijden ruimte geven aan religies en verschillen verdraagzaamheid betrachten maar tegelijkertijd compromisloos onze verworven vrijheden verdedigen
1067234 het is de grote nieuwe sociale kwestie van de komende decennia
1067235 en omdat wij en niemand anders kapitaal in handen hebben met aboutaleb albayrak marcouch karakus en al die anderen zijn wij de aangewezen partij om de soms draconische veranderingen door te voeren
1067236 vrienden na gisteren weten we het weer de aanhouder wint met teamspirit boek je resultaten kansen kunnen keren dat geldt voor marco dirk en khalid dat geldt voor ons
1067237 denk aan de gewone deugdzame burger die op tv terroristen ziet die zeggen uit naam van de islam te handelen en zich plots afvraagt wat dat zegt over zijn buurman die ook moslim is
1067238 en ik zou mezelf schamen als ik niet zou erkennen elke dag een dag jonger te worden
1067239 het kabinet heeft zich verplicht voor 2011 zon eerste uitvoerbare betekenisvolle en onomkeerbare stap te nemen
1067240 we moeten nu eenmaal niet alles wat de media ons voorschotelt zomaar als zoete koek slikken
1067241 is het klimaat waarbinnen islamdebatten plaatsvinden ook nog eens grondig verziekt omdat door veel moslims en islamlobbyisten op voorhand een ogenschijnlijk onaantastbare claim wordt gelegd op het primaat van een heel exclusieve vorm van slachtofferschap
1067242 als de pvda geen deel van de oplossing is wordt ze deel van het probleem
1067243 het pvda lidmaatschap is vandaag aan de dag een beproeving een zware beproeving ik weet er alles van maar het stemadvies van ger niet op de pvda te stemmen red zou ik niet opvolgen daar zal je niet gelukkig van worden
1067244 wat ayaan hirsi ali wel heeft gedurfd de navelstreng met de pvda eigenhandig doorknippen dat lukt de drie pvda spijtoptanten maar niet alleen maar dreigen met flinkse taal dat je uit de partij zult stappen terstall het is god of ik eruit maar vervolgens gewoon blijven zitten waar je zit maakt het er allemaal niet geloofwaardiger op
1067245 de pvda heeft de plicht leidend te zijn in echte emancipatie zowel in de portomonee als in het hoofd
1067246 is het voor ons in de westerse samenleving nog wel mogelijk vast te houden aan ons moslim zijn
1067247 alle belanghebbenden bij de godsdiensten en ja daar reken ik ook bij al die
1067248 mijn vrouw was mee we spraken een uit turkije of marokko afkomstige mevrouw met hoofddoek die ons vertelde dat ze altijd met veel plezier in de wijk had gewoond maar nu durfde ze niet meer over straat
1067249 het laatste woord is aan de jongens op straat die kunnen we niet meer tegenhouden kijk naar frankrijk
1067250 ik vind de islam als politieke theorie hoe mensen met elkaar moeten samenleven een foute filosofie het is totalitair het is gewelddadig het is vergelijkbaar met het communisme en het nazisme
1067251 heel nederland weet wat de islam vindt van de homo van de ongelovige en van de vrouw
1067252 je moet naar de bevolkingssamenstelling kijken als human resources over tien of twintig jaar zal je de gevolgen zien het is doodeng
1067253 de moslims die graag hun eigen waardestelsel willen zijn aan de winnende hand
1067254 ayaan mag wat mij betreft bescherming krijgen in nederland zolang dat nodig blijkt maar buiten nederland zal ze het zelf moeten oplossen wij moeten buiten s lands grenzen ook alles verder zelf uitzoeken
1067255 de politie zoekt de laatste tijd sowieso veel meer contact met moskee n en maatschappelijke organisaties vooral in amsterdam west
1067256 het grootste deel van de moslimjeugd in nederland krijgt van hun ongeletterde onwetende ouders een traditionele opvoeding die het slechtste van de islam discriminatie tegen vrouwen homoseksuelen athe sten en joden combineert met de tradities uit de onderdrukte en onderontwikkelde gebieden van herkomst de tweede en derde generatie moslims beschouwen dit mengsel van geloof en tradities uit de herkomstlanden van hun ouders waar ze zich natuurlijk nooit zouden willen vestigen als hun identiteit te verkiezen boven de westerse normen en waarden daardoor botsen ze voortdurend met de nederlandse samenleving de nederlandse samenleving moedigt deze eigen identiteit aan door de oprichting van moskee n islamitische stichtingen organisaties en scholen mogelijk te maken en te subsidi ren in feite een anti integratiebeleid de nederlandse overheid heeft niet ingezien dat orthodoxe moslimgeestelijken die links nederland voor hun karretje hebben weten te spannen onmogelijk bondgenoten kunnen zijn in de bevordering van integratie al pretenderen ze dit om maar gesubsidieerd te blijven het is goed te beseffen dat de vertegenwoordigers van de orthodoxe islam de vrije seksuele moraal van het westen als het grootste kwaad op aarde zien de enige manier om de jeugd ertegen te beschermen is het prediken van haat jegens het westen
1067257 laat mij zien wat voor nieuwe dingen mohammed heeft gebracht en jij zult alleen slechte en inhumane dingen vinden zoals dat hij heeft voorgeschreven het geloof dat hij predikte met het zwaard te verspreiden
1067258 de pogingen van de islamapologeten het staats en justitieapparaat te ondermijnen vormen op langere termijn een fundamenteel groter gevaar dan de etnische gewelddadigheden en moslimaanslagen
1067259 de danszaal sidderde op de klanken van de muziek en tevens op het ritme van sensueel met elkaar verstrengelde ledematen
1067260 armen werden om elkanders heup geslagen lippen kusten elkaar de bovenlijven werden innig tegen elkaar aangedrukt en de atmosfeer was zwanger van hartstocht
1067261 het belangrijkste voor deze mensen lijkt het onderhouden van hun tuin daarbij gaan ze te werk zoals een handelaar zijn handel uitvent of zoals een fabrieksdirecteur zijn fabriek draaiende houdt er gaat geen gevoel voor het sierlijke of smaak voor het artistieke schuil in de activiteiten die zij ontplooien het blijkt de ver doorgevoerde graad van mechanisering waarmee de organisatie evenals de onderlinge rangschikking van elke denkbare passie en of esthetische vreugde is beroofd
1067262 overal wordt gelachen en iedereen heeft fun terwijl men elkaar bij elke gelegenheid omhelst en kust maar nimmer kan men echte genegenheid van de gezichten aflezen
1067263 een mogelijke verklaring is dat het huidige engeland een van de meest liberale samenlevingen van europa heeft in het bijzonder onder de jongere generaties in de steden waar de meeste moslims leven wordt meer alcohol gedronken en er op los geleefd is de onthechting van de traditionele familiebanden het grootst en wordt minder een of ander vorm van geloof beleden dan waar ook ter wereld aan de hand van uitspraken door de britse moslims wordt duidelijk dat zich een deel van hun kritiek richt tegen deze seculiere hedonistische anomische levensstijl wanneer vrouwen tot seksobjecten worden gereduceerd zeggen jonge moslimas dan ga ik liever gesluierd door het leven zij huldigen een vorm van conservatief feminisme het is een sociaal conservatieve kritiek t a v veel facetten binnen de britse samenleving die in het bijzonder onder hun generatie aan het licht treden het inzicht dat deze jonge britse moslimas daadwerkelijk de vinger leggen op de zere plekken in onze moderne progressieve liberale seculiere samenleving omdat ze niet in de haak zijn het inzicht dat verstandige mensen uit eigen vrije wil er voor kunnen kiezen op een andere uiterlijk meer ingetogen manier te leven dit komt binnen onze alledaagse progressieve discoursen nauwelijks aan bod hetgeen echter wel het geval zou moeten zijn
1067264 moslimvrouwen zo viel daar te beluisteren kunnen zich uitsluitend dankzij de islamitische wetten ontplooien en geestelijk verrijken wetten die er tevens toe dienen dat zij zich tegen de westerse decadentie kunnen beschermen moslimas zullen hun zelfrespect hun waardigheid hun eerbaarheid hun identiteit en hun zelfstandigheid herwinnen indien zij conform de islamitische wetten leven en het westerse emancipatiemodel afwijzen dat slechts heeft geleid tot de overspeligheid van de vrouw immers binnen de westerse samenleving wordt de vrouw middels de reclame en de porno industrie tot een gebruiksvoorwerp gereduceerd onze sluier daarentegen beschermt ons hij bekrachtigt ons zelfbeeld van moslima ons geloof aan de islam
1067265 wat men een cultuur met een wijdverbreid gebrek aan respect te bieden heeft dan zou men in ogenschouw moeten nemen wat van islamitische waarden te leren valt moslimkinderen hebben in vergelijk met eenoudergezinnen die in groot britanni steeds vaker voorkomen een grotere kans op te groeien binnen de beslotenheid van gezinnen die nog geheel intact zijn
1067266 zo goed binnen de blanke samenleving te zijn ge ntegreerd dat ze haar meest kwalijke eigenschappen overnamen integratie heeft ze niet gered zij heeft deze terroristen juist gekweekt
1067267 weliswaar komt ook in landen als iran libi algerije of zelfs het tamelijk ontsloten egypte prostitutie voor maar deze landen staan niet op het verlanglijstje van westerse sekstoeristen de selectieve verontwaardiging over de gedwongen huwelijken binnen de islamitische cultuur kan ook aan het weerbarstige omgangsverkeer dat het westen met die landen onderhoudt worden toegeschreven
1067268 het afleggen van de sluier opent voor de kolonialisten de tot dan toe vergrendelde horizons en toont hun stuk voor stuk het ontblote algerijnse lichaam met als gevolg dat dit in toenemende mate de agressiviteit opwekt bij de moslimvrouwen die men van de eerbaarheid beroofd door ze van hun sluier te ontdoen
1067269 een schaars geklede vrouw werkt als onbedekt vlees dat katten aantrekt
1067270 twee vliegen in een klap doodslaan de onderdrukker en de onderdrukte tegelijkertijd uit de weg ruimen wat rest is een dode man en een vrije man
1067271 het meest verneukeratieve van dit alles is dat zich op die manier een specifieke vorm van het feminisme opdringt dat zegt jullie hoeven alleen maar zo te worden zoals wij en dan zijn jullie gelukkig
1067272 waarom konden meisjes en vrouwen voor de revolutie zonder problemen vrijelijk gebruik maken van allerhande openbare vervoersmiddelen waarom hebben zij sinds de revolutie zulke problemen waardoor ze zelfs niet eens door de afgedwongen scheiding der seksen bijvoorbeeld in de bussen beschermd kunnen worden vrouwen willen niet gezien worden als lustobject maar de islamitische republiek heeft ze hier wel toe gedegradeerd vrouwen vormen overal het doelwit van huid en haar verslindende blikken
1067273 doe de hoofddoek af leef in het hier en nu
1067274 moslimas leer de vrijheid van het individu lief te hebben
1067275 was geen makkelijke beslissing omdat ik daarmee een zelfbeeld had ontwikkeld dat met zedelijke waarden verknoopt was omdat ik iemand ben die geen half werk levert heeft het mij twee jaren van onderzoek en experimenteren gekost alvorens ik mij er van kon losmaken mijn leven zonder hoofddoek is niet zozeer beter geworden want het was in feite altijd al goed maar het is in wezen heel anders spannender en veelzijdiger geworden
1067276 het is een strijd tussen vrijheid en onderdrukking tussen democratie en dictatuur het is een strijd tussen mensenrechten en de schending ervan het is een strijd tussen degenen die vrouwen behandelen als dieren en degenen die ze beschouwen als menselijke wezens
1067277 wandelend met mijn haren wapperend in de wind voelde ik mij op de een of ander manier groter
1067278 het schema dat in de perzische brieven is opgesteld kan echter ook tot een valkuil worden
1067279 wat is de jahili maatschappij en op welke manieren biedt de islam haar het hoofd
1067280 zeker mag degene die de islam aan de mensen presenteert niet iemand zijn die zich met een concept manier of traditie van de jahiliyyah inlaat hoe groot de druk daarvan op ons ook moge zijn
1067281 at joey amp eddies excess is the norm but is the food really that good how do you judge by what we like today or by what we hold up as the ideal from the past how much should manzare adapt the recipes for todays lighter more complex tastes
1067282 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
1067283 the commissioners office has been informed of a deal involving the pirates red sox and marlins the commissioner has to sign off on any deal involving cash considerations of more than a million dollars and there was clearly going to be cash involved in any deal involving these teams theres also some formality about manny ramirez waiving his 10 and 5 rights and no trade clause and ill admit not understanding the technicalities marlins get manny ramirez one prospect red sox and cash likely covering ramirezs remaining salary pirates get jeremy hermida and three prospects two marlins one red sox red sox get jason bay and john grabow
1067284 we just traded two of our best players for four guys i never heard of how could we do this
1067285 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
1067286 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
1067287 no expert in child development would advocate for subjecting children as young as 10 to this level of violence yet the study shows that such exposure is commonplace in this country
1067288 we should re think the current movie rating system which has been in place for 40 years and was designed when kids could only see movies in theaters ratings need to be more prominent on all movies whether they are seen in theaters or purchased in the store and we need clearer messages to parents pediatricians and child advocates should instruct parents to strictly abide by the movie age guidelines and to closely monitor movie viewing
1067289 the goal of the assessment should guide the choice of the assessment tools used and assessments that will have widespread effects should meet high standards of rigor and validity
1067290 for example using a standardized test with a sample of children in a program would be suitable if the goal was to determine whether the program is bringing children closer to national norms but if the purpose is to guide instruction within a specific classroom a nonstandardized assessment linked to the curriculum would be appropriate

1067293 the number of instability events per decade is always several times higher when the population was declining then when it was increasing
1067294 the connection between population dynamics and instability is indirect mediated by the long term effects of population growth on social structures

1067405 naar verwachting zal de komst van de moslimgeleerde leiden tot grote ook internationale belangstelling voor de islamstudie in leiden en voor het debat over de islam in nederland
1067406 de sultan bemoeit zich niet met de invulling van de leerstoel
1067407 terwijl er binnen de main stream media en dientengevolge ook binnen het publieke debat een semantische woordenstrijd woedt over nut en zin van het islamisme voor de westerse cultuur wordt binnen steeds meer europese universiteiten en vanuit speciaal daarvoor beklede leerstoelen het meer welbewuste bedrog onderwezen over de geestelijke ideologische en cultuurverrijkende betekenis van het corpus islamicus
1067408 dankzij de buitengewoon welwillende medewerking van wat hij noemde wijze bestuurders vakbekwame politici en weldenkende journalisten is te verwachten dat nederland als islamitisch missieland tot voorbeeld zal strekken voor veel andere westerse landen hij liet zich ontvallen dat nederland door arabische regeringen wordt gezien als het ideale gidsland van waaruit de islamitische missie d w z het streven naar een de wereld omspannende ummah zonder noemenswaardig verzet kan worden uitgedragen
1067409 het is een criminele groep en een die heel slim is
1067410 partly its a way of recording constantly trying to mix things so they are constantly louder and continuing to do that until its as loud as possible
1067411 lo fi what does that even mean that has so many different connotations i mean for the bands where we come from lo fi equals a type of sound with us its more like diy where you record it yourself we might have been different if we had older people teach us how to use garageband music making software or if we went to music school or something
1067412 thats like fucking math how can that be fun twisting nobs and not playing instruments fuck that man
1067413 yeah then instead of calling the album rip it off wed have to call it sample it up or something
1067414 bradfords like us he knows where were coming from hes a country boy
1067415 i mean we started out in art school trying not to be a rock band and then we realised we could write and play songs
1067416 i think thats where a lot of the ideas came from i mean all the things in art weve done we see that in all the music we liked
1067417 you know the reproduction of something else you know i think the whole idea of print making and stuff like that reproduction it all feeds in
1067418 i think most of the art that we like the bauhaus stuff and dada its about taking a concept and making it a part of your life
1067419 turn it off man hey thats what this album should be called turn it off
1067420 it just sounds fucking cool dont you think it sounds cool
1067421 it was also meant to be a multi faceted title nowadays if theres anything you want you can rip it off the internet
1067422 for the new generation or whatever i think the idea of plagiarism has lost its negative connotation like if you look through the 40s 50s and up through the 80s everythings already been done so you might hear a song and you might wanna play a song like that well then you learn the chords and you rip it off but what you add to it is your own time and place
1067423 plus everyone is like oh they sound like the early 90s so yeah that too
1067424 ja sorry zat op het werk dus was nogal druk

1067435 full responsibility for the first world war lies squarely on the shoulders of the international jewish bankers they are responsible for millions of dead and dying
1067436 the bolshevik revolution in russia was the work of jewish planning and jewish dissatisfaction our plan is to have a new world order what worked so wonderfully in russia is going to become reality for the whole world
1067437 the international jewish bankers rule the world through debt which is money they create out of nothing they need world government to ensure no country defaults or tries to overthrow them as long as private bankers instead of governments create money the human race is doomed these bankers and their allies have bought everything and everyone
1067438 the federal reserve banks are one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever seen there is not a man within the sound of my voice who does not know that this nation is run by the international jewish bankers
1067439 we are on the verge of a global transformation all we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the new world order
1067440 the transportation department of the wake county public school system is committed to the safe transportation of students to and from schools every day
1067441 the fact that the recent unacceptable student transportation incidents occurred despite the focus on student safety and continuous reinforcement of practices and procedures has triggered the need to again review those practices and procedures

1067448 volstrekt verwerpelijk dat moeten we bestrijden dat gezegd hebbende moeten we er vanuit gaan dat we dit soort extremen in onze samenleving nu eenmaal hebben
1067449 the first of the baby boomers are just barely over 60 now so over the next 10 or 15 years youll see a real increase in that group
1067450 lower housing prices could have some impact because historically florida has been a relatively low cost place to live but that has been going up in recent years
1067451 florida is going to face a very different racial and cultural gap as the older boomers age and the younger immigrants come with competing demands on public services
1067452 a lot of baby boomers will expect social services to be there for them and that wont be the case because funding hasnt kept pace with the need or demand
1067453 floridas destiny and its demographics are on a definite collision course unless we have the fortitude to invest in those essential services that will sustain a growing older population
1067454 these baby boomers are thinking more about coming here and theyre realizing now is the time
1067455 the prices are so much lower right now we got our house for 100 000 less than what is was going for a year ago
1067456 i think people got run out of town by the high prices and now that prices and rents are coming down well see more people
1067457 im just waiting for the house thats a good bang for the buck that i can make an offer on

1067479 i was just happy to make the final with the likes of phillipa rachel and paige
1067480 i never ever expected to win but to win this competition is definitely the best result of my career to date
1067481 the standard of surfing in the girls divisions is so awesome all the girls rip
1067482 this win gives me so much confidence i cant wait for the australian titles
1067483 he is one of the best surfers in california and lots of people say he is closest to win this event i was only lucky
1067484 so i moved alot and looked for the wave to score big and i found it this is my 3rd time in japan and the people are so nice and the food is so good i love japan i try my best to keep the momentum and hope to win the event
1067485 the waves were very small and we had to have extra care with wave ion i am very happy to get good waves and make the quarter finals
1067486 dustin was so strong in the semi final he is so strong in small waves and deserves to win i could only catch only 1 wave and there was nothing i can do
1067487 een verschil in welvaart op zichzelf levert geen grond op voor het verlenen van asiel maar ook omdat dit met dergelijke grote groepen fysiek onmogelijk voor ons is ik heb daarbij het gevoel dat wij het over de uitgangspunten van ons beleid betrekkelijk aardig eens zijn rechtvaardig waar het gaat om op het opnemen van politieke vluchtelingen streng waar het gaat om anderen
1067488 wie rechtvaardig in zijn beleid wil zijn moet streng zijn in de uitvoering daarvan vreemdelingendetentie behoort samen met de uitzetting tot het noodzakelijke sluitstuk van ons asielbeleid want wie niet bereid is uit te zetten zet ons stelsel op scherp
1067489 zelfs als wij het gevoel hebben dat wij nieuwkomers niet naar onze eigen menselijke maat opvangen dan nog kan die maat er een zijn die voor nieuwkomers vanuit hun perspectief aantrekkelijk is
1067490 waarom trek je niet in twijfel of dat wel moet waarom geldt het recht op awbz voor alle ingezetenen dus ook meteen voor alle immigranten moeten we de basis niet gewoon veranderen moet die niet strenger en selectiever worden gedefinieerd
1067491 dat het idee om migranten pas na verloop van tijd dezelfde rechten te geven tot nu toe niet is uitgevoerd is aan de justitiemaffia te wijten ministers constateren altijd maar weer dat als ze iets willen veranderen het niet mag van justitie omdat er een wet of een verdrag in de weg zit
1067492 als wij er niet in slagen om ons op zichzelf juiste beleid strikt om niet te zeggen restrictief en streng uit te voeren dan is het op den duur doodeenvoudig door de macht van het getal onmogelijk om dat beleid in stand te houden ik denk dat dit de enige manier is om ons beleid beheersbaar te houden

1067496 some insurers can make a decision in the same day or right on the spot
1067497 ik vind het ontzettend jammer dat het zo moet je manifesteren als datgene wat je juist n et bent het is een soort omgekeerde coming out beweging toch wel erg als dat je identiteit moet zijn
1067498 het is goed dat mensen die met sociale uitsluiting of erger worden bedreigd steun zoeken bij elkaar heel logisch anderzijds vind ik hun uitingen erg fel en denk ik soms dat het wel eens een onsje minder kan geen enkele religieuze gemeenschap ziet haar aanhangers graag vertrekken zo hebben ook jehovas getuigen er veel moeite mee hun volgelingen te laten gaan

1067501 er is hier een volk uit egypte aangekomen dat het hele land in beslag neemt ze hebben hun kamp tegenover ons opgeslagen kom alstublieft hierheen en vervloek hen voor ons zodat wij hen uit ons land kunnen verdrijven want ze zijn ons te onverbiddelijk u staat erom bekend dat uw zegen

1067506 ik denk ook dat het op dat ogenblik een uitstekende deal was laten we ons goed realiseren dat we toen al jazeker ook toen al jarenlang bezig waren geweest en dan met name ook het stadsdeel met dat rivaterrein en nou lag er eindelijk een plan wat een keer de verslagen moeten lezen van wat er in die tijd in de stadsdeelraad is gezegd ieder een vond het onder de gegeven omstandigheden ook prachtig dat eh die moskee daar kwam en de enige manier om dit te realiseren was op deze manier
1067507 ja hoor eens eh we hebben dus niks daar geen gift gegeven of niet gesubsidieerd
1067508 ja dat zijn we zoals we dat ook wel met kerken hebben gedaan
1067509 nou ja als er nou sprake is van het grotere belang dat het hele terrein nou eindelijk eens tot ontwikkeling kan komen moeten we ons daar dan aan houden mag ik u in herinnering roepen dat dit een plan was wat ook de bouw van een heleboel woningen behelsde woningen die we daar allemaal graag wilden hebben dan vind ik de afweging die wij hebben gemaakt om niet per definitie aan de scheiding tussen kerk en staat vast te houden volstrekt acceptabel
1067510 ja hoor eens dat mag zo wezen maar niettemin de voorbeelden zijn er ik ken ze niet uit mijn hoofd maar neem van mij aan ze zijn er nogmaals laten we het zuiver houden immers waar gaat het bij de scheiding van kerk en staat om juist ja dat is de je niet in elkanders bevoegdheden treedt ik zie er dus op zichzelf geen kwaad in
1067511 nou ja dat klopt het was zegt u terecht de portefeuille van toenmalig wethouder duco stadig pvda wat daar precies ook al weer de reden van was weet ik niet laten we het erop houden dat ik het fijne ervan vergeten ben en ook al was ik erbij ik kan mij de reden waarom we deze deal voor de raad hebben verzwegen domweg niet meer herinneren
1067512 dat is enkel maanden geleden inmiddels wel gebeurd en ik denk dat dit goed was geweest om de raad hier destijds over te informeren achteraf bezien had je dat wel kunnen doen ja
1067513 nou ja god excuses je kunt daar achteraf altijd weer van alles over zeggen weet u laat dat debat morgen maar plaatsvinden wat bij mij centraal op het netvlies staat is dat ik mezelf nog heel goed herinner waarom wij indertijd met de risicos die we daarmee ook voor ogen zagen toch hebben gezegd dat dit plan inclusief die deal en de manier waarop we dat hebben opgepakt er hoe dan ook doorgedrukt moest worden
1067514 nou nee daar gaat het hier helemaal niet over immers het was een buitengewone bevoegdheid van het college en besef wel als de totstandkoming van deze deal iets was geweest wat de gemeenteraad had moeten besluiten dan geef ik u op een briefje dat het anders had uitgepakt kortom ik herhaal dit valt gewoon onder de bevoegdheid van het college
1067515 ik ben het vergeten ik moet u het antwoord op de vraag waarom dit destijds niet aan de raad is verteld simpelweg schuldig blijven ik heb nog een keer geprobeerd om bij mij zelf ook nog een keer te achterhalen waarom het vertrouwelijk was en nog veel belangrijker waarom het vervolgens niet aan de raad is vermeld maar hoor eens ik weet het gewoon niet
1067516 een probleem met de islam dan zeg je nogal wat
1067517 even back in the old days there was a screening process for people who work in those laboratories
1067518 there are time honored procedures to examine security clearances on a regular basis to verify information provided by the security clearance holder and traditional steps to ensure that only the appropriate level of security access is granted largely based on the nature of the persons government job
1067519 you must be kidding me this country really needs a new president this country is so messed up

1067529 hipihi from the beginning was meant to be a global platform it differs from 2 d and 15 of our customers come from overseas
1067530 children who experience hostility abuse physical discipline and other aggressive behaviors by their parents are more likely to model that behavior in their peer relationships
1067531 children learn from their parents how to behave and interact with others
1067532 so if theyre learning about aggression and angry words at home they will tend to use these behaviors as coping mechanisms when they interact with their peers
1067533 has served as one of the primary contributors to its persistence and severity

1067539 het voortrekken van allochtonen kan nuttig zijn steeds meer mensen roepen om positieve discriminatie ook ik ben voor positieve discriminatie
1067540 soms voel ik mij bij de pvda ergert zich aan de manier waarop kamerleden van de pvda net doen alsof ze niets te maken hadden met de bemoeienis van terstall
1067541 zoals wolfsen die zegt dat er geen richtlijnen waren eddy is door d e mensen getipt ze trekken hun handen af van de hete ketel ik ben niet gediend van dit soort spelletjes
1067542 soms voel ik mij bij de pvda als een neger in de ku klux klan en op andere momenten een halve stasi
1067543 het gesprek met partijgenoten van allochtone afkomst onder wie kamerlid bouchibti en de amsterdamse stadsdeelvoorzitter marcouch ging er onder meer om hoe de pvda
1067544 het is wel heel raar als mijn eigen familie de pvda er niet bij zou staan
1067545 vogelaar was nog geen 24 uur minister toen ze al zwaar inzette op het thema boerka verbod geen probleem vond ze vanzelfsprekend gaat wilders dan subiet zoeken in zijn fles en heeft de pvda die zo vurig gewenste profilering van zijn minister al in de zak zoals het een ideologiserende minister betaamt wil vogelaar ook een debat over de positie van de islam in nederland om wilders de wind uit de zeilen te nemen
1067546 als ik iets stevigs zeg over de islam reageren allerlei gematigde moslims als door een wesp gestoken wanneer ik hun dan probeer uit te leggen dat ik h n niet bedoel wordt ik weer van de andere kant aangevallen omdat ze me dan weer te soft vinden zo zit ik als sociaaldemocratische voorman tussen twee vuren de sharia en het socialisme oude stijl
1067547 besef jij dat jouw boodschap gevaarlijk is weet je dat een nederlander theo van gogh weliswaar geen moslim het leven heeft gelaten
1067548 je weet dat ayaan hirsi ali de profeet mohammed een perverse tiran heeft genoemd zeg jij haar dat na
1067549 is het risico dat jij met deze beslissing neemt jou de moeite waard en kunnen we nu van jou een kruistocht tegen de islam verwachten
1067550 rekening dient te houden met het feit dat voor een deel van de pvda achterban principes aangaande deze materie zoals in grondwet en partijprogramma nog niet vanzelfsprekend zijn
1067551 zich uitsluitend aan feiten te houden en de kwalificaties aan de toehoorder te laten achterlijk
1067552 vrijheid van godsdienst is belangrijker dan respect voor dwingelandij van de islam sommige passages binnen de koran zijn dermate achterlijk en in strijd met de universele rechten van de mens dat ik daar totaal geen eerbied voor kan opbrengen
1067553 tachtig jaar spaanse bezetting heeft ons land nochtans niet doen knielen voor de inquisitie maar het heeft nog geen drie decennia geduurd of een groot deel van de vaderlandse pers en politiek buigt verachtelijk diep voor de achterlijkheid van de islam
1067554 over 20 jaar bestaat de bevolking van amsterdam voor meer dan 60 uit zogenoemde allochtonen d w z moslims daar moeten we ons vooral druk om maken
1067555 wanneer bloed aan hun handen kleeft en zij nochtans hun handen in onschuld wassen dan is het alsof ze zich in het slijk der aarde wentelen met de bedoeling zichzelf ervan te verschonen
1067556 als er gerommeld is met geld dan was dat door het vorige bestuur en wie werkte daar altijd dolgraag mee samen precies burgemeester cohen

1067592 we are all nintendo warriors today remember that game that electronic game a few years ago push buttons zim zam boom and it was all over with that is not the way you fight war although we as a society have grown to believe that
1067593 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
1067594 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
1067595 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
1067596 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back
1067597 im prepared to bid for that first ticket to shoot a wolf myself

1067614 such a dangerous and unwelcoming atmosphere that immigrants and their families leave the united states because they have no other choice
1067615 fanning the flames of intolerance xenophobia and at times bigotry
1067616 such a national policy is doomed to fail because it underestimates the human spirit the spirit of hope that we celebrate in this gathering
1067617 while we are bound to respect our laws and not violate them we also are bound to correct unjust laws
1067618 the terms rule of law and national security should no longer be used to justify the harsh and inhumane treatment of immigrants refugees or asylum seekers while we acknowledge the right and the need for our government to enforce the law we must remind our fellow americans that man made law does not permit the violation of gods law

1067632 theres only one side a lack of judgment on my part thats really all i have to say
1067633 i have no excuse all i have is the opportunity to gain the respect of my fans to gain the respect of my family gain the respect of my co workers and gain the respect of the organization
1067634 im a fallen man im a man that made a mistake

1067636 the good thing is that we were both man enough to come face to face and talk without any other kind of altercations
1067637 sometimes when emotions are involved you do stupid things for me being a christian i have a forgiving heart and im willing to move forward to help this team win this year
1067638 we still have some more things to talk about as far as what can we do to be able to go out there and coexist on the same field same team and be productive and help this team win this year
1067639 only two men can do that and feel like we have what it takes in order to do so
1067640 i played 20 years ago in seoul when baseball was a demonstration sport i had a great time then
1067641 this will be great because i started my career with the olympics and i feel like this would a great end for it
1067642 ive had five elbow surgeries so its obviously not a new elbow anymore
1067643 but its definitely good enough for one last kick at the can here at the olympics i had seven years in the big leagues and i feel very blessed to have played that long
1067644 this is pretty cool to be able to say i went to the olympics as well
1067645 when i decided to hang them up from professional baseball i was driving home and i wasnt even thinking about the olympics
1067646 then when greg hamilton baseball canadas director of national teams called to ask if i was interested i couldnt resist
1067647 i was actually built up to throw five six seven innings by now
1067648 but i had to take some time off after the injury it set me back a lot and now ill be a one or two inning guy again my body wouldnt allow me to do more
1067649 my whole focus was to get my arm in shape
1067650 i know i can pitch im only a year away from being out of the big leagues my whole thing when i talked to greg was to get my innings where i could get my arm strong and keep it there and i feel its where it was before
1067651 it was great actually more than i thought it was going to end up being
1067652 it was a great experience im glad i did it i got a chance to see a lot of people that i probably hadnt seen in 20 some years plus the fans got a chance to see me live pitching instead of watching me on tv
1067653 and it was a good way to give back to the community to the kids and try to encourage them to keep following their dreams and to never give up
1067654 if opportunities do arise after the olympics i would consider it
1067655 at the same time im really content with where my career has ended up but the door is always open i feel like i still have something left in me
1067656 i played 20 years ago in seoul when baseball was a demonstration sport i had a great time then
1067657 this will be great because i started my career with the olympics and i feel like this would a great end for it
1067658 ive had five elbow surgeries so its obviously not a new elbow anymore
1067659 but its definitely good enough for one last kick at the can here at the olympics i had seven years in the big leagues and i feel very blessed to have played that long
1067660 this is pretty cool to be able to say i went to the olympics as well
1067661 when i decided to hang them up from professional baseball i was driving home and i wasnt even thinking about the olympics

1067692 kiefer and i after the writers strike were sort of riffing a bit about some of the africa story that had been discarded
1067693 we went down to south africa for i think three days and the rest of it would be simi valley pretending to be south africa we told them it would be a really difficult shoot and they accepted it right away and said do the whole thing there it all turned out pretty exciting for us
1067694 when we went to africa we went with one of the best scripts weve ever had thank you howard gordon for that we didnt have to rush it like we normally do and it kind of set a precedent for the rest of the season for how we were going to approach it there is nothing in my twenty two years of experience like going on location to help you bridge to reality that young boy is one of the finest actors ive ever worked with
1067695 its allowed us to really flesh out the stories in a way weve never been able to its allowed us the freedom and creativity to really make season seven much deeper
1067696 ive become an alcoholic since i started writing this show its just been absolutely amazing for me
1067697 first off i got to work with my brother which is really cool i jumped in the middle of the season and brannon said there is nothing that can prepare you so now i am just happy and i sort of see my self as the other carlos
1067698 i have to basically write the show for them its not easy
1067699 no its been amazing really since the very first day of the show its been this amazing mixture of people we know that when this is done its never going to happen again i think its been my most fun year
1067700 this is the fourth time he has died but you know we love this character i do credit manny and david fury for insisting almeda was not dead they had an idea to bring him back last year and you know we didnt like how he died we just were not happy with that death
1067701 i think one of the most difficult thing for the course of the show has been working with phenomenal actors who eventually depart
1067702 i have to tell you the stuff we did in africa for this prequel is right up there i am an optimist for the future so i am going to say we have not made my favorite episode yet
1067703 im going to say my favorite episode is in this season
1067704 were not trying to reinvent the show every year we take what you all have told us what you like through the internet through fan mail and fan phone calls we try every year to take out what you dont like put in what you do like for the writers its an unbelievable challenge
1067705 i think one of the coolest things about season seven that i am really excited about is for the most part hes trying to be better and i think thats something that i really loved about the character
1067706 theres a real growth to each character youre following along on that path for me it was very organic it felt very natural to me
1067707 the first season i shot with carlos i got to shoot at him and tackle him so i loved it
1067708 we got really lucky with the prop and special effects guys that we work with we have a lot of people on our crew that come out of the feature world a lot of the gadgets they obviously dont exist and those guys make them and with regards to the guns all of the guns are real they have a small metal piece down the barrel that allow you to shoot a real round with the powder taken out of it
1067709 the fact that we deal with torture and the consequences of it i think thats what makes it worthwhile drama we are not endorsing drama but we explore it
1067710 i think this is the first time where weve put children in danger
1067711 okay okay i get it there were other times we put children in danger it makes for good drama
1067712 i shot a scene where jack baurer is going to raid an office and ran into a washroom in the lobby and came out nine seconds later a lot happier but they cut it out assume whenever they cut to the white house jack is in the bathroom and not only that but hes getting something to drink and something to eat

1067756 obama refers to big oil and the need to reduce our use of oil by 35 over the next twenty years how do we get there keep inflating those tires folks
1067757 it seems to me the only thing obama wants us to do is inflate tires

1067789 in 2004 there were all sorts of media reports that sex workers were coming from all over the country to new york city because there were going to be so many potential customers during the republican national convention

1067795 it may be a somewhat dubious honor but for the second year in a row the world bank said liberia had shown the greatest year to year improvement among the nations on its list of corrupt countries

1067797 by strengthening liberias infrastructure security and capacity liberia will be better able to attract the investment it needs to build a thriving economy that will create jobs and opportunity for the liberian people

1067811 it is concerning that many people dont understand what inflation is or how it might affect decisions about saving or spending money
1067812 inflation means that prices increase over time so 100 today will buy you a little bit less in a years time it can be caused by increases in salaries increased demand for items or a decrease in supply which all push prices up
1067813 people are more likely to think about how inflation affects the price of their shopping basket but not how it affects the value of their savings the rpi is one of the measures of inflation and with it averaging 3 98 last year if we dont put our savings in a tax free account matching or a non tax free account beating this rate then our money will be worth less in the future

1067834 the results of the esg lab validation offer further proof that emulex cnas reduce data center complexity and lower operational costs with a unified fabric
1067835 the emulex lp21000 family of cnas leverages eight generations of field proven fibre channel technology allowing companies to extend their fibre channel investments while deploying a next generation unified fabric in their data centers under a common management platform in short the lightpulse family of cnas delivers all the functionality that our oem partners rely on and expect from an industry leader like emulex
1067836 recent research conducted by esg indicates that data growth risk mitigation complexity cost and performance are the top concerns of todays enterprises
1067837 fcoe addresses many of these issues and our testing confirmed that emulex cnas easily drop into existing data center environments using the same qualified and proven drivers management tools and techniques that emulexs fibre channel hbas have used for over ten years
1067838 reduced network complexity esg found that because emulex cnas share a common driver stack field proven hbanyware management tools and n port id virtualization npiv support customers will see a reduction in network complexity and total cost of ownership as well as overall data center consolidation benefits

1067858 it was scary the window was smashed and there were leaves all through the house
1067859 i went to sign into the accounts and they said the password had been changed
1067860 i had an idea who had done it but i dont know exactly how they did it
1067861 it was quite a big deal to me i lost all my e mails and quite a lot of private stuff on the bebo page
1067862 if it happens to anyone they should let the police know so things can be done about it and people will be aware there are consequences
1067863 i think its quite common and people wont know who did it i know a few people who have had it happen
1067864 the increase in alcohol related deaths for females and the decline for males across the two periods may result from several factors including the introduction of alcopops first sold in australia in 1995 which particularly target females
1067865 i think if we started to gather appropriate data in new zealand we would find the trend is no different an increasing amount of alcohol is being consumed by young women and that trend is led by alcopops
1067866 there is a major problem out there with young girls drinking alcohol
1067867 they dont realise that they are at far higher risk of alcohol related harm socially emotionally physically they can get themselves in all sorts of trouble
1067868 it doesnt surprise me the mortality rate would be going up
1067869 you only have to look at the emergency department and the problems theyre having with drinking theyve had a gutsful of drunks getting in the way of doing real work
1067870 young women are drinking to excess and then being taken advantage of sexually
1067871 when theyre advertising rtds they put the strength in there
1067872 why do they do that they dont do that with beer its because teenagers are very price sensitive and want to know how drunk they can get for their 20

1067877 this is his life his injuries were very bad and he is still forgetting things he has gone backwards in his school work he gets tired
1067878 i was in hospital for six weeks and in a coma and had three or four operations
1067879 i didnt think he was going to come back to us
1067880 i kept praying i kept praying that we would get him back
1067881 now ive got my grandson back its his second life
1067882 it gives everybody a chance to compete and thats what everybody wants
1067883 if you havent had the best season theres a light at the end of the season to salvage your season
1067884 how do we get them into the building on tuesday
1067885 we usually sell them in packets thats our challenge to put people in the stands on tuesday to create an environment
1067886 there are a lot of potential negatives but so what we cant be afraid of games
1067887 all we heard was how strong the missouri valley was how we were lucky to be in the conversation with creighton and southern illinois
1067888 i dont think were in that situation at providence there are some doubters i know but the people around here the administration everyone they want a strong academic college and successful athletic programs hopefully i can benefit from being in the right place at the right time
1067889 these guys are very open and excited about their senior year
1067890 sometimes with players it takes until their senior years for them to understand how to motivate themselves thats what i have now we have seniors but they dont think anything is guaranteed no one feels like its their turn they want to work and they want to win a j price return to form
1067891 everyone in this league has great players if you have a great recruiting class so does everyone else that just puts you on a level playing field what you have to do is have back to back classes and let them grow together and develop its very hard to win with freshmen in this league even carmelo anthony was surrounded by great players
1067892 eleventh place 10th place that could be a very good year for us
1067893 believe me no one wants to accelerate the process more than a coach i would love to turn things around overnight but in this conference its impossible
1067894 because its an election year the government is trying to make sure the statistics look really good
1067895 youre dealing probably with the most disengaged group or in north canterbury with young men who have got really good job opportunities and can earn really good money and they dont see the reason for staying at school
1067896 the thing that i cant understand is the double standard its against the law to have marijuana and yet schools are expected to do something other than what the law dictates
1067897 there has to be a line in the sand for things like drugs because of the safety of students
1067898 schools need to ensure that their policies are flexible and reflect the needs of the situation
1067899 it is important that student support needs are assessed on a case by case basis to ensure actions are appropriate to the circumstances and take into account the background of the student not just the incident at issue
1067900 if you go and say that those kids cannot leave school and then you dont fund alternative programmes principals like me effectively have to invent programmes and staff them and do that out of an existing budget and thats virtually impossible to do
1067901 every principal you talk to will have stories to tell you of kids who should not be at school who when they come to school cause merry hell and because they dont meet the absurdly high criteria for early leaving exemptions they cant get one
1067902 they almost invariably are behavioural issues in some cases you get a kid who just cant cope in school and therefore they get bored to tears and the behaviour starts to disrupt
1067903 theres no doubt about it that the ministry as agents of the government want to have the rates as low as possible its a good news story for them if they have lower rates
1067904 its a farce really its made a nonsense of things
1067905 in days gone by if somebody was involved in smoking marijuana at school the schools zero tolerance to that would have ended up with that kid being kicked out of school
1067906 what do you do when a student decides to assault another student and this is the third time
1067907 we havent really had an example of blocking patterns for a year or so because of the la nina el nino also tends to encourage mobility and lots and lots of westerly winds but at the moment we have neither
1067908 with blocking it continues until it wants to break down and theres no real way of forecasting how long it may last it will go when it wants to go
1067909 my house has been here over 100 years there has been no movement so we dont feel unsafe at all
1067910 i was quite shocked to see it i didnt expect the whole wall to come down
1067911 its obviously taken a lot of backyard of that house away
1067912 this suggests that the deceased may have been alive somewhere in the south wairarapa in or about 1742
1067913 we know the deceased was possibly a european female and likely aged between 40 and 45 years
1067914 weve been kind of sheltered independent and out of the cameras eye
1067915 then back in the cameras eye one last time its kind of nice
1067916 its such a rare event just incredible to have quintuplets survive and do well
1067917 i can remember as if it were yesterday being in the delivery room
1067918 im speechless i was the one who wasnt supposed to make it but god had different plans so im standing here 25 years later
1067919 to hear them tell it i was very bossy and the mother hen to them
1067920 she does not want to see that man none of us want to see his face in a courtroom to be fair and she wants to be spared having to give evidence at the trial that could be months down the track
1067921 we will have to see how the next few weeks go and how she is but at this stage she is not that keen about going back to it you wouldnt be would you
1067922 shes pretty traumatised as you can imagine i heard shes been beaten up quite severely
1067923 some of our girls go out and get professional photographs done they look like models
1067924 i am running for the state senate because it is a golden opportunity to make progress toward the goals we all care about public schools access to health care and ethics reform
1067925 having the support of the texas afl cio is going to go a long way toward bringing my brand of reform to the texas senate ive always enjoyed their support in the past and am extremely proud to have their backing in this campaign
1067926 my goal since the early days was to play with ritchie blackmore a dream that materialized after many many years of trying really hard to get in touch with the man with him i did lots of tours worldwide and participated in some of his recordings and videos while i was in ritchies band i recorded my first solo album a mostly classical cd called ostinato using nothing but bass guitars on compositions by bach mozart chopin and some of my own you can listen and download it from in 2001 i joined yngwie malmsteens rising force toured around the world and participated on the 2003 g 3 tour with yngwie joe satriani and steve vai
1067927 the album features k k downing from judas priest and yngwie malmsteen on two guitar solos each k k also was the executive producer on the cd and roy z did the final mix
1067928 we performed in europe on the same bill with motley crue and danny vaughn and preparations are on the works to tour south america europe and the us towards the end of 2008 and through 2009
1067929 these are top of the line basses that have been around for a very long time as far as i am concerned they are the most comfortable best sounding and coolest looking basses in the world
1067930 the euro 4lx comes with emg p j active pick ups gold plated hardware with spector brass zinc alloy locking bridge schaller tuners and straplocks cant get much better than that
1067931 then i had a fender jazz bass i was in love with that bass but in time i grew a bit bored of it i had put a pick guard with the uk flag before i joined ritchie blackmores renaissance band so he asked me to use an alvarez acoustic bass instead because mine looked too rock amp roll adding that they didnt have those in the fifteen hundreds needless to say in the 1500s they didnt have electronic drums either
1067932 semi acoustic telecasters with guitar synths electronic keyboards and other instruments used in renaissance
1067933 but i guess it was crucial that the bass didnt look too rock amp roll so i went and got a couple of warwick basses which even though they were woody looking still looked too rock amp roll for you know who
1067934 after a while i spotted the spector booth at a namm show in la went there tried them out and that was it i found the bass i was looking for
1067935 i have been using gallien krueger bass amps for the longest time currently i use the 1001 rb ii model which provides me with all the power i need and more its 700 watts are plenty to use multiple cabinets and fill any venue with plenty of big bottom
1067936 for cabinets i use gallien kruegers 8 10 blxs and or 4 10blxs or rbhs depending of the size of the venue in the past ive used ampegs acoustics and even marshalls both amps and cabinets but i prefer gk over all of them
1067937 once youre past the beginning level if youre contemplating having a professional sound to be noticed and be ahead of the competition it is essential to invest in proper equipment
1067938 gk has some great combos like the backline 210 or 115 for relatively small venues they may cost a bit more than the cheaper brands out there but you know youll have a very reliable product that you can count on for a very long time
1067939 i use a whammy by digitech especially for certain bass solos or bass lines that require a more intricate sound i also use a diesel dawg and a gallien krueger distortion pedal for bass for more aggressive loud and explosive bass solos
1067940 i am also becoming reacquainted with some bass pedals and effects made by rocktron they were lost soon after i got them a couple of years ago and they recently reappeared and they are great they are the black cat a wah wah with a moan effect a digital bass preamp for the stage and studio and a midi foot controller ive just began experimenting with these last two but it looks like ill have plenty of use for them pretty soon for live performances and for violent storms next studio album
1067941 no woman should have to do that in the middle of winter
1067942 its risky is it going to take someone losing their life or the life of their baby before they do something about it its not going to be my baby and hopefully it wont be anyone elses
1067943 our first response in travel is for the woman to be given the option of getting to christchurch by their own methods usually driving and if that is not possible to investigate other ways of transporting her
1067944 my contractions were five to 10 minutes apart there is no way i could drive myself

1067956 it is a magical place and it holds many memories for me
1067957 we are taking a longer term approach with fighters because the issues are rather broad for example most tanks hold aggro through dps and specialized buffs instead of using their taunts at the same time taunts have gone up linearly but damage has gone up in a more exponential matter to make taunts a more primary role of holding aggro is going to take some time then there are other issues like survivability and defined tanking roles we are kicking around a lot of ideas and concepts but like i have said tank balancing is more of a long term project to do it right we could band aid things and improve certain classes but that wouldnt really get to the deeper issues of fighters which is what we are really trying to fix here

1067971 seeking an order rejecting the empire state development corporations esdc findings and determination to seize their homes and businesses by eminent domain
1067972 new york courts have a proud history of interpreting the new york constitution as providing greater protections for individual rights than the federal constitution we are confident that the court will see this for what it is government officials bending to the will of bruce ratner allowing him to wield the power of eminent domain for his personal financial benefit
1067973 esdcs claims of public benefit are a pretext to justify a private taking
1067974 the public process was a sham the outcome was predetermined in a back room deal between ratner pataki and bloomberg

1067977 campaign contributions from oil industry executives to sen john mccain rose dramatically in the last half of june after the senator from arizona made a high profile split with environmentalists and reversed his opposition to the federal ban on offshore drilling
1067978 the centerpiece of sen mccains plan to stimulate the economy actually the whole plan is large tax cuts for corporations it would deliver 3 8 billion in tax cuts to the five largest american oil companies according to an analysis released today by the center for american progress action fund
1067979 republican sen john mccain criticized sen barack obamas c all for a windfall profits tax on the oil industry on tuesday despite leaving the door open to the same idea last month mccain criticized obama his democratic rival repeatedly in excerpts of a speech planned for delivery tuesday evening he cited obamas advocacy of a tax on excess oil industry profits as well as the democrats vote for president bushs energy legislation in 2005 mccain reserved his sharpest words for the windfall profits tax if that plan sounds familiar its because that was president carters big idea too im all for recycling but its better applied to paper and plastic than to the failed policies of the 1970s mccain said in the excerpts
1067980 would deliver a 3 8 billion tax cut to the five largest american oil companies

1067988 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense

1068041 the two big ones we apple couldnt close but i think youll see those later this year
1068042 apple inc s iphones will go on sale in russia next year vedomosti reported citing evgeny butman a moscow based director of apple imc apples official vendor in the country
1068043 no single carrier will have exclusive rights to iphones service contracts according to vedomossti
1068044 apple declined to comment to vedomosti about 470 000 iphones are already operable in russia after the handsets were hacked to work on unauthorized networks the newspaper said citing moscow based mobile research group
1068045 unique coating that protects critical operational equipment against damage and loss of function caused by exposure to weather and moisture it is ideal for applications in the electronic industry
1068046 there are a lot more complicated issues than just copyright or trademark there are more complex issues than those in respect to the end user licensing agreement and antitrust issues come into play too
1068047 take a look at the web site of the lead attorney representing apple
1068048 gilliland was on the townsend team that successfully collected more than 1 1 billion from microsoft corp in a class action antitrust lawsuit after the software and operating system developer settled before that case went to trial in early 2003
1068049 they came to us i think because this is a much bigger issue than just copyright
1068050 theres the fact that we are in the jurisdiction of the u s district court for northern california but weve also tangled with apple before weve dealt with apple so were familiar with the courts and the parties and we have an antitrust background
1068051 what psystar might say is what we would like to do is use the mac operating systems unique features more broadly on a variety of hardware i think its a very very hard argument to make but i wouldnt be surprised if they tried my guess is that they will mount some kind of direct attack on apples exclusive licensing
1068052 apple pulled the app yesterday without giving my any notification that they were doing it or what their justification was for removing it ive tried to contact them about the issue but its been a complete dead end if anyone has a useful contact number for apple please let me know im in regular contact with all my data providers and none of them have had an issue with my app indeed the response was the exact opposite they like my app and have even asked if i would do custom application work for them in the future furthermore all the data i use is licensed by the owners as free for non commercial use i e precisely what boxoffice is so im stuck here not knowing what has happened or what i can do about it if any of you have any ideas please let me know you can respond here but id actually appreciate a reply at cyrusn stwing upenn edu since i probably wont check back here that often
1068053 if someone spends a lot more money on food than the average person or if they spend a lot more on medical care then their own personal inflation rate will be different
1068054 with transportation prices today increasing at a much faster pace than overall inflation if you spend more on transportation than the average consumer your inflation rate will be higher
1068055 what people spend their money on varies substantially by age income region and ethnicity
1068056 i live relatively close to campus and there are three or four days a week that i ride my bike to work gas can go up and it doesnt make much difference in my budget i fill up my gas tank twice a month and some people fill up their gas tank twice a week
1068057 feel that the cpi is currently understating the inflation that they are struggling with since the prices for things they buy almost every day like gasoline and bread are rising rapidly
1068058 in most times the cpi is a good benchmark for the inflation most of us face in times such as now however it is clearly less useful
1068059 in most times prices across most goods and services rise at similar rates
1068060 today prices are rising rapidly for energy and food compared to prices for everything else so that for those households that spend more of their budget on energy and food the overall cpi is not representative of the inflation they face
1068061 when you have rapidly rising prices in certain key commodities does that weighting in your basket of goods get changed fast enough so that it really reflects the true cost
1068062 the cpi is a good measure to get an overall sense of where we are and its the best measure we have

1068181 and now behold because ye have tried the experiment and planted the seed and it swelleth and sprouteth and beginneth to grow ye must needs know that the seed is good
1068182 is your knowledge perfect yea your knowledge is perfect in that thing and your faith is dormant
1068183 this because you know for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls
1068184 if ye will awake and arouse your faculties even to an experiment upon my words and exercise a particle of faith
1068185 and now behold because ye have tried the experiment and planted the seed
1068186 for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good
1068187 behold i say unto you nay neither must ye lay aside your faith
1068188 in verse 33 is particularly intriguing perhaps the best place for thinking about the role of faith is precisely in this gap or is it
1068189 neither must ye lay aside your faith for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good
1068190 we shall know of a surety then we shall believe
1068191 now as i said concerning faith that it was not a perfect knowledge even so it is with my words ye cannot know of their surety at first unto perfection any more than faith is a perfect knowledge
1068192 and now behold are ye sure that this is a good seed i say unto you yea for every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness
1068193 ye will say i know that this is a good seed for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow
1068194 then you must needs say that the seed is good
1068195 lets hang out at the pub and talk about spiritual things
1068196 look if you want to have perfect knowledge well you can have it in that thing along the way since you seem to be so keen on it but lets get quite clear about the fact that its just a kind of bonus while youre doing the actual work of faith
1068197 yea it will strengthen your faith for ye will say i know that this is a good seed
1068198 pry open a gap between the growth or swelling more accurately of the seed and the increase in faith
1068199 for ye will say i know that this is a good seed

1068209 it must needs be that this is a good seed

1068235 for travelers to america from europe or asia american prices are dramatically lower than at home a hotel room or dinner in new york seems a bargain when compared to prices in london paris or tokyo
1068236 and shoppers from abroad are loading up on a wide range of products before heading home but despite this very tangible evidence it would be wrong to conclude that american goods are now so cheap at the existing exchange rate that the dollar must rise from its current level
1068237 it is their unwillingness to do so at the existing exchange rate that causes the dollar to fall relative to other currencies
1068238 the dollar lowers the value of the dollar securities in foreign portfolios when valued in euros or other home currencies shrinking the share of dollars in investors portfolios
1068239 the weaker dollar also reduces the risk of future dollar decline because it means that the dollar has to fall less in the future to shift the trade balance to a sustainable level

1068269 dear children do not let anyone lead you astray he who does what is right is righteous just as he is righteous he who does what is sinful is of the devil because the devil has been sinning from the beginning the reason the son of god appeared was to destroy the devils work no one who is born of god will continue to sin because gods seed remains in him he cannot go on sinning because he has been born of god this is how we know who the children of god are and who the children of the devil are anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of god nor is anyone who does not love his brother

1068277 the ministry of human resources must do more capacity building programmes to enable companies to reach such requirements as are now being imposed by mncs
1068278 big brands no longer care whether you comply with local laws or not because these mncs have their own codes of conduct which you have to agree to in order to be their contract supplier
1068279 if you dont agree to their code of conduct youll simply lose your contract its as simple as that if this goes on malaysia is going to lose billions of ringgit from the loss of clientele

1068287 during the last several years that gasoline prices posted at pumps were steadily rising i have run across a few obscure articles mostly produced by economists which claimed that the actual price of gasoline is now lower than it was back in the 1970s when we had the nuisance of all those long lines at gas stations i am no expert at this stuff but i have noticed something that seems to lend credence to the economists claim there are innumerable huge suvs minvans and similar gas guzzlers still all over the road in my neighborhood and wherever i have been doing some driving florida washington dc maryland alabama georgia louisiana and south and north carolina while the posted prices are of course huge compared to what they used to be it appears from what these economists tell us that the actual percetage of peoples income spent on gasoline is less now than it used to be some thirty years ago and given how many folks are hanging on to their gas guzzlers it looks like the economists are right

1068313 the library may be the single institution that best represents south africas open society no matter what form they take libraries have become indispensable to the advancement of south africas people and to the development of their democracy south africas libraries are also helping to preserve and provide access to the countrys rich cultural and intellectual patrimony
1068314 south africa is redefining the very concept of municipal libraries in response to the day to day needs of the people
1068315 todays community libraries emphasize the basic aspirations of the vast majority of south africans and help to meet those needs
1068316 south africans can now look to the national library as an institution committed to protecting and preserving the rich national heritage of all south africans since 1994 following centuries of colonialism and apartheid officials at the national library have rededicated the system to focus on cataloguing and preserving literature artifacts and other materials relating to the history of the nations entire population in each of the countrys 11 official languages
1068317 the new national library offers nourishment to the countrys citizenry by providing access to south africas national heritage its record of triumphs and failures and the rich lode of south africas intellectual scientific and artistic achievements
1068318 south africas public libraries contain the nations collective memory they are not repositories of human endeavor alone they are instruments of civilization that provide tools for learning understanding and progress
1068319 the national library must lead the way in revitalizing libraries in south africa because libraries are essential to the nations socioeconomic development our view is that the more people read the more they become enlightened the more employable they are and the more jobs they can create
1068320 created a serious obstacle to the publics ability to gather information about key environmental issues
1068321 it doesnt always work someone has had to carry handicapped children up the stairs
1068322 its tough to keep putting band aids on problems its throwing good money away because you cant fix whats wrong with it
1068323 this has been such a wonderful thing because weve waited so long
1068324 when times are the way they are in this state its so refreshing
1068325 overall without this foundation im not sure what the status of our computers would be here
1068326 this program allows us to provide more technology resources for our patrons
1068327 serving communities with high concentrations of poverty that are at risk of having outdated technology
1068328 a circulating library in a town is as an evergreen tree of diabolical knowledge it blossoms through the year
1068329 in today s economy it is critical that people have equal access to the information and knowledge that are available online
1068330 nearly all public libraries in the united states provide this access as many struggle to keep pace with advancing technology and rapidly increasing community demand for these services
1068331 our budget is tight and we really need things we re not able to get now
1068332 weve done fundraisers intend to do more were trying to come up with more ideas like basket bingo
1068333 it was our understanding that it is not an outright gift
1068334 it s matching grant funds and we re not able to do that financially we did the paperwork and went over it but don t think it s possible we re open to ideas and suggestions
1068335 the library has got a lot of new books on a regular basis through donations
1068336 we just updated our computers made it so the kids can come in with their memory sticks save their information and make homework easier
1068337 we have a wii at home but we dont have this one
1068338 weve wanted to buy a wii for the longest time they love it theyre very excited
1068339 we come to this library a couple of times a month
1068340 we finally have the facility to do these things and do them well
1068341 the friends of the library have a long term commitment to help us
1068342 we spent less than 2 000 on the wii project
1068343 a lot of that is because were pumping more money to branch and member libraries especially for childrens programs
1068344 we get a lot more mileage out of childrens programs
1068345 its a beautiful summer night and all these people are here
1068346 theres plenty of demand in 2007 i was personally responsible for 48 programs systemwide most of which were at toms river in 2008 ive already put together 33 programs
1068347 everybody who attends has been really grateful and weve received some really great compliments
1068348 people say they cant believe this is the ocean county library its becoming a well known venue for all sorts of events
1068349 when the economic situation is poor people tend to come to the library
1068350 one of the things that has become really popular is the childrens programs in the summertime
1068351 reading programs are really what made us have a really big jump for july and august
1068352 we have a big tourist population in the summer if it is a nice beach day were not as crowded
1068353 a lot of people on vacation may not have a computer so theyre here checking e mail all day long we have students from eastern europe and elsewhere outside the united states who work in restaurants and other businesses in beach haven they all check their e mail
1068354 with no video store in town people who want a movie come to the library
1068355 were just like the ocean county library just on a smaller scale
1068356 this is my most favorite place aside from the beach
1068357 we all complain about our tax dollars but when i come in here im so happy i pay for this
1068358 my part in this was really just to be a shoulder to cry on
1068359 right now we are on target to break our circulation record
1068360 as i look around this library i see that it is well done
1068361 this building has been transformed into a state of the art information center
1068362 to help start strengthen or expand programs that serve residents who may encounter difficulty using traditional library services due to challenges such as age disabilities or language
1068363 spanish is in great demand especially in lakewood i would say that the materials there are used on a daily basis
1068364 the ocean county library is a truly multicultural institution we respect honor and celebrate all cultures and our collections reflect this commitment
1068365 our staff strives to welcome all cultures to make this possible we offer them training in cultural awareness and basic and conversational spanish we want to make the library the focal point of the community
1068366 a week doesnt go by that were not taking somebody over to that section
1068367 the spanish and chinese area is popular because there are a lot of bilingual kids in the area or just coming over
1068368 theyre mostly spanish but we do have a few french materials
1068369 it is pretty good but i wish they would let you stay on longer
1068370 a lot of people have been coming here to use the internet whether to check their e mail do job searches or anything else
1068371 it was hard to get them off and the staff had to intervene
1068372 i guess during the winter months theres nothing to do
1068373 we like it it brings more people to the library
1068374 theyve added collections added software and hardware upgraded the skills of their staff a lot of institutions have had to change in the internet age but libraries still have a very robust and large constituency
1068375 what were getting better at is trying to make the public aware of what is available
1068376 if you havent been in your local public library since you were in school you have to go back and visit because theres a lot more there
1068377 in the summer you come here and you cant find a parking place in the main library i am amazed at how full the parking lot is when i come in at lunchtime
1068378 you should be able to walk into any library and find internet service
1068379 we provide on our web site links to recommended home pages about certain subjects we also have internet mediated services
1068380 if youre having trouble finding something on the internet or you need to get information you get a live chat session with a trained librarian who helps you find what youre looking for
1068381 i dont know how many times someone has said to one of our staff members
1068382 the usage of wireless especially after we put in a cafe has increased
1068383 and now that we have a brand new quiet study area people come in all day and bring their computers and study its fantastic
1068384 when i walk through the library i see a lot of laptops flipped open people browsing instant messaging e mailing what have you
1068385 there have been plenty of studies that show people who may not be able to afford a computer at home fully understand the library is the place to go to get internet access
1068386 in a world in which internet access is increasingly important for all sorts of things from getting a drivers license to preparing a homework project or looking for a job this is becoming a vital lifeline for the least advantaged segment of the population
1068387 although the cut is not insignificant its not something we cant cope with
1068388 we knew it was coming so weve adjusted our budget accordingly i know that the library is important to mayor john mccormac and to the people of woodbridge and we have their support
1068389 weve been trying to increase our services without increasing the cost but things change you cant predict more than a couple years out
1068390 weve had to trim back and we really try very hard not to affect services when we do that
1068391 part of whats nice about working in a library in a small community is youre forced to be creative you dont have endless funds but its a challenge to see how far you can make the funds go
1068392 we dont have that rush of schoolchildren coming in to study after school but there are more people coming in for leisure reading
1068393 this time of year people want a lighter read usually fiction mystery suspense or romance
1068394 they have a very wide range of books to choose from
1068395 we often come here for the playground and childrens section
1068396 we definitely have people who come in for the a c
1068397 were trying to make it more user friendly for our patrons
1068398 the expansion of the hours is part of a larger scale attempt to make ourselves more accessible and more convenient to use
1068399 were going to be open and were going to serve the public as we always have
1068400 at this point i dont think any employees are dissatisfied we all worked together to solve the problem
1068401 we put a great deal of time and effort into looking to maximize the resources that were given to us
1068402 thats where i go to get my quiet and peaceful time
1068403 especially if you want to make education a priority how can you do away with your libraries
1068404 global access depends on the internet and for a lot of people this is where they get it
1068405 if were going to cut the budget lets cut the budget in some other area where its not going to hurt the people in that way
1068406 an investment that will pay bigger dividends in the future
1068407 it would be absolutely unacceptable for them to be closed permanently

1068419 were issuing more and more cards each month to people who havent had them before
1068420 its my guess the cost of gas and the economy and all are attributing to that we see a lot of people in here every day with their kids in the summer
1068421 im seeing the increase in all of our branches not just here
1068422 this data confirms what librarians have seen from experience that in times of economic difficulties people turn to their libraries and librarians
1068423 were seeing more people coming in for community oriented programs
1068424 its a very busy year for us and of course we like to be busy
1068425 before they were reluctant to sign up because they were away on vacations or shore trips so theyre around a little bit more
1068426 with the computers the kids are here all day long using them looking for web sites
1068427 a lot of them use it to listen to the music we have available here
1068428 its not what youve been given its what you do with what youve got

1068434 the beatport perry farrell customer appreciation afterparty was shut down by the city of chicago
1068435 the city claimed the party had become too well known by the public changing the status from an invite only private industry event to a public event
1068436 our representing council worked extremely hard to get this ban on the event reversed but as it was the weekend we were not able to connect with the appropriate members of the city
1068437 beatport perry deadmau5 and all of the hard working staff are just as let down as you are
1068438 some pictures attached show the level of production we had waiting to go for what would have been a mind blowing event

1068442 as a country deeply invested in the global economic system china would benefit from playing an increasingly proactive role in global economic decision making
1068443 and yet it seems to be doing the opposite in the doha round of international trade negotiations
1068444 its insistence on protecting its own industrial development is driving other countries to do the same and has been a major factor in the growing anti globalization and protectionist sentiment around the world
1068445 chinas foreign investment regulations are opaque and increasingly restrictive and the government continues to grant major subsidies to key domestic industrial sectors
1068446 heavy lobbying by local authorities and by profitable and powerful chinese businesses is shaping beijings industrial policy
1068447 in a way that has led to a significant appreciation of the yuan and forestalled dangerous protectionist legislation
1068448 theres a feeling were still in a bear market its kind of take cover today
1068449 the credit crunch continues to bite and even for some of the more successful financial institutions it continues to take its toll
1068450 the bond market is taking its cue partly from what is happening in equities and also there is just a general realization that this downturn in economic growth has spread to other countries
1068451 the pullback in oil helped but when you strip away the backdrop were still faced with an anemic economy and tepid profits and im not sure theres a real compelling story to jump on the equity bandwagon

1068455 seasteading homesteading on the high seas is an idea that has long attracted libertarians along with others who would like to see a little more competition between forms of social organization the idea is to get out into international waters and set up a floating outpost or 12 or 1 200 from which people can come and go experimenting with different types of legal social and contractual arrangements

1068465 the goal of having no meca team members present was to prevent them from being asked any questions that could reveal information before nasa is ready to make an announcement sources say
1068466 the bush administrations presidential science advisors office however has been briefed on the new information that nasa hopes to release as early as mid august
1068467 not true meca results have not been discussed at the white house
1068468 there is no one who knows either on the phoenix project in tucson or at nasa hq who knows where this information came from
1068469 they had nothing new to report the story was about water ice
1068470 note the aviation week story said very very clearly three times or so no life on mars detected and phoenix can not detect life in the first place
1068471 we are attempting to assess the chemicals and minerals that make up the soil composition
1068472 we are now about half way through the process and there are several conflicting points of view this is not a good time to go public with half the story
1068473 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks

1068475 or dont you know that all of us who were baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death we were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father we too may live a new life
1068476 why he wasnt saying i wasnt from bankhead when he was doing the laffy taffy
1068477 its a shame when we have all these economic problems that the same people who cant afford to pay for their homes are willing to dash to the newsstands and feed the frenzy that causes magazine editors to spend millions
1068478 its a reflection of the appetite for seeing the children of celebs and also our big interest in judging other mothers
1068479 its part of the reason we all like celebrities we can always be less of an idiot than these people
1068480 we are delighted that all proceeds from these stunning images will once again be donated entirely to charity through the jolie pitt foundation
1068481 its either the biggest photo victory ever or the biggest black eye on the journalism business you could imagine and i view it as the latter
1068482 its embarrassing it puts people in a position where everyone who works with them in the future will expect a lot of money
1068483 i used to say its a gamble but now i think its a sure bet they will make it all back maybe not in a specific issue but in free publicity and promotion from the articles even negative ones that will be written about them
1068484 anyone who thinks that will stop the stalkerazzi theyre wrong it didnt work in the old days and it doesnt work now no matter how much money is out there
1068485 in our business there are almost no rules so the fact that the stars are turning the business on its head is probably a natural progression
1068486 the women who read our blog especially the new mothers they feel a connection to these celebrities as if they were family members so theres a natural inclination to want to see the baby pictures of someone you care about
1068487 if a practice is wrong it doesnt matter what the consequences are
1068488 sharing baby photos with family and friends is one thing but having these images put on magazines and on the internet forever is a different story
1068489 we are disappointed that we have not yet received a response from iran
1068490 we agreed in the absence of a clear positive response from iran that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1068491 the incentives package contained everything iran needed to pursue a modern civil nuclear power program which irans leaders claim is their aim the pressure on iran to comply with the demands of the international community and its u n security council obligations will only grow

1068495 israeli authorities halted the process however as they received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
1068496 there was a lot of shouting and pushing people fell down and could not get up they just suffocated
1068497 the police did not allow people to step back meanwhile people started coming down from above shouting go back go back
1068498 since the police did not allow the people to go back this tragedy happened
1068499 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle

1068501 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
1068502 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
1068503 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
1068504 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
1068505 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
1068506 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
1068507 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
1068508 more than 80 percent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive this is usually from the lowest order or the edge of the pool
1068509 this really suggests the need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risk of diving related injuries
1068510 theres a lot that can be done to make diving a safer recreational activity or sport
1068511 having a lifeguard or other supervision present is really important
1068512 what is most interesting to me as a pediatrician with a mind for prevention is what may also be among the most predictable findings of the study that diving injury peaks substantially during the summer months and that boys are far more likely to be injured than girls
1068513 the summer month exposure will surprise no one males are more affected by nearly all types of injury particularly unintentional injury
1068514 we tend to teach children well to stay in the shallow end when they are small
1068515 we do less of a good job teaching about the risks of diving or marking dive safe zones as they grow
1068516 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry
1068517 the continuing strength in the retail businesses in the developing markets
1068518 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world
1068519 the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
1068520 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
1068521 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
1068522 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
1068523 it is difficult to protect a species if you dont know it exists
1068524 in contrast to the 4 7 billion movie tickets sold in america in 1947 there were only 1 57 billion tickets sold in 2003
1068525 organics would be the home run or the grand slam of the mission

1068528 phoenix isnt the last gasp or msl isnt the last gasp
1068529 we dont know the answer and i dont even know how to put odds on
1068530 the fact that 56 000 americans each year are contracting hiv for the first time is a wake up call for all of us in the u s
1068531 these numbers are a scathing indictment of how profoundly u s and cdc hiv prevention efforts have failed
1068532 identifying all those who are infected and linking them to treatment is the only way to break the chain of new infections and begin to address the nations runaway epidemic
1068533 every year more than 15 000 people are dying from this disease and aids is a major killer for some of our minority communities
1068534 the key thing we have to focus on now is what how and when do we begin to enhance the prevention responses to end this epidemic
1068535 to keep the good of the patient as the highest priority
1068536 its kinda crazy because im going to be one of the first guamanians to tour around with someone big like that but its cool hopefully hes a real chill person
1068537 our public sector customers share the enormous responsibility of protecting sensitive information while simultaneously ensuring its availability as dictated by freedom of information requirements said john w
1068538 these government visionary award recipients have successfully implemented symantec solutions to meet these dual requirements while lowering the total cost of ownership of their information systems they can serve not only as role models for other government agencies but also for the business sector
1068539 this critical expansion of our network access control capabilities allows customers to centrally enforce endpoint compliance policies for both managed and unmanaged endpoints through integration with symantec endpoint protection and guest users
1068540 with symantec network access control we have taken a flexible approach that goes beyond host based enforcement and offers customers an array of options for enforcing network access control on the network

1068546 es ist klar dass der iran gespr chen keine aufmerksamkeit schenkt und das ist eine klare botschaft an die internationale gemeinschaft mit wirklichen und effektiven sanktionen fortzufahren und offensichtlich ist der iran eine bedrohung nicht nur f r israel dies ist eine globale bedrohung und die internationale gemeinschaft sollte dementsprechend handeln
1068547 w hrend wir reden macht der iran weiter jede form von verz gerung von seiten der internationalen gemeinschaft wird von den iranern als schw che ausgelegt der iran ist eine bedrohung auch f r seine nachbarn und die internationale gemeinschaft wird nicht nur vom iran beobachtet sondern auch von seinen nachbarn und wenn die internationale gemeinschaft z gerlichkeit an den tag legt wird dies als schw che aufgefasst und wir leben in einer gegend in der man den tyrannen entweder schl gt oder sich ihm anschlie t und ich m chte nicht dass die nachbarn des iran die zum lager der gem igten geh ren sich dem iran anschlie en also ist das was wir heute tun essentiell und wir sollten nicht auf das warten was wir als point of no return bezeichnen
1068548 sanktionen k nnen effektiv sein solange die iraner und der rest der welt verstehen dass alle optionen auf dem tisch sind das ist es was wir heute brauchen wir k nnen es nicht aufschieben wir k nnen nicht darauf warten dass die iraner sich entscheiden ob sie zu gespr chen mit der internationalen gemeinschaft bereit sind und die botschaft von seiten der iraner ist klar sanktionen sind jetzt und heute notwendig

1068595 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church

1068606 the silence of the african union in the face of this is something i would like to learn more about
1068607 it is a very loud silence of acceptance of these unacceptable matters as we are well into the fifth year of atrocities that have been called genocide
1068608 there is no political peace process for the region to speak of
1068609 the people of darfur are strongly supportive of holding those responsible for genocide and crimes against humanity accountable

1068614 after reading an abnormal psychology text book it was determined by my mother and father that my personality significantly deviated from the average and so they suggested i see a therapist

1068634 he doesnt like to kiss me anymore or touch me or make love to me or have dinner with me or watch tv with me only thing he likes to do with me is read the kabbalah but he doesnt even like discussing it with me hmm wow thats the first time i said that out loud it doesnt sound too good does it i didnt mean for any of this to come out im so sorry i should go uhm will you send us a bill or

1068641 the heating unit went out on my dryer the gentleman that fixes things around the house for us told us that he wanted to show us something and he went over to the dryer and pulled out the lint filter it was clean i always clean the lint from the filter after every load clothes he told us that he wanted to show us something he took the filter over to the sink and ran hot water over it the lint filter is made of a mesh material im sure you know what your dryers lint filter looks like well the hot water just sat on top of the mesh it didnt go through it at all he told us that dryer sheets cause a film over that mesh thats what burns out the heating unit you cant see the film but its there its what is in the dryer sheets to make your clothes soft and static free that nice fragrance too you know how they can feel waxy when you take them out of the box well this stuff builds up on your clothes and on your lint screen this is also what causes dryer units to potentially burn your house down with it he said the best way to keep your dryer working for a very long time and to keep your electric bill lower is to take that filter out and wash it with hot soapy water and an old toothbrush or other brush at least every six months he said that makes the life of the dryer at least twice as long how about that learn something new everyday i certainly didnt know dryer sheets would do that note i went to my dryer and tested my screen by running water on it the water ran through a little bit but mostly collected all the water in the mesh screen i washed it with warm soapy water and a nylon brush and i had it done in 30 seconds then when i rinsed it the water ran right thru the screen there wasnt any puddling at all that repairman knew what he was talking about

1068649 i told you and you do not believe the works that i do in my fathers name they bear witness of me
1068650 this was a positive identification of himself for the shepherd of the sheep was to be the messiah and the messiah was to be the shepherd of the sheep
1068651 but you do not believe because you are not of my sheep as i said to you
1068652 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me
1068653 and i give them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall anyone snatch them out of my hand
1068654 my father who has given them to me is greater than all and no one is able to snatch them out of my fathers hand
1068655 they are as alike as two peas in a pod
1068656 many good works i have shown you from my father for which of those works do you stone me
1068657 for a good work we do not stone you but for blasphemy and because you being a man make yourself god
1068658 if he called them gods to whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken
1068659 do you say of him whom the father sanctified and sent into the world you are blaspheming because i said i am the son of god
1068660 if i do not do the works of my father do not believe me
1068661 but if i do though you do not believe me believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him

1068668 doctrine is not an affair of the tongue but of the life is not apprehended by the intellect and memory merely like other branches of learning but is received only when it possesses the whole soul and finds its seat and habitation in the inmost recesses of the heart but it must be transfused into the breast and pass into the conduct and so transform us into itself as not to prove unfruitful

1068679 woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture
1068680 you have scattered my flock driven them away and not attended to them behold i will attend to you for the evil of your doings
1068681 but i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries where i have driven them and bring them back to their folds and they shall be fruitful and increase
1068682 i will set up shepherds over them who will feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed nor shall they be lacking
1068683 that i will raise to david a branch of righteousness a king shall reign and prosper and execute judgment and righteousness in the earth in his days judah will be saved and israel will dwell safely now this is the name by which he will be called the lord our righteousness
1068684 for thus says the lord god indeed i myself will search for my sheep and seek them out
1068685 as a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day he is among his scattered sheep so will i seek out my sheep and deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day
1068686 and i will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and will bring them to their own land i will feed them on the mountains of israel in the valleys and in all the inhabited places of the country
1068687 i will feed them in good pasture and their fold shall be on the high mountains of israel there they shall lie down in a good fold and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of israel
1068688 i will feed my flock and i will make them lie down says the lord god

1068733 we want to evaluate all our energy subsidies to make sure that taxpayers are getting their moneys worth
1068734 reduce overall demand through conservation new technology and improved efficiency

1068814 its true i ought to have been able to enjoy the blessing of children but what would i have suffered if i had transmitted to my daughter the disadvantages of my looks if i saw her destined never to know the supreme blessing of being the prime object of a sensitive man i will confide it only to you my dear delphine just because i wasnt made to inspire love it does not follow that my heart is not susceptible to its most tender feelings i felt almost from infancy that with my face it would be ridiculous to love imagine what bitter feelings i would have had to taste it was ridiculous for me to love and nonetheless never had nature created a heart for which this blessing was more needed
1068815 do you think because i am poor obscure plain and little i am soulless and heartless you think wrong i have as much soul as you and full as much heart and if god had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth i should have made it as hard for you to leave me as it is now for me to leave you i am not talking to you now through the medium of custom conventionalities not even of mortal flesh it is my spirit that addresses your spirit just as if both had passed through the grave and we stood at gods feet equal as we are

1068828 as with everything with joss whedon it begins with character
1068829 hes interested in telling a story and its generally about buffy about how buffy feels about a particular subject from that comes the metaphor which monster demon vamp or situation best allows us to exploit that character moment
1068830 i think theres probably a hundred hundred and fifty stories that we have
1068831 after that i think we might have to worry about year two but im not real concerned about whether or not there will be stories to tell whenever joss eyes light up and he gets that mischevious smile that he has and he suddenly says we were gonna tell this story its almost like a campfire tale in other words its that opportunity to tell an episode of buffy he didnt get a chance to tell because buffy graduated so now we get to go and do that
1068832 when joss and i first sat down to talk about the show one of the first of many things that we agreed on was that animation on television and i mean this with no disrespect to the people whove done fine work through the years it tends to fall into two camps
1068833 there was a benchmark that was set if you can believe this ten years ago by batman animated
1068834 because our writing staff is the buffy writing staff a lot of folks jane espenson steve deknight who came on the show in later seasons never got a chance to work with some of these dynamics
1068835 they never got to do stories where willow likes xander xander likes buffy buffy has a crush on angel and angel hadnt reciprocated yet thats the fun to be able to go back and do that sort of thing the golden rule around here is that buffy writers do buffy live first which works out fine theres enough writers around here and everyones cool and because the animated series is only a half hour a script can be written in less time for me its been the wheel of fortune i cant lose
1068836 there will be some things that youll be able to draw a line from a to b and say they used that character because that fits right in with this particular episode
1068837 but we dont want to do that so much that people whove never seen the show are going i dont understand why did they just say that im a big believer in making something for a brand new audience thats accessible but if youre going to make something that has as loyal and terrific a following as the buffy following is youve got to make sure you deliver a show for them that makes them feel like its a companion part of the legend
1068838 wow i think that might be the first time ive witnessed birds flying south for winter

1069307 the procedures are not hard to go through in themselves what is difficult is you never get official approval said li nan an organizer with the china federation of defending diaoyutai islands a citizens group that advocates chinese claims to islands japan controls
1069308 what often happens is that you go and apply to hold a protest then if they dont tell you not to do that you assume you can go and do it but you have to make sure you dont violate any of the rules like not going to extremes said li
1069309 we were told not to hold any protest during the games zhang said
1069310 i have not played my very best when trying to get in on the last week or two
1069311 i was hitting shots with too many goals in mind instead of just trying to hit it close to the hole or down the fairway or knock it in the hole i was trying to make the team with every shot it sounds absurd but in a way thats the way i was going about it
1069312 its a great feeling to know im going to be on the team and not have to worry about it
1069313 this time im thinking about it because it was my no 1 goal
1069314 its on your mind but your golf will take care of itself if you dont play well you dont deserve to be on the team
1069315 its hard because you want to get on that team so bad
1069316 but you also know that the best way to get the job accomplished is to not be consumed by it one shot is not going to make or break your participation on the team more than likely but its tough its easy to say it but its another challenge to actually go out there and walk the line to do it
1069317 the pga championship is one of the four biggest tournaments of the year and the players need to prepare like they would any other week

1069323 green carbon the role of natural forests in carbon storage
1069324 natural forests are more resilient to climate change and disturbances than plantations
1069325 protecting the carbon in natural forests is preventing an additional emission of carbon from what we get from burning fossil fuel
1069326 the majority of biomass carbon in natural forests resides in the woody biomass of large old trees commercial logging changes the age structure of forests so that the average age of trees is much younger
1069327 the carbon stock of forests subject to commercial logging and of monoculture plantations in particular will therefore always be significantly less on average than the carbon stock of natural undisturbed forests
1069328 i feel like im still a teenager because im perpetually in high school
1069329 new and interesting species are still being discovered on caribbean islands despite the very small amount of natural forests remaining

1069354 the strange death of republican america chronicles of a collapsing party
1069355 republicans need look no farther than the reagan killing the fairness doctrine if they want to know what caused the gop to destroy itself with corruption and incompetence
1069356 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1069357 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1069358 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1069359 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1069360 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1069361 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1069362 choice who is unknown untested and who would immediately face withering scrutiny that he probably would not be able to handle
1069363 the reserve should only be used in the event of an emergency and that we shouldnt be tapping the reserve to provide a small short term decrease in gas prices
1069364 democrat barack obama called today for tapping the nations strategic oil reserves to help drive down gasoline prices a shift from his previous position on the issue
1069365 i do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said that we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency you have a situation lets say where there was a major oil facility in saudi arabia that was destroyed as a consequence of terrorist acts and you suddenly had huge amounts of oil taken out of the world market we wouldnt just be seeing 4 a gallon oil we could see a situation where entire sectors of the country had no oil to function at all and thats what the strategic oil reserve has to be for
1069366 goes right to an enormous vulnerability that barack has created for himself with his grandiosity
1069367 the questions now becoming who does this guy think he is i think that is the real question
1069368 goes right to an enormous vulnerability that barack has created for himself with his grandiosity
1069369 that real question to be resolved because the issue in this campaign is barack obama
1069370 if he persuades middle america hes the guy he wins so the real question has been who is this guy the questions now becoming who does this guy think he is i think that is the real question
1069371 w ho is he and who the heck does this guy think he is is becoming a real issue for barack obama
1069372 act ing like you know he thinks he is the lords gift to mankind

1069392 we werent talking about cursory stuff what kind of clothes to wear we were talking trial strategy
1069393 theres no question that these calls are privileged and we rely on that because the criminal justice system would come to a screeching halt if we had to drive to the jail every time we had to talk to our clients
1069394 anyone could call and ask that their numbers be added to the database but the problem was that we didnt do as much as we could have in publicizing this fact

1069396 im looking to do something different that the sport has never seen
1069397 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1069398 when you are nervous about everything else you put your money in a toll road
1069399 thats the logic of infrastructure returns are stable and predictable you wont get fabulously rich but youll get stable cash flow
1069400 were just looking at ways to be more efficient and thats why i used the term public private partnerships trying to find some creative solutions
1069401 the reason im avoiding taxes is because i think taxes are addictive
1069402 economic conditions are tough and are going to be very harsh on the performance of state budgets in 2008 and 2009
1069403 states are looking for long term solutions in running businesses a public private partnership is a tool in their toolboxes
1069404 weve seen an unprecedented number of headhunters recruiting for positions on the buy and sell sides
1069405 were very committed to this space our business activity has increased dramatically even this year
1069406 the argument for a public private partnership is the private sector is a lot smarter about paying attention to costs and because it has skin in the game will be more attentive to maintaining an asset over its life
1069407 elected officials often shortchange funding of maintenance because they dont want to increase user fees or taxes to pay for it
1069408 their election cycle is four years they can pass it on to someone elses watch
1069409 lotteries have infrastructure characteristics in that they have stable cash flows and high barriers to entry
1069410 they could even attract private equity investment because they are self financeable and require minimal capital expenses
1069411 lower and more predictable landing fees and terminal rentals for airlines which certainly arent flush
1069412 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1069413 researchers dont yet know how to determine which treatment is best for individual patients
1069414 we have found that there are huge gaps in our knowledge base
1069415 pain is complex and defies our ability to establish a clear definition
1069416 pain is far more than neural transmission and sensory transduction pain is a complex mixture of emotions culture experience spirit and sensation
1069417 it is possible its just the stress of having to live with the condition
1069418 physical activity is actually a natural pain reliever for most people suffering from arthritis
1069419 even minor lifestyle changes like taking a 10 minute walk three times a day can reduce the impact of arthritis on a persons daily activities and help to prevent developing more painful arthritis
1069420 the impact of a bullet can push the metal and plastic bits of the bra into an officers body causing serious injury

1069456 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
1069457 either someone will buy who wants a tenant or if someone who buys the home wants to move in i will move out without a fight
1069458 but i am taking stand based on principle that i will not move out without a fight as long as the bank owns the property
1069459 their the banks accumulation of property is growing week by week
1069460 this is clearly a case where the bank doesnt care what happens to a neighborhood

1069550 with the visuals and the stories and the excitement and crowds like this coming to talk about them it would have been unthinkable theres no way we could have imagined it when we created the characters
1069551 what if it was a symbiote invasion of new york its spider man vs all of new york
1069552 is the perfect character with his abilities its a perfect match
1069553 movies are linear you have a beginning middle and end with video games youre writing many stories and the job of writing is a much more difficult one
1069554 i thought that in the beginning video games were kind of clever but now you see these games and its like youre watching the greatest superhero movies except youre part of it youre inside the movie
1069555 were taking the largest army of superheroes and were allowing the players to fuse the characters abilities
1069556 all i can say is that it starts with secret war and it takes it from there
1069557 the first thing we do is open up all the comics and just pour through them
1069558 actually model these characters so we have to add detail that may not be in the comics
1069559 the costumes are everything the game is about the characters and making you feel powerful
1069560 i would come up with the basic idea then id ask the artist to draw it hating myself because i cant draw it myself because i knew exactly what i was looking for when the artists finally drew the costume it was always better than i had envisioned if hadnt worked with artists who were nearly as good i wouldnt be here id be looking for a job
1069561 im helping to lead a staff of over 100 artists
1069562 were really working toward making this game the best experience possible
1069563 the disney pixar thing has been in development for a couple years
1069564 were the only company outside of pixar that is allowed to do original material based on pixar characters
1069565 the idea is to do at least one ongoing series ive been percolating on
1069566 after we did the tie in with myspace the numbers for issues four and five had a thirty percent bump which is unlike anything ive ever seen
1069567 this is the first time ive seen this in all my years in comics
1069568 this goes back to my mission of digital delivery its the way to go
1069569 we talk about license properties i get a twitch in my eye
1069570 it brought a lot of gamers into comic books stores were every happy about that
1069571 the city contracted to have these robots fix the roads and everything and of course they went with the lowest bidder
1069572 there are pockets of methane ice at the ocean floor all over the world its combustible ice a nuclear submarine gets trapped in the ice and they cant scuttle it because if they do its like lighting a match in a can of gasoline so they have to send in a crew whos never dived that deep before
1069573 his best friend during this time was jim bowie of bowie knife fame its quite a partnering bowie was a deputized marshal
1069574 if youre not familiar with the necronomicon or lovecraft its incredibly accessible material if you are an h p lovecraft fan bill does an excellent job reproducing that pulpy flavor of the 20s and 30s
1069575 its a post apocalyptic story where mankind has reverted back to a feudal lifestyle
1069576 it goes to a place we couldnt in the series
1069577 it picks up literally in the last few seconds of peacekeeper wars

1069584 coming up with those two wins did a lot for her
1069585 she then went to the fair july 24 governors day at the delaware state fair in harrington and had a big win for 20 000 1 56
1069586 shes really come around this summer yeah shes been sharp
1069587 they were kind of torturing each other i was hoping that come to the half 55 4 it wouldnt take the life out of mine too it worked out good for me
1069588 hes a little tiny horse but he has a lot of heart and hell give you 100
1069589 i told him ill train him for you if you let me drive him
1069590 i told him if i win id like to propose to cathy cathy sebring in the winners circle the horse was a long shot but is training good and were in a class where were competitive well give it a shot
1069591 n o temos nada a comentar a decis o do tc
1069592 pensamos que n o para legislar em mat rias que s o de interesse perfeitamente lateral para a madeira e para os madeirenses que o presidente do governo regional alberto jo o jardim quer aprofundar a autonomia infelizmente o que se verifica que a assembleia legislativa da madeira vem legislando extravasando as suas compet ncias
1069593 o diploma nacional apenas previa a adapta o das compet ncias administrativas da lei regi o e o governo regional tentou fazer altera es de conte do violando claramente a constitui o
1069594 n o foi novidade porque a assembleia legislativa n o podia alterar a ess ncia da lei nacional
1069595 o tc decidiu acabar com a aberra o deste diploma que n o contribu a para a sa de p blica
1069596 na altura chamei aten o que a lei foi acatada pacificamente na regi o pelo que n o havia motivos para qualquer altera o
1069597 n o com surpresa que vejo a decis o do tc porque a regi o n o tem compet ncias para alterar uma lei nacional
1069598 testing the integrity of data communications over networks isps and firewalls
1069599 until now there hasnt been a reliable way to tell if somebody a hacker an isp corporate firewall or the great firewall of china is modifying your internet traffic en route
1069600 designed to make general purpose isp testing faster and easier
1069601 give whatever it is that you feel is missing in your relationship and you will immediately receive the same thing in return
1069602 at this point given that we have plenty of money in the bank it makes a lot more sense not to distract ourselves with trying to put the finishing touches on a revenue plan
1069603 unless we have a reliable service that works the way we think it should
1069604 for over the last 200 years youve seen big companies grow off the concept of real time updates
1069605 if you look at media companies like thomson reuters or bloomberg or the stock exchange people and businesses are dependent on real time news coming in as it happens twitter is similar except its much broader than just one kind of news like stock updates so when you think of it that broadly as a utility i think you can begin to imagine how big the potential is for twitter as a commercial entity
1069606 how would they respond to us putting ads on the site
1069607 there is a level of intent that someone is showing when they come to a twitter search and type in say iphone
1069608 these folks are influencers and they want to talk about the hottest or latest stuff going on
1069609 if youve got 1 000 people following you somethings happening
1069610 the real potential is in the future when youve got 10 000 people following
1069611 listening to some of these flight attendants youd think that working a flight was like a tour of duty in vietnam
1069612 this has been happening since the wright brothers of course people are going to get angry theyre flying in a metal tube
1069613 i suddenly heard strange voices women broadcasting addresses and numeric codes
1069614 if they had the word i guess youd have called me a nerd
1069615 how to get my ex girlfriend back she keeps ignoring me what am i suppose to do
1069616 would it be possible for you to call me back i need you to talk to you about something
1069617 msgr harris had denied the allegations which concern actions that allegedly occurred 20 year ago
1069618 i took my time i care this is worth something
1069619 and so once i made it into this coliseum place two large angry gorillas come at me so i start shooting and then there were two panthers coming at me so i shot at them too
1069620 how do i know where to start with your marketing

1069623 use this property to specify the initial value of the input control
1069624 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
1069625 views the beijing games as being about while this sentiment may ring true for u
1069626 sport is one factor though often a peculiarly symbolic one in the complicated process of change in how people feel about themselves their countries and their governments
1069627 the coming olympic games may well turn into a mega drama with far reaching implications
1069628 the ultimate winners however will never stand on a podium although their logos will be on view throughout the course of the event transnational corporations will reign supreme in beijing just as they have been doing for at least the past 30 years and western capitalist values will have taken another step closer to the winning line
1069629 olympic skater joey cheek has organized 380 olympic athletes from 56 countries to join in raising awareness and bringing an end to the crisis in darfur
1069630 there is definitely pressure on athletes to fit in and to not upset sponsors their national team and the united states olympic committee
1069631 with a tour like this there is no revolution in thought or values ultimately exchanges such as these prepare the people in both countries to work toward and sustain peace between their respective governments
1069632 provides a more nuanced look at the sino african relationship which under certain circumstances could act as a catalyst for positive political change in africa
1069633 the research and information system for developing countries points out that bank analyses showed a successful conclusion of the doha round would by 2015 increase developing country income in total by 16 billion a year less than a penny a day for every person in the developing world
1069634 in the face of the looming specter of climate change these negotiations amount to arguing over the arrangement of deck chairs while the titanic is sinking
1069635 a derailment of doha wont be a sufficient condition to formulate a strategy to contain climate change but given the likely negative ecological consequences of a successful deal its a necessary condition
1069636 what do governments want from sport and what do they get
1069637 lenovo designed olympic torch for beijing 2008 olympic games unveiled by beijing organizing committee
1069638 many use the term flat earther as a term of abuse and with connotations that imply blind faith ignorance or even anti intellectualism
1069639 coming across some literature from the flat earth society a few years ago
1069640 i came to realise how much we take at face value
1069641 we humans seem to be pleased with just accepting what we are told no matter how much it goes against our senses
1069642 the earth is flat and horizontally infinite it stretches horizontally forever
1069643 obviously it isnt perfectly flat thanks to geological phenomena like hills and valleys it is around 24 900 miles in diameter
1069644 sheer incredulity to the conviction that its all just an elaborate joke
1069645 without a platform for communication a head count is almost impossible
1069646 if you will forgive my use of the term global
1069647 the space agencies of the world are involved in an international conspiracy to dupe the public for vast profit
1069648 this is perhaps one of the most commonly asked questions
1069649 a cursory examination of a flat earth map fairly well explains the reason the north pole is central and antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the earth circumnavigation is a case of travelling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth
1069650 as a rule of thumb we dont have any fears of aircraft or other modes of transportation
1069651 flat earth theory is one of the ultimate conspiracy theories
1069652 naturally flat earth believers think that the moon landings were faked as were the photographs of earth from space
1069653 you should be skeptical in the case of the episode of the government but you shouldnt just make shit up
1069654 the invisible and the non existent look very much alike
1069655 deaths in the bible god 2 270 365 not including the victims of noahs flood sodom and gomorrah or the many plagues famines fiery serpents etc because no specific numbers were given satan 10
1069656 so far as i can remember there is not one word in the gospels in praise of intelligence
1069657 group selection of any kind is not darwinism as darwin understood it nor as i understand it
1069658 scientists who study flavor chemistry have identified more than four hundred compounds that go into the taste of a ripe tomato and more than thirty of those are regarded as essential
1069659 and seriously who is running the style department at espn linda hasnt worn a fashionable ladysuit since 96 and amy k nelson looks like an atlantic city sweat pants whore
1069660 el post porno consiste en la representaci n de las sexualidades alternativas es salirse de la industria
1069661 por ejemplo me gusta el porno hardcore pero con mujeres poderosas que sometan a hombres pasivos y d biles si una chica flaca y enfermiza puede llegar a ser sexy por qu no lo puede ser un t o
1069662 es una cr tica no nos gusta como trata a la mujer la pornograf a de este modo plasmamos nuestras inquietudes
1069663 estamos hartas del porno genital ves una imagen l sbica y en realidad est rodada bajo una visi n heterosexual nosotras nos planteamos todo desde otra perspectica desde el sadomasoquismo a los roles de g nero
1069664 visibiliza a aquellxs que hasta ahora hab amos sido ignoradxs cuerpos considerados desviados patol gicos y los mostramos como algo bello que no hay que cambiar
1069665 mi trabajo es el pornoterrorismo una fusi n entre la imagen sexual y la pornograf a que ves en el telediario como por ejemplo un t o explotado en el mercado quiero conseguir excitar a trav s del terror desbloquear los mecanismos de excitaci n
1069666 no hay pornograf a sin un contexto legal que defina los l mites de lo que es p blicamente visible comparte con el movimiento punk un cierto gusto por el fe smo una est tica barata y anticonsumista y la conciencia de que buena parte de la batalla pol tica se libra en el cuerpo
1069667 por qu yo debo estar siempre debajo si fuimos creados iguales

1069672 will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
1069673 we are hopeful that this return will be sooner rather than later
1069674 the sheriffs department has now released information that the other vehicle ran the red light while striking shias truck
1069675 received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 miles per hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
1069676 we are very appreciative again of the patience that everyone has shown us and of the many concerned citizens who have stepped forward to provide information regarding this collision
1069677 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1069678 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1069679 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
1069680 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
1069681 in my opinion this result is too complex for meaningful interpretation or inclusion
1069682 lets look at the question that is being asked is there dna from madeleine on the swab
1069683 it would be very simple to say yes simply because of the number of components within the result that are also in her reference sample
1069684 what we need to consider as scientists is whether the match is genuine because madeleine has deposited dna as a result of being in the car or whether madeleine merely appears to match the result by chance
1069685 we cannot answer the question is the match genuine or is it a chance match
1069686 the portuguese attorney general in his recent statement made it very clear indeed that theres absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing by kate and gerry in any way shape or form and journalists should bear that in mind when they examine the police files
1069687 a lot of this is historical detail drafted by officers who failed to find
1069688 all that matters is the search for madeleine kate and gerrys lawyers are continuing to examine all of the information in minute detail and where anything that is relevant to finding madeleine needs to be done it will be
1069689 we have the ability to serve video to lots of different pc and mac environments that otherwise would not get the greatest experience with traditional live streaming
1069690 this will definitely be the first time that something like this has been done on this scale
1069691 silverlight lacks the ubiquity that developers need to push our software out there but having multiple cameras all streaming into a single player is something we havent yet been able to achieve in online video
1069692 the ubiquity and install base is the name of the game and even with the olympics its going to be difficult for microsoft to get the ubiquity with silverlight that adobe has with flash at least in the short term
1069693 the content is going to be stunning just really great quality and even if you have a slow connection the bandwidth scales to take advantage of your pipe automatically
1069694 so do all the other splendid buildings in washington d c for you are a citizen of the united states

1069700 la noticia del ministerio de cultura no es nueva entre nosotros y siempre ha sido usada como un paliativo a las protestas
1069701 yo he sentido que este lugar es muy importante dado que aqu est la plaza tiananmen y el gran sal n del pueblo por tanto aqu hab a historia poder y ahora cultura y el teatro es cultura
1069702 por supuesto se debe ser respetuoso con los edificios pero tambi n tiene que buscarse ser diferente por tanto realmente decid que propondr a algo nuevo algo creativo pens hagamos una clase de isla en el agua algo como en los cuentos las leyendas que no puedes tocar pero puedes ir por debajo para ingresar es un cuento de la gente descubriendo un para so el descubrimiento de un sue o de ficci n el teatro es eso la pera es eso
1069703 conf o realmente que en 20 o 30 a os la gente al ver la pera piense esta es arquitectura china t pica est enraizada en china ning n pedazo de piedra vino de otro lado
1069704 melcochita el resultado es desconcertante desde la portada que muestra la misma foto de car tula del primer disco pero con algunos apurados retoques una rareza total que estriba entre lo esperp ntico y lo fascinante
1069705 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
1069706 after the remarkable progress in the security situation the ministry e mailed the doctors who have fled the country in the past to ask them to return back to develop the health sector in the country
1069707 we agree that the return of the fathers of medicine is important to this great country
1069708 they represent a significant population of senior physicians and surgeons and their return is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader
1069709 the justice department has failed to provide to the public any shred of evidence that really would link ivins in any kind of definitive way to this crime i absolutely cannot come up with a motive with access and the complicated things that would need to be done if he were a loner doing such an act and i am struck by the fact that there appears to have been at least two previous people who were pointed to who appear to have been patsies steven hatfill being one and ayaad assaad being another

1069711 nu privesc emisiunile de televiziune cel putin in romania unde acestea sunt pur si simplu dezgustatoare prin slugarnicie sub cultura si un gen de suprarealitate unde nu se poate identifica aproape nimic din viata cotidiana de la noi
1069712 daca vorbim punctual nici macar in turcia nu exista mall uri in mijlocul orasului caci galleries la fayette din paris sau el corte ingles din barcelona nu sunt mall uri dar la noi sunt si intentia unora este sa le intinda pana chiar in preajma ateneului sub privirile prostite ale unei majoritati ce isi pierde vremea cu privitul la televizor video un interviu in imagini
1069713 vom avea o re asezare nu o prabusire in domeniului imobiliarului pentru locuinte caci intr o tara unde sunt atat de multe cereri si atat de putina oferta inca multa vreme de acum inainte foamea de case nu va fi indestulata
1069714 strainii care cumpara aici pentru a face o afacere vin in ideea unui profit mai mare decat la ei si dintr un anumit punct de vedere nu gresesc in imediat caci a castiga 11 12 pe an fata de sapte opt procente este de preferat atunci cand mentalitatea nu este aceea de pe dambovita unde milionul de dolari pare un mizilic

1069721 i am pleased to report that entercom achieved strong growth in both free cash flow and adjusted net income per share during the quarter and in the face of difficult and deteriorating general economic conditions that have significantly impacted earnings from a broad range of consumer facing businesses
1069722 i am also very pleased by entercoms second quarter operating results third quarter results will reflect declining business fundamentals but looking ahead radio broadcasting is well positioned for resumed growth radio listenership in the u s reached an all time record this past year and radio is the most cost effective major advertising medium in the nation

1069725 we are working as hard as we can to prevent another cross border infection
1069726 our team will continue to raise awareness about the virus reappearance in nearby nigeria we will make sure inspectors are actively blocking any illegal imports and that they quickly act on any suspected cases
1069727 to put a ban on anything when you do not have the means to control ports of entry pushes people into clandestine trade
1069728 clandestine commerce makes things worse because you cannot control and monitor the problem bans on poultry are not functional this is a part of the world where there has been cross border trade for centuries managing risks makes more biological sense
1069729 despite 20 years of research the development of a hormonal method acceptable to a wide population of men is unlikely

1069731 the pharmaceutical industry is completely disconnected from the public and medical perceptions of need
1069732 the biggest hurdle that ive encountered in trying to share this information is a sort of knee jerk reaction that men arent interested in these kinds of contraceptives and that women wont trust them to take them
1069733 my wife has never been that comfortable with the pill so it would be nice to have some other options on my end
1069734 if we had a compound that was 99 effective then the drug companies would be on board the fda would be on board and consumers would embrace it
1069735 the six month moratorium is suggested here as the most credible foundation and seed for the retransformation of market trends and micro level pricing behaviour into stable and predictable modes
1069736 we have the power to invoke further measures but we do not want to use the emergency rules emergency measures can be taken but we do not want that yet we can do that to deter unjustified price increases
1069737 our only problem is that the maximum withdrawals have been increased to z 2 trillion us 200 per customer per day and as a result we have run out of cash the reserve bank has not given us any additional supplies of money
1069738 what monetary policy that was a political statement that was made the nonsense about zimbabwe being under sanctions was not monetary there were a few currency changes but that is where it ends freezing wages is not going to end hyperinflation
1069739 the main causer of hyperinflation is gideon gono who is printing money which is being used for handouts and is being given to political thugs to beat up people
1069740 we are looking at a situation whereby the us dollarisation of the economy is going to increase because our own money would have become worthless

1069749 we didnt try and get cute with this album and pick some out da box beats and get on some philosophy sh t we did what we knew best and that was rhyme about the street while of course infusing the humor that you know youre going to get when you listen to our rhymes
1069750 i warmly congratulate the united states government on the new legislation that will allow for 48 billion to be spent on the fight against aids tb and malaria over the next five years
1069751 we know how to do it we should do it now
1069752 our programming strategy is to try to deliver the best experience on the best platform and by far that is the best way when youre looking at 2 900 hours of live coverage youve got to make some decisions and we need to address the audience and i think we are you also need to consider major advertisers and affiliates and nbcs own investment that all comes to bear on the programming strategy you look at that ideal experience 8 00 p m on saturday night and sunday and monday night the place to be is in your living room and given the time difference the time and place to be monday morning at your desk may be at your laptop what were trying to do is expand this so broadly i think that effort alone is reasonable were taking a big leap from torino of two hours live and upped it 2 000 i think were going to take a deep breath after this and look to the future and think weve done a pretty good job of addressing that when i want it what i want it attitude thats pretty pervasive
1069753 we ve got these passionate passionate taekwondo fans passionate equestrian fans folks who ve grown up playing the sports whose children play them and for whom the olympics is the ultimate expression of their sport despite the fact that we ve been putting it on five cable networks with as much press time as we can we have not been able to serve the audience as effective they want us to
1069754 we ve decided not to do live commentary on every hour of those more than 2 000 live streams because of the costs
1069755 this has been a big initiative with us and with the ioc as well we ve invested a lot in the olympus and as a consequence will work very hard to protect that investment weve worked with the ioc on fingerprint solutions and worked with some of the major ugc distributors including youtube to find a way to identify videos not being put out by nbc
1069756 it will be very quick i cant give you a per second by second analysis but our goal is to catch it before its posted thats the intention there s no such thing as a perfect system in the world of the internet because theres always a place some analog method where someone can post something
1069757 we spent a tremendous time of amount and effort to deliver the olympics and the best experiences we can and we want to make sure we preserve that because that reflects well on the olympics and reflects well on nbc
1069758 we have to deliver what we promise and we have to work hard to preserve the integrity of the brand at the same time this is a seismic shift from one game to another and this hasnt been a long period of time going from 2 hours to more than 2 000 to 3 500 on demand and multiple platform that shows real responsiveness to the market
1069759 web 2 0 is one of those big buzzwords that no one knows what it means if it means that the world is a community and tying that community together we do have a strategy there
1069760 the rights landscape is what it is we are protecting our rights within our territory
1069761 its not necessarily an environment that lends itself to germination of ideas and people sharing clips and being able to form communities over time i mean youre going to be in and out of swimming in eight or nine days so thats why we think the better place for this is in universal sports where you can form that community and lend people the tools to experiment
1069762 you pass it to your friends and the faster you pass you win or if you drop it you get notified i think its a fun application and it helps people connect we find ways for people to connect but ultimately we want people to go to nbcolympics com because we think its the best place to experience these games
1069763 we cant deliver you results for 34 sports and 10 000 athlete bios and breaking news every day in a facebook widget its not complete and so we think the best experience is to come to nbcolympics com as a hub and connect to other places
1069764 weve had enough columnists bash hipsters we need more bands
1069765 ghana telecom under the current circumstances stands the risk of losing its slender market share of 16 per cent if nothing drastic in the form of a strategic partner is sought to salvage the woes of the company
1069766 we have nothing against the sale in our estimation we believe that government must go ahead with the process and ensure that the company becomes relevant and competitive in providing service to its customers
1069767 it was important to gain international leverage and muscle to compete on the market
1069768 personally i think that government should have given out between 40 to 60 per cent and monitored the trends thereafter
1069769 the collective bargaining agreement which has been negotiated would be applied to the letter and compensation paid out appropriately
1069770 what i wish to suggest here is that government must make the compensation to be paid out available in an escrow account to guarantee benefits to those who might be affected
1069771 any reason why we as pioneers in the telecommunications business should not also open up to that international partnerships that would not only enhance our operations but also introduce a sustainable cash flow regime that would maximize shareholder value
1069772 in times past we were not allowed to go ahead to operate mobile telephony but now that we have the opportunity and has started the sky should be the limit in our quest to give our clients the best of services
1069773 it is got to do with the survival of the company and we must scale above the politics when discussing the transaction
1069774 but it is not the kind of transformation that gt can make in isolation as a stand alone company in todays competitive environment
1069775 he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1069776 the somali people knew there would be challenges on the path to peace and they should not be discouraged
1069777 as the end of the transition period is less than a year away i call on the somali people to remain united and solve their political problems
1069778 the authorities should remain focused on peace and i hope to see them shortly i call on the president the speaker the prime minister and all members of the parliament to move forward i also call on the ars to continue to encourage reconciliation
1069779 block employment of extra health staff as well as the use of international funds for salary increases in the public sector
1069780 in thyolo district malawi one nurse keeps 400 patients alive by following up their essential treatment but her basic salary amounts to just us 3 a day
1069781 it is intolerable to then be told by governments and donor countries that it is unsustainable to raise her wages even though she is responsible for us 7 500 worth of drugs a month for her patients those willing to support funding for medicines must find ways to cover recurrent costs like salaries for health workers
1069782 africa has not had industrial policies for the last 20 years
1069783 the way forward is to look at where the continent is compared to the rest of the world and to identify areas in which to diversify industries in order to create a strong export base
1069784 our assessment is that promotion of specific industries generally did not work and therefore holds little promise for other developing countries
1069785 in asia corruption or rent seeking and rent creation is rampant
1069786 but in these countries rents were achievable through activities which served national interests and the realisation of rents was related to performance standards in other words money from corruption was kept in the country which benefited the national economy
1069787 in contrast many leaders in africa have used graft money to open swiss bank accounts which does not benefit their countries
1069788 africa needs development coalitions which might consist of state actors business partners and workers that share some ideological position on development and collectively have the capacity and will to push the development agenda
1069789 z 5 trillion is a lot of money and a lot of people over the weekend were actually busy trying to convert their accounts to other accounts which would require less minimum balances
1069790 the announcement that old coins are coming back into circulation will benefit people who do not have a banking culture which will send a wrong signal to the market at a time when confidence building should be a top priority to the central bank
1069791 is touring for a few scattered dates throughout western canada and the american midwest in october and early november
1069792 jess has no problem showing tony her favorite pussycat dolls routine she will dance in front of her camera until she makes her man happy
1069793 jess does get paranoid making sure tony doesnt have any of his cowboys buddies peeking in on the show
1069794 if you have a very short term view its certainly not good news
1069795 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
1069796 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all of this works is disturbing

1069803 dont make any big decisions for at least a year
1069804 launched an absurd project to impose democracy all over the world
1069805 the us has a strange idea of democracy they first interfered with the bosnian situation bombed yugoslavia then afghanistan and then iraq
1069806 the us must understand that democracy cannot be introduced by force by the army
1069807 the defibrillator was right there as planned and our staff did a great job in using their training to help the student
1069808 this is a signal to our residents that we will make sure we have an excellent library system

1069810 if these bonusgate allegations are true our state government is broken
1069811 occurred on his watch and even though mr deweese claims he knew nothing about them he was still the leader when the bonuses were allegedly given out for political work in 2006
1069812 we need a break from the past we must enact real change for the people of pennsylvania
1069813 bill deweese doesnt have the publics trust and we need leaders that do have that trust
1069814 it is not a new schedule i think bruce was just stating that the schedule in place is in fact very aggressive we plan to break ground this fall and are working to open in calendar year 2010 while thats the goal if it is not met then it would end up being calendar year 2011
1069815 we saw the rise in food prices and were very pro agricultural commodities we also did well holding insurance companies
1069816 hypocritical and political there is a lot of noise around this things are being made up on the hoof to keep political masters happy
1069817 people want to find a scapegoat we were 0 28 short on bradford amp bingley stock that was a 1m position it is not our fault that bradford and bingley was in trouble
1069818 investors should be starting to look further out and be expecting to make the real money some few years hence with the view that buying shares over the next nine months may feel painful but may turn out to have been not only courageous but brilliantly timed
1069819 they are really just revolutions of the new commons like this
1069820 this was the foundation for the revolution of the commons in which we do not dream of a future but implement it in the present
1069821 taylor was so nice and so cool she took the subway from her apartment in chelsea to the set with her mom they said they didnt want to do the usual obvious stuff that a teen tv star would do they were looking for really high end things
1069822 were delighted to have dance back for a fifth season next year
1069823 fox is very lucky to have televisions preeminent performance competitions in american idol and so you think you can dance and its no coincidence that creator and executive producer simon fuller and executive producer and judge nigel lythgoe have been a part of both these successes
1069824 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1069825 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices
1069826 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1069827 the market is increasing the odds now that the drilling deal will get done and we will see more production coming out of the gulf of mexico
1069828 the oil markets main focus right now is on any weakness that signals a slowdown in the economy and this personal spending report is further evidence of that
1069829 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1069830 when you have been killed as many times as i have you get used to it believe me
1069831 some of the parents that went to earlier court motions said they couldnt handle it anymore
1069832 i dont see how she couldnt be the one driving
1069833 there are a lot more complicated issues than just copyright or trademark there are more complex issues than those in respect to the end user licensing agreement and antitrust issues come into play too
1069834 you agree not to install use or run the apple software on any non apple labeled computer or to enable others to do so
1069835 but take a look at the web site of the lead attorney representing apple
1069836 they came to us i think because this is a much bigger issue than just copyright
1069837 theres the fact that we are in the jurisdiction of the u s district court for northern california but weve also tangled with apple before weve dealt with apple so were familiar with the courts and the parties
1069838 what psystar might say is what we would like to do is use the mac operating systems unique features more broadly on a variety of hardware
1069839 i think its a very very hard argument to make but i wouldnt be surprised if they tried
1069840 my guess is that they will mount some kind of direct attack on apples exclusive licensing
1069841 whats the point of life why did god make all of this why bother

1069849 some youtube users are mounting a growing revolt against the sites new audio scheme which has degraded the sound quality of clips on the site by running them through an audio processor that wreaks havoc with songs dynamic range the variation between loud and soft diminishing their sound quality

1069855 the story really is about the film business everything else is the same old marvel
1069856 given that iron man has been a fairly incredible success we would like to see the recognition of that in their financial performance amp if not for the period for the upcoming periods
1069857 historically they havent incorporated the impact of their movies into their outlook and i think they will probably have to revise that at this point i would think the bias would be towards the upside
1069858 im going to write with christina aguilera in mid september for her next album
1069859 it might not work she might not like any of the stuff i write and it may not make the cut but im pretty excited about it i think shes rad

1069870 its good to be taking home a trophy because the players have worked hard and it is great to have won these two matches in rotterdam
1069871 all the players put in a lot of hard work for the team and i dont think i could possibly single out any individual
1069872 but they are friendly matches and the main thing is that the team came through it and will continue to prepare for the new season
1069873 there have been some good team goals scored out here in rotterdam and its pleasing when you see everyone getting involved like young adam smith who laid on the goal for jamie
1069874 still stacy so named because its author wants to reassure everyone that despite a different template every week it is in fact the same blog
1069875 all the snark youve come to expect but with half the calories

1069877 she has a mind for jesus and a bod for sin

1069880 politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession i have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first
1069881 i had expected that the association between urological function and age would be stronger
1069882 i like to stress that sexual inactivity is not necessarily the same as erectile dysfunction reasons for not being sexually active can also be not being interested anymore or not having a partner not everybody who is sexually inactive is in need of medication

1069894 the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal
1069895 particularly in the context of the court process currently under way
1069896 i saw the premiere in l a on thursday and i was laughing from start to finish
1069897 as soon as i read the script i was like this is hilarious
1069898 it was nice to work with people who were regular people
1069899 they dont come with pomp and circumstance it was a blast
1069900 theres only two shots with the stunt double after a while i was like get rid of the stunt chick im doing it all james franco and i kind of threw away the choreography too and went for it he went for my butt too he bit my butt which wasnt great and it didnt even make the movie and i am kind of pissed off about that
1069901 i got a call and she asked me if i would do a guest role on it i said sure and now thats turned into four episodes theyre asking me to come back again and i havent even completed the fourth
1069902 i love brooke shields lindsey price and kim raver you would think that a bunch of women on a set would breed reer perez makes catfight sound it doesnt and its great and i just love it
1069903 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1069904 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1069905 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1069906 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1069907 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1069908 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1069909 im going to write with christina aguilera in mid september for her next album
1069910 it might not work she might not like any of the stuff i write and it may not make the cut but im pretty excited about it i think shes rad

1069912 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers mccain wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another barack obama a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a 1 000 rebate a president wholl stand up for you
1069913 in a dispute about race the mccain campaign knows it will end up with the larger half
1069914 for the most part most white peoples experience with race isnt one of racial discrimination they can only relate to racial discrimination in the abstract what white people can relate to is the fear of being unjustly accused of racism this is the larger half this is why allegations of racism often provoke more outrage than actual racism because most of the country can relate to one the accusation of racism easier than the other actual racism for this reason in a political conflict over race the mccain campaign has the advantage because saying the race card has been played is actually the ultimate race card
1069915 while we expect industry pressures to also weaken fords liquidity we estimate that ford will end 2009 with 15 3 billion in cash without raising additional cash
1069916 hey amy when are you coming to pick up season 7 of buffy

1069918 i suggest for your own protection that you dont talk to me for about ten days
1069919 and dont forget what it cost me nothing well theres 4 gas to run the car my tools the time
1069920 my time is valuable and id rather not spend it watching your logo animate get somebody to blog for you who has a personality and a point of view and who has information to dispense thats not available everywhere and dont censor that person into tediousness
1069921 i was looking for a bar to go to in culver city calif its amazing how hard it was to get pictures of the bar they posted beautiful shots of wine glasses and things guess what ive seen wine glasses i have them at home is your place groovy nice lighting do the chairs look comfortable does it look like youll be playing loud music or will i be able to talk to my friend thats the kind of stuff i want to know

1069925 it is my responsibility to take advantage of whatever resources i have available with so many of americas finest deployed overseas rather than stress national guard resources i leveraged the citys strong relationship with yao and coach rick adelman
1069926 you have to be resilient you find out what youre made of when deployed to perform major crowd control urban management and martial law
1069927 hes definitely had an impact on the way we defend the public during a national disaster

1069931 movials open source contribution should enable application developers and operators to innovate and create a new range of services and applications exploiting unique features of mobile devices
1069932 virtuallogix is committed to providing developers the opportunity to complement the limo specification with enhanced features and security for deployment on low cost platforms
1069933 with such a variety of industry players cost effectively adopting the limo platform more development resources are being devoted to enhancing the consumer experience
1069934 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
1069935 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of
1069936 leverages a combination of algorithmic and editorial processes to identify current relevant and popular terms
1069937 we are really only in the infancy of this kind of automated analysis
1069938 im sure its going to be expanding greatly not just in volume but in sophistication
1069939 the quality of the content and the information is paramount
1069940 you want to make sure youre striking the right balance between giving your readers everything the web has to offer with making sure theyre getting the right information and the relevant information

1069972 if he does testify no matter what he says the prosecutor will charge him with perjury hes made that pretty clear to us
