1640046 it was first time i observed a bangladesh election and i was impressed by watching so many people keen to vote
1640047 we commend the election commission for its professional administration of these elections which were an important step for the parliamentary polls and restoration of a democratically elected government in bangladesh
1640048 we want candidates with criminal records to be barred from contesting elections for that the government has to pass a law which has not been done yet there is a need to do a lot more to see that criminals are barred from elections
1640049 i feel it is on the decrease because of certain measures taken by the commission like compulsory filling of affidavits by candidates about their pasts
1640050 in the next general election the electoral rolls itself will have photographs of voters
1640051 the time was not ripe for making voting compulsory in india
1640052 if we dont get a strong number oil prices will likely fall further

1640060 we believe that execution by way of a gunfire is inhumane it is for these reasons that the defense attorneys are applying to challenge the legislation
1640061 its not a matter for us whether or not amrozi is to be executed gunfire is one way another way of doing it is by lethal injection
1640062 we believe that is still more humane than by a gunfire

1640096 i would have thought he was only 50 50 at this stage and if hes not right i am not going to play him
1640097 its disappointing because we would like to have him back as another tall option we think it will settle down once he has a break its not a long term issue its just a matter of getting him up for games
1640098 they have shown a little bit at afl level not a lot but have shown us enough to suggest that if we brought them in to the team they would handle themselves well so we have a couple of options there

1640103 retaining it function control is too often a job creation scheme for the it function and distracts from other uses of resource that add value to the organisation
1640104 given the right level of training the best systems and a culture of empowerment it should be possible to give a high level of control back to users what seems to happen though is that one of those variables is missing and the opportunity is lost

1640130 i found it interesting that on the tape iraq was mentioned which is a reminder that iraq is a part of this war against extremists
1640131 if bothers to mention iraq its because they want to achieve their objectives in iraq which is to drive us out and to develop a safe haven and the reason they want a safe haven is to launch attacks against america or any other ally

1640147 the only thing ill say is that i know coach andy reid has spent an awful lot of time with that situation ill talk about the players that are in camp here
1640148 max has taken advantage of his opportunity and he has done an excellent job
1640149 you win with guys like max max is a fighter hes big and strong and gives big effort he loves to play the game and when you love to play the game youre going to work hard and youre going to get better every day
1640150 as you know there are many players that have caught up and caught up quick and usually those are the guys that have experience
1640151 every year we come out at least one or two times
1640152 well talk to the scouts and coaches about certain players who are having a good camp and we also like to see how they run things
1640153 this sport it probably happens more times than you know and guys wont admit it
1640154 its one of those things that he was strong enough to admit it and more power to him
1640155 i dont think we have any guys on this team who wouldnt want the best for shawn
1640156 i think everybody here including the coaches want the best for shawn they understand how grave the situation is were going to do everything we can to make it an easy transition and get ready for the season
1640157 in life you dont want to show weakness but youve got to do what youve got to do if you let depression get control of you youre done you might as well handle it now
1640158 im not a doctor but depression can stem from anything
1640159 money doesnt make you happy obviously he is successful he just got a new deal all those things dont necessarily make you happy
1640160 he is too good a player to have something like that lay him down other than that i dont know what kind of stigma it holds theres a lot of pressure on people in the game that outsiders really dont know about
1640161 everybody handles things differently theres a lot of other outside forces at work it was a good choice on his part to stay away heaven forbid youre going through depression and then you came to practice and got someone else hurt now youve got that on top of you too
1640162 im here for him but as a player i am going to do what i have to do to make this team
1640163 i feel sorry for him im with him but ive got to do what ive got to do
1640164 depression is something you dont want to play with when a person is depressed he needs as much support as he can get hopefully the guys who did have negative things to say about it will follow suit and rally around him
1640165 a lot of people think it cant happen this is a very tough game its a nonstop job they say off season but there really isnt an off season
1640166 you could talk to shawn and hed tell you the same thing
1640167 andy has been nothing but sensitive to shawns situation he didnt disclose this personal issue even though he has been peppered with questions about it
1640168 andy didnt find out shawn wasnt mentally prepared to go to camp until 24 hours before
1640169 i talked to andy right after that and he told me it was in shawns best interest for me to fly to little rock and assess the situation andy thought it would be best if we made shawn a doctors appointment
1640170 once we got the appointment it took a few days to find out the diagnosis that finally happened last thursday and it took a few days for shawn to feel comfortable about it
1640171 why would you not send the letter if you dont know what the problem is they didnt know until they finally got the diagnosis it was andy who suggested to me that i go meet with shawn and andy has communicated with shawn and directly with the doctor weve been working together to do whats best for shawn and whats best for the eagles
1640172 now that coach reid understands that i have stepped forward and i do have a problem and im trying to get it rectified i think hes more sensitive to whats going on
1640173 i admitted that some of the rumors that have been out there actually were started by myself initially he didnt know what to think because im telling him one thing and hes hearing all these other rumors coach reid he does have a heart and i respect coach reid and the organization
1640174 im still under a doctors care i have another appointment thursday and i cant go in there faking im ready to go back the problem isnt going to go away if i fake it im going to see my doctor and my medication is slowly taking effect so i hope to be back and i want to be back well see how it plays out
1640175 this is a job for us but they are protecting everything that this country is about
1640176 if youre not going to be supportive of that and theyre coming out here to get away from reality as an american you have to support them the reality is theyre fighting a couple different wars right now
1640177 im just proud of what they stand for and the job they are doing
1640178 we go away for training camp for a month they go away for a year and a half at a time theyre coming out here to watch us as a break i feel honored that they chose us to come and watch
1640179 we flew over the ocean and did all the tricks they use in the show
1640180 i will be out of the office please call my cell phone
1640181 the year abroad experience changes you in ways that you cant really know about or anticipate

1640188 we found some other beautifully modeled heads but they just werent rigged for animation at all monicas mesh layout was outstanding the detail around the eyes and the skin textures were just awesome it was something we could take and add life like animation on to very easily
1640189 its hard to tell parents how to interact with their children based on one study but what we see here is that parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to try to direct and control their children during a play period
1640190 as a result these children were less cooperative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
1640191 of course all parents direct their children and people in general are always directing others to close a door or hand them something
1640192 its something we do all the time but there is a qualitative difference in the kinds of directing going on by these verbally aggressive mothers by looking at how and when directives occurred not just how often we found that moms who scored highest on verbal aggression used directives to control the child and ultimately the way the game or activity was played the aggressive action is not overt as in a parent hitting or yelling but these small negative maneuvers can say so much to a child
1640193 we all say things to our children that we regret saying but saying a lot of things that attack a childs self confidence is not healthy
1640194 these parents were in an unstructured low stress environment and if we saw this behavior in such a brief setting how could such negative interactions even so subtle affect a child over the long term for example if the parents always have to control what activity they and their children are going to play as well as for how long and how they are going to play it you wonder if this communicates to the child that what they want to do doesnt matter
1640195 epic is more than just a route or a race it is a dynamic experience it isnt just about pedalling for a few minutes seconds or beating a competitor
1640196 i did say something else which i cant repeat but as it happens i did exactly that
1640197 history has shown that most games i have played for england the oval has been pretty lucky for me throughout my career
1640198 most test matches there i have taken five wickets i have this confidence about the oval
1640199 dev talks about getting hit on the head which spurred him on to bowl so fast but he got a roasting from mike at the end of their first innings
1640200 he was bowling at their tailenders allan donald and de villiers and pitching the ball up and getting driven
1640201 mike wanted him to bang a few bouncers into them but i dont know whether its the fast bowlers union but devon didnt want to do it
1640202 i dont know whether that roasting inspired him to bowl faster in the second innings
1640203 i came into bat and i heard one of the guys say let him have one
1640204 i thought it was a bluff and was expecting a yorker but fanie bowled the perfect bouncer at my head
1640205 thats when i waved my bat at the slips and i said you guys are history
1640206 his bowling was very hostile and aggressive but he bowled very straight
1640207 he didnt give the batsman too many options he got peter kirsten with a top edge caught by defreitas on the boundary from that moment on nobody took him on for the hook shot and he peppered them
1640208 he bowled the perfect armpit ball to gary kirsten which he ended up lobbing back to devon a caught and bowled which was a rare thing for devon
1640209 if you look on the footage he was in the perfect forward defence position but the ball bowled him half an hour before he put the bat down
1640210 a couple of balls before that i went around the wicket and he was fending the ball from around his earholes then i pitched the ball up over the wicket thats what a good fast bowler does because he was tentative from the short pitched stuff
1640211 he was in my face and i said dazza why did you spoil my party laughed malcolm
1640212 i recently played a twenty20 match for the pca against the bajan xi there and it almost clicked again
1640213 i wish i could have the oval pitch in my back yard i just love playing there i feel as if its my own i dont care who im playing there
1640214 this entire case rests upon the statement of adam pacman jones
1640215 after making a deal with the state where felony charges were dismissed so that he could get himself reinstated with the nfl
1640216 its good to be king if just for a while
1640217 the benching certainly meant something throughout the evaluation leading up to the draft that was one reason we had the opportunity to select him in the seventh round but he gets into our training camp now its a clean slate lets go hes got every opportunity to make the most of this
1640218 theres no question he has the measurables size the long arms it appears like he has the skill and ability to really be a good tackle
1640219 now were early hes got a lot of hard work and preparation left to go
1640220 he was telling me to keep working hard he asked me how i thought it was offensive line coach juan castillo told me going in it was going to be a battle its about what i expected
1640221 i guess im doing something good he didnt really get on me about anything
1640222 hes a good athlete hes got a little bit of a sore ankle but hes played through that and hes done very well with it it hurts him a little bit when hes being bull rushed because he cant put his foot in the ground like he wants to hes moving around very well hes got very long arms and knows how to use them hes not afraid to play the game out in front of him ive been impressed with the way hes handled himself
1640223 not really my teammates more just everybody who had doubts about me
1640224 coming in here the coaches believe in me they wouldnt have taken me if they didnt but proving outsiders wrong everybody who didnt think i would be any good thats really my motivation right now

1640230 we are aware of shawns situation through his representation agent rich moran we are monitoring the situation
1640231 the teams idea was for me to come up there the nfl is a big deal especially in philadelphia
1640232 obviously there was a situation going on if there wasnt hed have been here at camp
1640233 im glad that now hes finding help and that hell be better soon
1640234 we have a lot of good guys who can help
1640235 i think everybody here including coaches would want the best for shawn and understand be very sympathetic to his situation were going to do everything we can to make it the easiest transition and try to get him ready for the season
1640236 you never know whats on the other side of the life
1640237 family money theres a lot of other forces besides football that could affect him
1640238 this is his fifth year he knows the system he knows what he can do hes a pro bowl caliber player hes all pro
1640239 its not like guys are going to be like ah he just doesnt want to play if theres something going on and he just needed to get a handle on it i dont think anybodys going to turn a cold shoulder to him because of that

1640366 i know the attention has been on the guys like asafa and usain as well as the americans but it was the same last year it doesnt matter to me that people are talking about them because the olympics are the only thing that matters this year and im confident i can be on the podium in beijing
1640367 in beijing it could take running in the 9 7s to get a medal but i think ill be ready to do that
1640368 i always see things positively on the start line we are all human beings gay bolt powell they are all human beings like anybody else and i feel im just as capable of getting a medal as anybody else as well

1640372 i think ive proved in the past that i know what it takes to be ready for the major championships and people know that im the type of sprinter that needs plenty of races to reach my peak so nobody i know is reading too much into my times so far this season im still going to be there and there have been enough signs of the old francis this season to give me confidence itll all be there in beijing
1640373 im not going to say i can beat usain and asafa they are running exceptionally well at the moment but i feel confident in what i can do from 60 metres ive got to be there and then i can make up a lot of ground over the last part of the race
1640374 however i like the fact that ive been below the radar it allows me and my coach to just do what weve got to do in search of that perfect race without all the outside attention which can sometimes be a distraction

1640390 so you have had another terrible trial its still alas the same old story to live long is to outlive many and after all we dont even know then what it was all about the answer to part of the riddle is we each have something peculiarly our own that we mean to develop by letting it take its course this strange thing cheats us from day to day and so we grow old without knowing how it happened or why

1640393 we think that by 2011 at the latest these cigarettes will be on the market
1640394 its very important that there is a social mix we make sure that the politicians soldiers officers and civil servants are all mixed up which also keeps things open
1640395 the atmosphere at the unit is very convivial and peaceful irrespective of their ages or their problems they look out for each other as a group they keep food for each other if someone is going to be late they take time off from studying their cases and play cards together

1640398 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects

1640400 dat vind ik echt vreselijk een paar jaar geleden hoorde de bouwer van het schip ir h w stapel van de rdm al van het plan het schip met de boeg naar de maashaven af te meren
1640401 die gekken willen haar met de kont naar zee leggen dat mag niet hoor riep hij vertoornd tijdens een symposium op de wilhelminapier
1640402 je kunt haar zo niet goed fotograferen zegt een man met camera
1640403 de argumenten voor het met de boeg naar zee afmeren hoor je vooral van mensen van mijn leeftijd en die gevaren hebben zegt de 69 jarige oostrijck
1640404 maar dit schip zal niet meer varen en hoeft dus ook niet meer met de kop richting zee te liggen
1640405 ikzelf had haar graag aan de wilhelminakade zien liggen maar je weet dat dat niet realistisch is zegt oostrijck
1640406 hier op katendrecht is ze goed bereikbaar is er alle ruimte om te parkeren en het is ook goed voor de kaap
1640407 als je komt aanrijden bij het schip rijst die enorme boeg hoog boven de kade uit

1640429 the responses were the responses of people there who were working hard willing to work and satisfied with what was happening in the plant
1640430 the rabbis marveled at how the media reports which have traditionally placed a strong emphasis on statements from union officials and others who do not necessarily have personal knowledge of the situation actually differ from the situation that they observed during their mission
1640431 everybody spoke to all kinds of people on line in the lunchroom
1640432 what i saw there was not what i read friday morning in ohare airport that its a kosher jungle i saw a state of the art plant
1640433 i told these people im here to listen and to help
1640434 i was telling them that i sat at my desk on many occasions and heard this for many years when you hear the same thing over and over again you know it cant be fabricated and there has to be some substance to it
1640435 as of this moment the rabbis are awaiting documentation of the alleged abuses to workers of the agriprocessors plant
1640436 the plant theyre describing to me and the plant ive had workers describe to me is not same facility
1640437 we need a commission with incredible stature and with rabbis of great merit who can spend a few weeks or a month in postville and can make recommendations
1640438 i wish everybody would be treated like we treat people
1640439 these are simple people they are a family of butchers
1640440 they blame the media they blame us they refuse to accept responsibility for anything that is going on in that plant
1640441 we are god fearing people and we believe in the american system and we believe it will ultimately turn out ok
1640442 there is a story beyond the starving children with flies in their eyes beyond executions and genocide ours is a new and balanced agenda
1640443 we have no alternative we are intellectuals who have stepped on a landmine and we dont know when it is going to explode we must carry on because these young people need to learn we are ready to die for that this is my country and i have to help these innocent children they are the future of somalia
1640444 the description said advanced but if was very very very advanced
1640445 i was definately in the wrong session coz i am only a begginner in reflection and this was a 300 advanced session
1640446 the speaker was very well prepered thus did not strukkel to speak i understand the topic very well but still enjoyed the talk
1640447 sometimes he sounds more like borat than a knowledgeable speaker there were a number of sniggers in the audience at his comments which distracts from the content

1640468 the french support was of a political military diplomatic and logistic nature
1640469 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1640470 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1640471 considering the gravity of the alleged facts the rwandan government asks competent authorities to undertake all necessary actions to bring the accused french political and military leaders to answer for their acts before justice

1640475 real life math is talking about issues that matter around race and class and gender and sexuality and immigration and all of these things that have more of an impact on the students than people at first maybe imagine
1640476 we start with story telling then we talk about well how does that affect our students lives directly then we talked about statistics because what the statistics said depended on who was using them so we could look at the statistics that were produced by the police department and we could look at the statistics that were being used by the newspaper it was fascinating to see how with the exact same data they came to vastly different conclusions that was really important students came to understand that its important to question results that people get from mathematical data
1640477 think about your own experiences are you likely to achieve mastery over skills while youre falling asleep absolutely not
1640478 some educators say this is really the approach no matter where you go people in learning environments should be engaged politically in their direct experience so whether youre coming from a village in india where youre talking about access to clean water and who has control over that or from a foresting community in ireland where the rules have been set by players that are extremely powerful you should be taking that local context that is about power and privilege and asking students to be talking about it in the classroom when the students take part in the real world they will be able to understand what they are talking about and effect real change thats really the point of education that transformation happens in whatever community youre in
1640479 bringing social justice into the classroom makes students feel included and valued and safe when those things are met people are better able to learn what were really talking about is empathy when people feel safe and valued they are more likely to feel that others also need to be taken care of and that justice for others is important

1640493 to be someone kids look up to is a great honor what matters is how you carry yourself off and on the field people always say to me why would you place yourself in a position where you have to put pressure on yourself but its what gives me energy
1640494 people always ask me do you play golf because a majority of sportsmen do i used to play quite a few years ago but to be honest id rather spend 4 hours with the kids than 4 hours on a golf course as much as it can be relaxing its a frustrating sport my way of relaxing is listening to music and spending time with the kids
1640495 even if i had a great game hes always say you played well but these were the mistakes you made if i had a bad game id hear all about that when i was playing for manchester united playing something like 200 games and winning european cup finals he still wouldnt let me get away with saying ive made it so thats one thing i have never done and never will do

1640518 normalmente per montare una tavola da nuova ci impieghi al max 1 ora oggi ci sono volute almeno 3 ore questo significa fare le olimpiadi
1640519 stamattina mi sono allenata come tutti i giorni del resto oggi per solo 1 allenamento diversamente dagli altri dove ho fatto 2 allenamenti
1640520 sanno perfettamente qual il dovere morale cui adempiono nel momento in cui gareggiano

1640546 its age and the cost of travel and the cost of the olympic experience its so much more than we used to pay
1640547 i think that one of the premium sports events in the world is the olympics
1640548 ive really been a supporter of the olympic movement i think it does a lot of good to develop relationships between people and nations
1640549 the atmosphere and focus of the games has changed dramatically
1640550 the reason is cost and cost has brought in sponsorship the next thing is the advent of professional athletes its not pure at all like it used to be

1640581 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1640582 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1640583 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1640584 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1640585 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions
1640586 ultimately only china can decide what course it will follow
1640587 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1640588 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1640589 i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step

1640593 they are committed to helping north korea integrate into the international community and thereby partake in the peace and prosperity on the korean peninsula and in northeast asia
1640594 we will defeat the enemy overseas so we do not have to face them at home
1640595 we are not complacent however as there is still much to do tackling worklessness and raising aspirations remain amongst our key priorities

1640597 theres no better way to celebrate our terrible twos than with a big release like this
1640598 the only problem was choosing from among the literally hundreds of pages of great comics weve got on the site joe wanted only self contained stories though so while that unfortunately left out a lot of great stuff it helped me narrow it down are these the best 120 pages of comics ever to appear at the chemset no are they the 120 pages that fit together best as a book i think so
1640599 joe pruett has been an extraordinary supporter of the chemset virtually since its inception and no formula is just an outgrowth of that
1640600 at least half a dozen issues of negative burn have featured chemsetters and in july weve got the graphic novel blue diamond order code may083778 coming from elizabeth genco and sami makkonen who also have a short story together in no formula the relationship with desperado is something were thankful for and hope will continue to grow thus the perhaps optimistic vol 1 in the title for that to happen folks need to go out and buy the books though so please pre order your copies

1640603 while british attitudes are more egalitarian than in the 1980s there are signs that support for gender equality may have hit a high point some time during the 1990s
1640604 when it comes to the clash between work and family life doubts about whether a woman should be doing both are starting to creep in
1640605 attempts to shoehorn women into workplaces made by men for men have failed
1640606 women still shoulder the bulk of caring and housework at home the long working hours culture and lack of flexible working means women are presented with impossible choices forced to choose between caring for a family at home or maximising their career opportunities the result motherhood carries a penalty and women and men are straitjacketed by gender stereotypes
1640607 many mothers tell us that in the first year of a babys life they want to stay at home but often feel they have to return to work too early because of financial constraints we need to do more to help mothers and fathers by increasing well paid parental leave and changing how it can be shared between them
1640608 the results are even more extreme in the us where the percentage of people arguing that family life does not suffer if a woman works has plummeted from 51 in 1994 to 38 in 2002
1640609 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
1640610 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1640611 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1640612 in britain and the us however where support for equal opportunities for both sexes is much longer standing some people are now starting to have second thoughts
1640613 in most cases this appears to revolve around concerns that the welfare of children and of the family are being compromised the more women spend their time at work and find themselves lumbered with the double burden of employment and family care
1640614 we are still educating to confirm a gender role division that people thought was eradicated 25 years ago
1640615 at the moment in the uk we are heading in the wrong direction after a period when there was greater support at an ideological level for an equal division of labour
1640616 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
1640617 by making all roles flexible at every level ending the long working hours culture and challenging discriminatory attitudes women and men could participate in the workplace on an equal footing and live free from stereotypes about whose role it is to do the caring
1640618 when this happens business the economy and society as a whole will all reap the benefits
1640619 the british economy cannot afford not to have women in the workforce women make up 45 of employees in an age when we have significant skill shortages we cannot miss out on any part of the talent pool
1640620 our latest research shows 79 of organisations are struggling to recruit and 75 are struggling to retain skills they have to think how to address the need for more flexibility for women and men
1640621 a family does not suffer if a woman is in full time employment
1640622 it is the husbands job to earn income and the wifes to look after the children

1640634 the uaes decision to write off the iraqi debt is an expression of brotherhood and solidarity between the two countries it also aims to assist the iraqi government in the implementation of reconstruction plans and the rehabilitation of state institutions and various facilities
1640635 the restoration of security in iraq is the cornerstone in rehabilitation and resumption of its active regional and international roles
1640636 back their legitimate government and eschew sectarian violence to help iraq regain its stability and security
1640637 it reflects the fraternity between the peoples of uae and iraq the uaes decision to write off the debt will enhance the credit position of the iraqi economy and spur the restoration of security and stability
1640638 the news was sure to bolster government which has been urging iraqs sunni arab neighbors to forgive loans made during saddam husseins regime and restore diplomatic relations
1640639 iraq has been appealing for relief of at least 67 billion in foreign debt owed mostly to arab nations that have been reluctant to forgive iraqs belligerence during saddam husseins regime
1640640 we appreciate the emiratis recognition that a secure and prosperous iraq is in the interests of everyone in the region prime minister maliki and the government of iraq should also be applauded for their continued outreach to their neighbors and their efforts to advance a positive agenda through regional diplomacy
1640641 sunni militant groups like al qaida in iraq mistrustful of the government have warned arab states not to open embassies in baghdad
1640642 difficult to explain why diplomatic exchange has not taken place
1640643 papers that fill you with envy papers that both humiliate and inspire papers that are a showcase for what is possible in planning
1640644 dat betekent een aanzienlijke reductie van het wegtransport en we dragen hiermee ook de groene gedachte uit het scheelt heel wat co2 in de lucht
1640645 er is een folder in de maak die we op open monumentendag uitdelen we spelen met het idee aandelen uit te geven als tegenprestatie krijgen aandelenbezitters vaardagen met de nieuwe zorg ook kunnen we reclame maken voor bedrijven die ons sponsoren bovendien presenteren we ons in stijl met historische kostuums en een draaiorgel
1640646 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1640647 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1640648 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1640649 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1640650 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1640651 after the holiday season back to school is the most important shopping season of the year however a recent survey from deloitte found that during this back to school shopping season 71 percent of households plan on spending less on back to school items than they have in previous years with consumers feeling financial strain from higher gas and food prices live search cashback is offering back to school shoppers extra savings to stretch their dollars further
1640652 aleister crowleys legacy still poses problems for occultists especially when they take internet
1640653 if another occult author had that kind of notoriety would people read his works in the same way would the image influence how the content was perceived
1640654 hey its not fair that you assume that crowleys image influences my reading of his content
1640655 is occultism as a culture about image or content or is there a good balance for both
1640656 what does doing all of this stuff really do for me how is this really changing my life
1640657 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1640658 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1640659 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1640660 i guarantee you that my contract will be like no other
1640661 it will be a ground breaking record contract for sure without a doubt theres so much money to be made right now in mixed martial arts and its all about the fighters trying to make that money its going to be a long term deal where i put my heart and soul into the company and help build them thats something im interested in doing theyre going to bring me on not just as a fighter but also doing some of the back work also
1640662 nemmeno io firmer perch sono il sindaco di venezia e non il segretario del pd della mia citt ma a parte questo mi sembra uniniziativa sballata
1640663 il problema oggi del partito democratico quello di organizzare se stesso e non di dare una spallata al governo che significherebbe frantumarsi la spalla perci non firmo assolutamente no
1640664 sarebbe il caso di concentrare gli sforzi per avere mezzi di comunicazione pi efficienti di quelli attuali
1640665 non penso bene mi pare ovvio anzi uno specchio del fatto che certamente nel partito democratico ci sono diverse correnti usiamo pure questa parola cos come ci sono state in tutti i partiti ivi compreso il partito comunista italiano solo che non cerano tanti organi di stampa
1640666 ha il dovere di collaborare con il governo ma anche il dovere di contrastare le scelte dannose del governo
1640667 leggo che il presidente della campania chiede a gran voce il congresso anticipato del pd e dice che non firmer la petizione buon per lui che ha sempre le idee chiare sa sempre da che parte stare e che ha dimostrato in tutti questi anni di saper costruire un gran partito di popolo radicato di massa senza macchia e senza paura
1640668 la domanda sorge spontanea se veltroni e bettini non sono riusciti a convincere neanche bassolino sulla bont della loro inutile petizione antigovernativa come pensano di poter convincere 57 milioni di italiani
1640669 pi morti sul lavoro o sulle strade che per omicidio
1640670 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1640671 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
1640672 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
1640673 there is nothing to indicate its anything other than a random and unprovoked attack
1640674 the whole time i seen him he never took off his sunglasses
1640675 he said there was something about this guy that made the hair on the back of his neck stand up
1640676 darrens a treaty indian when darren gets nervous about somebody i listen
1640677 i just thought he was a guy having a hard time
1640678 he seemed lost as i was talking to him about the laptop he muttered something about america he had a thick accent so it was hard to understand
1640679 he seemed really happy to get some money in his hand
1640680 todays investment is about making the banff trans canada highway a more reliable drive for everybody
1640681 residents and visitors alike know this to be one of the most beautiful drives in the world they also deserve for it to be one of the safest
1640682 fencing of the new sections when theyre complete and the overpass and underpass structures for wildlife will improve mobility of the animals from one side of the valley to the other
1640683 we were doing trials since the middle of last year and concluded first quarter this year we have tested in densely populated cities
1640684 we will keep on expanding the service to cover as many urban areas possible
1640685 whether our customers move to 3g or wimax thats okay for us
1640686 wimax though is a purpose built network and is located nearer to residential rather than commercial areas
1640687 only the indo canadians are being treated differently this is not right
1640688 im not into politics i dont understand why they did this in our e mails though we were very clear
1640689 for their own reasons have chosen to make controversy out of this which is unfortunate
1640690 we felt it would be most appropriate for this expression to be made in a venue where the broader community could participate which is what the prime minster did
1640691 this was a single incident that affected about 350 non canadians of some 90 years ago were mindful that each of these are different and unique historical experiences
1640692 many governments have come and gone since 1914 it is your government that has shown courage and commitment in addressing this dark chapter in our history the community is looking forward to an apology in a sincere and respectful manner to write this final chapter in parliament the indo canadians are very grateful of your honest dedication and new approach and we look forward to an apology only in the house of commons
1640693 i have spoken with the team here in ottawa regarding the event everyone seems to be in agreement as to the proposed programme we went over minister kenney would give brief remarks and introduce the prime minister the prime minister would then give his remarks and be thanked by the president of the mohan singh memorial foundation sahib thind
1640694 the required two thirds vote of the senate is only 15 senators so we only need one more vote that wont be hard because the issue of constitutionality has already been settled
1640695 the result of the exchange of notes will be that all philippine constitutional provisions reserving certain economic activities to filipinos and to corporations 60 percent filipino owned shall prevail over jpepa
1640696 an exchange of notes in effect constitutes a treaty in itself provided it states that the exchange shall have that effect
1640697 our national patrimony and natural resources will remain safely in filipino hands
1640698 what i saw was probably the worst thing ive seen in 20 years of policing the worst
1640699 there are indications that there may be a history of abuse
1640700 there certainly may be questions that need to be answered
1640701 hindi naman siguro dapat tulong tulong lahat ng pilipino i dont think so all filipinos should help out to give peace a chance lets not talk about war and arming our people
1640702 there must be peace in mindanao for development to come in thats why we are calling for sobriety
1640703 to determine legislative measures that would need to be undertaken as proposed in the agreement
1640704 the moa itself says that there may be a need to amend the existing legal framework of the philippines in order to put into effect the provisions of the moa and the eventual final peace agreement
1640705 who is supposed to do the amendments isnt that the job of congress so it is just proper that congress should scrutinize this moa
1640706 the congress is peoples representation as prescribed by the constitution the people have a right to be heard and to ask questions through congress
1640707 impaired driving driving with blood alcohol content over 08 and dangerous driving
1640708 we just heard a loud bang and somebody yelling screaming my head my head and then we saw flames in the ravine
1640709 what were left with is two people on the road and one decides his car is better than the other they either accelerate down the road or leave a stop sign together or just decide im going to get there before he does somebody runs out of control and you get a tragic consequence
1640710 in the past two years weve purchased 12 covert vehicles that are out on the road to deal specifically with aggressive drivers and you wont be able to tell them apart from the soccer moms or the drug dealers
1640711 there are so many things you juggle at the same time yoga is something consistent that lets me calm down
1640712 its the higher doses of these drugs that are normally associated with their effects as stimulants those that increase locomotor activity impair cognition and target neurotransmitters all over the brain
1640713 these lower doses are diametrically opposed to that instead they help the pfc better do what its supposed to do
1640714 similar to listening to a choir you can understand the music by listening to individual voices
1640715 or you can listen to the interplay between the voices of the ensemble and how the different voices combine
1640716 this suggests that the therapeutic effects of ritalin likely stem from this fine tuning of pfc sensitivity
1640717 youre improving the ability of these neurons to respond to behaviorally relevant signals and that translates into better cognition attention and working memory
1640718 these results show a new level of action for cognition enhancing doses of ritalin that couldnt have been predicted from single neuron analyses
1640719 so if youre searching for drugs that might replace ritalin this is one effect you could potentially look for
1640720 most studies look at how something that impairs cognition affects pfc neurons but to really understand how neurons encode cognitive function you want to see what neurons do when cognition is improved
1640721 so this work sets the stage for examining the interplay among pfc neurons higher cognition and the action of therapeutic drugs
1640722 opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1640723 once he gets going the best laid plans of men and mice come to naught
1640724 unreservedly he surrenders to the present moment heedless of the past or future it is the perfect moment pure present pure loss suspended between yesterday and tomorrow he gives of himself generously and devotes himself to today since he has no fear of displeasure his daring knows no bounds since he has nothing to lose everything is his
1640725 happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes
1640726 im happy that the podium covers me from the waist down
1640727 but other countries also need to learn it is the same for the outside world for a long time there was a lack of communication so there are a lot of clich s about china that are outdated
1640728 if its this bad when only half the cars are on the road just imagine what it must be normally
1640729 when there is a colloquial understanding of a word we can take this into account when reaching our decision in this case we believe that most viewers are likely to understand the term organic as meaning no man made chemicals have been used to manufacture or are present in this product for this reason we believe that most viewers are unlikely to be misled by the claim
1640730 the superior mastery of images and pictures in grasping the attention
1640731 the cage of his ribs all astir the bones of his arms waving
1640732 their reading being as the sand it runs in and runs out and leaves not a vestige behind
1640733 unless companies eliminate all hazardous chemicals from their electronic products and take responsibility for the entire life cycle of their products this poisonous dumping will continue
1640734 electronics companies must not allow their products to end up poisoning the poor around the world
1640735 lazy and ridiculous stereotype the idea that we are all po faced hair shirted posh people is ridiculous
1640736 i went to a public school stowe in another life i will endeavour to be born to a different set of parents
1640737 i have done some bad things but i have always boasted about them afterwards
1640738 here is a woman who owns 20 times as much as i do and she slags me off for being rich
1640739 why do i write about myself this is a question people often ask me
1640740 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1640741 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1640742 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1640743 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1640744 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1640745 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1640746 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1640747 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1640748 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1640749 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1640750 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1640751 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1640752 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1640753 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1640754 i hope this brings you the closure that you seek
1640755 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1640756 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1640757 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1640758 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1640759 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1640760 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1640761 achamos que a stasi uma p gina da hist ria que temos que virar definitivamente por isso consideramos que temos direito agora de tamb m poder rir disso tudo e fizemos essa brincadeira
1640762 depois fui comprando os objetos para decora o nos leil es do ebay
1640763 foi o modo que encontrei para dar um diferencial e atrair uma clientela melhor numa regi o onde os pequenos bares competem nos pre os
1640764 uma id ia dif cil de superar em termos de mau gosto
1640765 para os que conheceram as pr ticas perversas da stasi visitando o museu dedicado organiza o a cerveja desse bar certamente n o vai descer bem
1640766 fa o um apelo aos propriet rios que abram m o desse mau gosto e pe o sociedade que ignore o estabelecimento
1640767 quem tem humor sabe que o bar traz um tom de cr tica n o estamos querendo fazer daqui um ponto de encontro para antigos espi es comunistas ou coisa parecida
1640768 angustiante ouvir uma crian a dizendo isso se era a madeleine uma desgra a que a informa o n o tenha sido passada
1640769 n s agora precisamos saber o que foi feito disso este exatamente o tipo de informa o prim ria que precisamos saber se foi propriamente seguida pela pol cia
1640770 esse o tipo de informa o que os detetives particulares v o investigar caso n o tenha sido seguida pela pol cia
1640771 esses jogos ol mpicos t m sido bom para os neg cios j notamos que h mais gente comprando aqui desde o come o da semana

1640796 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1640797 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1640798 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
1640799 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face

1640832 note that the dollars strength is not owed to the us economys robustness but rather due to the fact that other major economies are faring worse solid us macro fundamentals will be necessary for the dollar to retain long term support
1640833 i feel very excited and very proud because the olympic games is a 100 year dream of chinas
1640834 we did this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool
1640835 the conditions are not unfavorable at the moment and my understanding is that we are not going to be taking any extra measures
1640836 i have got to the point where this is just farcical and simply unfair on the athletes who are clean and get there on their own merit
1640837 i have no doubts that when i line up next week i will look left and right and know the other girls arent all clean
1640838 that is such a disgrace and ive lost all faith in the system because there are so many athletes who are slipping under the radar
1640839 thats not sport its plain cheating and we need to be vigilant in nailing those who cross the line
1640840 its a joke and again ive lost count of what ive missed out on because of drug cheats
1640841 he vice governor pi ol said they would arm themselves and harness any arms we could get
1640842 i dont know if he was joking i dont know pero ang sabi niya sa akin pare kapag na tro kami diyan sa signing ng moa bahala na kayo sa sarili ko he told me that if we are stopped from signing the moa by a tro you will be left to fend for yourselves
1640843 we are not going to sacrifice the lives of our soldiers to defend you we will not sacrifice them these were esperons words or words to that effect
1640844 nasasaktan galit ang mga tao sa mindanao the people of mindanao are being hurt now the muslims are also enraged at the government parang binalewala nila yung temperament they have disregarded the temperament of the people
1640845 local officials are demanding for reinforcements but no military forces have arrived
1640846 there is no policy restraining the military organization to defend the filipino people from any threat regardless of his creed political belief and ideological position
1640847 we assure our brothers in north cotabato and all our countrymen that your armed forces is capable and aptly equipped to address the threats besetting them
1640848 today world oil prices have gone down from 140 to 118 we are now calling on oil companies to please pass on to consumers the reduction in oil prices

1640850 if he can pitch like the last time out it will be very interesting
1640851 he was pretty cool and calm out there in his debut and tonight should be easier for him he had a lot going on that day his debut
1640852 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1640853 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1640854 we have an indisputable international law obligation that conflicts with state law
1640855 the supreme court has ruled the president has neither the constitutional power nor the legislative authority to overturn the state rules
1640856 its silence is no surprise the united states has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access
1640857 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case
1640858 there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jose medellins execution goes forward
1640859 for the precedent it could set for the rights of mexican nationals that could be detained
1640860 a delay in startup to spring 09 would likely result in fairly material short term underperformance
1640861 like most things the japanese imported the idea from another culture and have taken it to the extreme

1640865 that you can simply enjoy with your everyday meals and share with your family and friends
1640866 it is amazing how a creature so fragile can achieve such immeasurable superiority
1640867 examining the nonprofit capital market the integrated challenges of performance measurement scale and sustainability
1640868 we ask them not to be democrats and republicans for a few days
1640869 there needs to be a distinction between whether he or she posted a question or just visited the web site
1640870 we would consider kicking current students out or rescinding admission offers for alumni we would definitely consider revoking degrees in our business its something that we are prepared to do because there could be similar situations in the future
1640871 in a holding pattern until we have actual evidence that someone has cheated
1640872 we could prevent them from being admitted if theyre prospective students another option for current students would be to prevent them from graduating im not sure what wed do about alumni
1640873 in the event that we learn of individuals who have violated the gmac testing policies the penalty would be consistent with that which would apply to anyone who has lied or cheated to gain an advantage either in the admission process or as a student at fuqua
1640874 range from suspension to expulsion to revocation of a degree depending on the infraction
1640875 we wouldnt enroll someone who had knowingly cheated but at this point its difficult to pinpoint whos guilty and whos not so were leaving it up to the officials and the legal team at gmac
1640876 the way i look at it the moa is violative of the provisions of the present constitution
1640877 at least i think we should have been extended the courtesy of being consulted prior to finalization of the draft
1640878 if they overextended their understanding of an autonomous region thats another thing
1640879 my headmaster sent me home last week because i hadnt paid the school fees
1640880 im looking in the computers for copper and iron which i can sell to pay the fees
1640881 chemicals like lead are very dangerous especially for children they affect the brain when it is developing and therefore cause a lower iq when they grow up
1640882 other chemicals we found cause cancer or disrupt your hormone system
1640883 my research shows that about 90 of the computers are just junk they just dont work this is dumping
1640884 about 10 are put to good use the rest go straight to agbobloshie dump site and other dumps around the country where they contaminate ground water surface water the rivers and the streams and they all end up in the sea and thats where we get all the fish
1640885 i am delighted with the opportunity to play in europe and hopefully i will settle in well and get going straight away
1640886 i am looking forward to playing regularly and scoring goals for the side
1640887 i had a good time at celtic and made friends which made the decision to leave difficult but for the sake of progress in my career it had to happen
1640888 this new development is significant because the measure has now been approved by no less than three standing committees of the house of representatives the committees on health population and family relations and appropriations
1640889 i love it here and i want to be part of the team so im happy to have signed my new contract
1640890 ive said from day one that i love the club and i want to do more for the club
1640891 i want to do well for the fans theyre the best supporters in the premier league like the 12th man
1640892 the conditions are really tough with the pollution and its really hot we dont have too many days to adapt so i hope to be much better than today
1640893 it is very hot and very humid and the sun isnt even out yet so im sure it will probably only get worse from here
1640894 it is unpredictable and probably the hottest conditions we are going to play in all year
1640895 ive been in china seven or eight times im very used to playing in the heat and experiencing the thick air
1640896 tennis players are used to experiencing so many things its just something that you have to get on board with and work around
1640897 i had a hit out there today the smog didnt worry me i think the heat and humidity will cause more of a problem but i like to play in these conditions
1640898 we already just came from cincinnati but here its really hot its really humid
1640899 because the weather in spain is so hot i think the spanish players will be in better condition physically and that will be an advantage
1640900 todays price actions in asian foreign exchange markets reflect the response to lower oil prices the us fed action and the firm us dollar tone
1640901 those who responded favorably to lower oil prices are the peso the rupee and the won while those who remain sensitized to the firm us dollar tone are the taiwan dollar the singapore dollar and the ringgit
1640902 the philippine central bank may have been somewhat belated in starting its hiking cycle but it is surely trying to make up for that fact with fairly aggressive rate hikes now
1640903 the spot dollar rupiah is still heavy and todays government bond auction will drag further rupiah inflows
1640904 with oil prices falling the global economic picture is now changing were seeing a better investment climate
1640905 the big rally in the united states and other overseas markets
1640906 the main catalyst has been the oil price it has dropped quite a bit in the last two weeks
1640907 the market is always forward looking while inflation may have passed the consensus forecast in july if oil goes down then the inflationary pressures will ease that is why the market is going up
1640908 he came here last season and has done very well so hopefully he can score the goals again this time
1640909 but we have to create the chances for him he doesnt miss that many so with yak you know that if he gets his chance hell score one out of every two
1640910 when he first came here he struggled a little bit because the everton team work really hard and its a big part of our game i told him that from the beginning
1640911 ive had two good seasons but youve got to keep challenging yourself as a player to keep progressing and hopefully this season i can push on again
1640912 playing in europe is a big boost to everyone at villa but it also means you are playing against different systems and players which presents a challenge in itself
1640913 you play against quality players in the premier league but europe will be different again
1640914 improvements in top line growth expected in second half however full year growth outlook at low single digit rate
1640915 o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth thou art the ruins of the noblest man woe to the hand that shed this costly blood which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue domestic fury and fierce civil strife
1640916 we were in south korea for two weeks and we prepared very hard we played two friendly matches which i believe has exposed the girls further we won the first match 5 1 against one of their clubs and won the second one 1 0
1640917 on the 27th of july we played the china olympic team and we were held to a 2 2 draw they even had to score their equaliser very late in the match
1640918 all these show that our team is doing well and the girls are in good shape they are also high in spirits and in top form all the officials are in high spirits too and the camp is bubbling
1640919 i want to be cautious we want to take every match as they come we have played korea twice already losing one and winning one
1640920 this time we are going to do everything possible to win and we are leaving no stone unturned i want to assure you that if they are fast we are fast if they are tireless we are equally tireless
1640921 whatever they want to do we will do in return they can bring all their tricks and we will counter it to ensure our victory
1640922 mtawali has shown a lot of promise during his short spell with the and we want to groom him so that we can have a pool of highly qualified coaches
1640923 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1640924 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1640925 of course my good friend the vice president will be there
1640926 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1640927 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1640928 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1640929 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1640930 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
1640931 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1640932 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1640933 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1640934 days before the olympic games begin and as all eyes turn to china we appeal to the world to remember that millions of tibetans are crying out for human rights and freedom
1640935 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1640936 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1640937 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1640938 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1640939 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1640940 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1640941 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1640942 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1640943 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1640944 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1640945 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1640946 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1640947 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1640948 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1640949 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1640950 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1640951 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1640952 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1640953 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1640954 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1640955 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1640956 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1640957 our customers asked for in flight connectivity and were responding by rolling out the most extensive wi fi network in the sky
1640958 sen obama has said expanding our nuclear power plants quote doesnt make sense for america unquote
1640959 he also says no to nuclear storage and no to nuclear processing i could not disagree more
1640960 supports safe and secure nuclear energy however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered obama thinks key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
1640961 i saw sen obamas latest attack has to do with oil and campaign contributions
1640962 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it sen obama voted for it people care not only what you say but how you vote
1640963 we talked about everything that has happened since this whole process started
1640964 we rehashed all the different things thats gone on we agreed and disagreed our whole focus was was he a member of our football team and where was his mind at he was not at the proper mindset to be part of our football team
1640965 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1640966 i understand the attention he gets for being in his position i think that he has the tools mentally physically emotionally whos had better training than aaron rodgers in being an nfl qb i believe in aaron because hes very talented
1640967 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1640968 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1640969 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1640970 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1640971 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1640972 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1640973 everything went kind of sour a few weeks or a month back but you never felt like it would get to the point or to the talks of him actually being traded
1640974 i felt once he stepped back in here he would be the quarterback him not being here today i guess management has a different route so at that point weve got to go out and do our job
1640975 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1640976 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1640977 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1640978 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1640979 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1640980 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1640981 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1640982 who are open to doing something on the production side
1640983 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1640984 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1640985 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1640986 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

1641018 when i make something the first time i follow the recipe
1641019 when i cook my friends my daughters bev and i will sit down to a nice meal we might sit down a little later like asking folks to come at 6 and sitting down to dinner at 7 30 but thats what appetizers are for
1641020 during the 28 years i served in the legislature 22 as a representative and six years as state senator for senate district 4 i never cooked when we were in session in jefferson city we always had a kitchen but when your day begins at 6 or 7 a m and ends past midnight theres no time to shop let alone cook
1641021 my mom cooked comfort foods like pot roasts fried chicken and ham i remember she used this terra cotta pot only and always for potato salad i guess i started learning watching her im the oldest of four boys
1641022 my dads specialty was creamed chipped beef on toast s o s and barbecue the fork i use to carve it looks odd kind of bent but it was my dads and i like to use it
1641023 my mom through changed circumstance raised us by herself my parents always told us to leave the world a better place than we found it ive always taken that to heart my younger brother kids me saying i dont remember them saying that i tell him they must have only told me
1641024 i really like using my pressure cooker but struggle with rice recipes
1641025 i have tried using a flame tamer without any luck anyone have any tips or tricks
1641026 s ince the day i discovered taken in hand is a necessary read very complex lots of power shifts combining respect with pain and pleasure domination roles submissive roles the whole shebang im glad i found it
1641027 first of all all you guys should check out this website articles very valuable insights im taken by this site
1641028 u ntil 2 days ago i thought i was a crazy abnormal taken in hand website i have never felt such relief such internal peace in my life this whole idea of being loved and trusting enough in another to place my his and our well being into his hands was exactly what i have been searching for my whole life i spent 16 hours just reading it is like a huge weight has lifted off my shoulders
1641029 there are lots of websites for people in the bdsm d s dd domestic discipline and spanking communities there are websites for people who belong to religions that advocate male head of household marriage there are even websites for christians who are interested in bdsm but there are very few websites for people who are interested in male led intimate relationships but who are not interested in all that the above communities associate with this kind of relationship jargon clothes etc some of us dont even like thinking of this as a lifestyle if you are interested in this kind of relationship but are not interested in bdsm or d s or dd or spanking websites theres a new website for you taken in hand is really the most beautiful website devoted to dd
1641030 t he whole damn site really is one of the most well articulated pro con loaded blogs ive seen it provides a cross section of how people are feeling out there even amongst those who are seemingly natural allies
1641031 as i view it im a control freak i love to be in control however i fantasize about that control being stripped from me and handed over to someone else namely my husband im just glad i found a site that makes me realize im not a freak for wanting to be dominated
1641032 thank you for providing such a positive validating place for like minded people to talk about this in a way that affirms the dignity of both men and women
1641033 finally a lot of developers are not writing new code they are maintaining old code whether its written by them or other people that is not testable anyway
1641034 its two hours of really wonderful skill and of sophisticated youth performers really having a good time with what they are great at
1641035 if people think youth circus and they are unsure they should definitely be sure because they put out a ton of energy and put on something really amazing its hard to describe the show because part of me doesnt want to give it away
1641036 its basically if dr seuss wrote a science themed book
1641037 one of the really wonderful things for us is that they are a nonprofit but that they do these shows so that other organizations can raise money too
1641038 its really become a community were not just good friends were like a family
1641039 it really is most important for safety reasons that it the track is constructed properly in its current state its a pretty good facility but one that will never see high rates of usage
1641040 it think the community would really see the benefit of the track if council undertook the works which then have to be followed up by regular maintenance
1641041 that doesnt take a huge amount of effort if the job has been done right in the first place
1641042 it would be more sensible to do it now before the other infrastructure is in place in preparation for the increased number of young people in that precinct
1641043 people say the track isnt being used and thats correct to an extent because people really cant use it with how it is at the moment
1641044 i couldnt believe it when i found out i was pregnant my boys are 20 and 21 and im a grandmother i told the doctor to check it again
1641045 i was hysterical by the time i got home and told my husband steven
1641046 i had been grieving over the death of my father so didnt think i was pregnant our beautiful baby was born on the anniversary of dads death she was a gift from him
1641047 i gave up both times with the boys after just a couple of weeks because i thought i didnt have enough milk
1641048 it is possible for women to return to work and it is an issue that worries many mothers and perhaps influences their decision on whether or not to continue breastfeeding
1641049 it is possible for mothers to continue to feed and we can provide the kind of information and support that may allow that to happen
1641050 we would like to be able to do more in terms of facilitating access for socialisation and group activities but we are only able to cover the bare minimum at the moment
1641051 awake from their slumber and realise the growing demand for the community transport service
1641052 it continues to amaze me how these community organisations have managed to stretch every funding dollar they are good at it now because they have been forced too
1641053 theres no doubt that what would be considered a modest funding boost in sydney terms would have a huge impact on regional community like orange
1641054 to be honest in the past we didnt get any relocations that we were able to identify as a result of our attendance
1641055 there is a huge array of costs associated with the expo and we already have existing prominence in sydney through our partnership with taste orange bondi and other consumer expos so council made the decision not to attend this years event
1641056 if an apple grower is getting 1 20 per kilogram for his fruit and the supermarket price is 5 6kg questions can be asked
1641057 weve made progress on the establishment of our website and have had 72 per cent of horticultural farmer members of nswf support the concept
1641058 so enthusiastic are our nsw growers to get the site up and running quickly other states have recognised growers can put themselves in a position to do something positive
1641059 once weve got a national site for consumers of fruit and vegetables to check prices we think theres a better chance the government might have another look at it because nothing can be achieved without federal government intervention
1641060 more than just offering jobs newcrest is offering you a future
1641061 i know that the jersey was worn by legends who have contributed immensely to the club in the past i am going to work very hard because i dont want to disappoint them as they expect a lot from me
1641062 vilakazi is the ideal player to wear the jersey because of his good leadership qualities and desire to win he brings hope and quality to the club and there is no doubt about his immense qualities i am convinced that he is the ideal player to wear the jersey
1641063 if they dont manage it phil scolari could be out of work come may
1641064 i see people are getting a little too excited chelsea wont be storming any league theyll be up there with united but will finish 2nd
1641065 find where you were born on a map stick in a pin with a piece of string attached then find the nearest professional football club to the pin thats the club you support
1641066 lets face it if ronaldo hadnt had that extraordinary season last year wed be talking about chelseas title defence now
1641067 i want to make chelsea loved around the world like barcelona and manchester united its a surprise when people say chelsea are unpopular because when we went to china they cried for chelsea they loved chelsea its a big surprise people dont like us in england
1641068 under private property each tries to establish over the other an alien power so as thereby to find satisfaction of his own selfish need the increase in the quantity of objects is therefore accompanied by an extension of the realm of the alien powers to which man is subjected and every new product represents a new potentiality of mutual swindling and mutual plundering
1641069 our mutual value is for us the value of our mutual objects hence for us man himself is mutually of no value
1641070 last time i was there we lost one nil in a result that chelsea were a tad fortunate to win it was like a morgue exiting the stadium that day
1641071 chelsea and liverpool are the clearest most exaggerated example of the way football is going very intense very collective very tactical very physical and very direct but a short pass noooo a feint noooo a change of pace noooo a one two a nutmeg a backheel dont be ridiculous none of that if football is going the way chelsea and liverpool are taking it we had better be ready to wave goodbye to any expression of the cleverness and talent we have enjoyed for a century football is made up of subjective feeling of suggestion in that anfield is unbeatable put a sh t hanging from a stick in the middle of this passionate crazy stadium and there are people who will tell you its a work of art its not its a sh t hanging from a stick
1641072 chelsea will never be loved and havent been for decades
1641073 you say chelsea havent strengthened in the right areas but surely the addition og botswinga is a welcome solution to the right back area
1641074 its always sad that problems continue to rock our sports the biggest problem for now is even in the sports commission where there is a lot of disharmony
1641075 many american hospitals are taking it upon themselves to repatriate seriously injured or ill immigrants
1641076 heroes like my deceased friends rwamuhanda peter and ayaa judith made uganda proud unfortunately they died miserable yet uoc could have given them a helping hand
1641077 i have moved to iten kenya to train for the remaining days i will get a chance of studying their kenyan athletes tactics and should surely deny them a clean sweep
1641078 each time we get to the pitch we have a point already its always a matter of looking for the two extra points and thats what well continue doing
1641079 magogo has done well given where we gtv found football with politics involved to do a flawless job is almost a miracle
1641080 it is true we have a majority sponsor for the awards night it is a very positive thing for us in such a small time we are happy sponsors can trust us to do things
1641081 we are lucky that there has not been any major hiccup requiring funds so far government was still processing the money by the time we left
1641082 of course we want to win a gold medal thats what we come here for
1641083 our middle and long distance runners are most likely to win the medal
1641084 after the grace period we will support whatever the government decides to do with foreigners who are still in the state
1641085 since the various departments are computerized im sure this can be done
1641086 the workers who are now on the verge of starvation have been living in cramped accommodation without electricity and water for several days
1641087 power and water supply have not been restored to the labor camp which is in the far flung azizia district of riyadh this is because the company has not paid the bills
1641088 some of them approached the labor court and obtained favorable orders but the company is not even complying with the courts instructions
1641089 the time to act is now and we should address this problem with foresight and political will
1641090 strengthening the philippines institutional capacity to adapt to climate change
1641091 the program is timely given the worldwide effects now being felt from global warming and climate change
1641092 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1641093 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1641094 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1641095 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1641096 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1641097 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1641098 while its clear there is benefit to a significant number of men its equally clear that many men end up being diagnosed and treated for cancers that would likely not have caused them any significant harm
1641099 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1641100 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1641101 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1641102 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1641103 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1641104 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1641105 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1641106 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1641107 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1641108 i am not a racist ive never made a racist comment and i didnt attack obama personally
1641109 played the race card and played it from the bottom of the deck
1641110 im honoured to be involved in such an innovative project not only is it a great interactive way for young people to learn about such an important issue it also allows them to think about it from different perspectives
1641111 i believe that its everyones duty to be involved in this fight
1641112 why when the risks are known are young people still having unsafe sex

1641142 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america this is the moment as nancy pelosi noted that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1641143 my opponent is an honorable man i admire his service to our country but his vision of the future is more of the same hes running for george bushs third term
1641144 mccain is the fading celebrity who turned his vietnam imprisonment into a series of best selling books a second marriage to a pretty young beer heiress a tv bio pic and a lucrative three decade career in congress that led to his current starring role as the gop nominee for president so what does his campaign choose as an issue the popularity of his much younger more talented political opponent barack obama
1641145 three former pows told me mccain was ordered to turn his release down

1641147 now that the u s has worked through the first wave of subprime mortgage defaults we can all look forward to the inevitable tsunami of prime mortgage defaults
1641148 while it is difficult to draw precise parallels among various segments of the mortgage market the arc of the crisis in subprime loans suggests that the problems in the broader market may not peak for another year or two analysts said
1641149 we have to pay less for imported goods but its very bad for production as we generate our revenues in euros
1641150 we had incorporated these economic tendencies into our plans when we were making them

1641153 it opens up a whole new can of worms because its crossing international borders
1641154 which countrys courts are going to police a scenario where for example an australian breaches the privacy of someone in china the problem it is that globalisation has blurred international boundaries and the law hasnt caught up with these new technologies
1641155 ive had a look at it and you can just about see into peoples backyards i certainly dont want people seeing what i am doing in my backyard and i dont think others probably would either there is no solution beyond banning it and that doesnt work because it creates a black market

1641161 the previous three years have taught us that there is no substitute for top quality speakers from local chinese brands its important to strike the right mix with international speakers of course but nobody has a deeper understanding of the chinese consumer than our local speakers

1641180 if you wanted to see a bunch of women sitting around talking about issues and going on demonstrations are that are peaceful and non violent then so be it but i dont think there was a reason to do that
1641181 whats radical about equal pay for equal work and trying to empower women to reach the potential that they have
1641182 i think there had to be a lot of fear back then when you would see women get together to discuss these issues and maybe a lack of understanding comes to mind about what it was all about
1641183 all of those songs would have been sung at rallies demonstrations or meetings that we attended

1641202 fodava seeks to put an improved science base under one portion of the problem how can we transform large complex data sets into reduced computational models or mathematical formalisms that retain the information content while better supporting the human in extracting critical information from the data
1641203 scientific advances here are critical to future advances in the science of data and visual analytics that will keep us safe and provide technological and commercial advances that benefit mankind

1641214 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1641215 they have got to show a verification regime that we can trust
1641216 you can verifiably do what you say youre going to do or you continue to be the most sanctioned regime in the world

1641233 desire to be known for a perverted form of sexuality
1641234 the act of sodomy is a grave offence to every bible believer who in accepting the pure message of gods precious word express the mind of god by declaring it to be an abomination
1641235 this parade is not a welcome addition to our city neither is it a positive celebration of a profitable lifestyle flaunting a form of sexuality that generations of men and women have righteously resisted and by gods grace will continue to resist
1641236 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing innocent children
1641237 there must be sufficient confidence that the community has the best possible protection against such perverts

1641256 tipo aqueles do rambo que o markl descreve na sua cr nica de r dio
1641257 this decision does not affect the eligibility status of the players who have been validly entered by their national olympic committee and who remain fully eligible to compete
1641258 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1641259 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games
1641260 the olympic football tournaments are a unique opportunity for a player as they are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1641261 i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1641262 from what ive been told from the hotel the public security bureau showed up at midnight and told them our specific event had to be canceled for safety reasons without going into any specifics
1641263 when i arrived at 8 a m there were public security officials in the press conference room we had booked
1641264 amanda didnt want her voice to be silenced so we went ahead and arranged something else we never knew if we were going to be stopped at any point

1641274 i believe i can win and walk away with a medal and make finals in every competition i go to
1641275 its just the fact that i know every time i go up to do a routine or any event im quite confident ill make it back then i was just hoping to get through and i didnt really know what was going to come of it but now its just experience and being comfortable with myself ive taken off since then its just experience ive competed so many times and im just confident in myself now
1641276 ever since 2005 ive been medalling on floor and its all pretty much the same guys who are on top i know if i go out and try as hard as i can i can make the finals for sure the main thing for me is just sticking those landings and not taking too big of a landing deduction
1641277 i have no idea ive been to a few world championships now so im sure i can perform the way i want to perform the main thing is not to get too nervous and caught up in the whole thing

1641284 in so far as the postponement of the armm elections we can no longer postpone because the senate is not moving
1641285 we hope we can ask the plenary to come to a vote but we are not of course sure whether we would be able to pass this on second reading
1641286 but we will do our best based on best efforts principle because we know we understand the present situation that even if we pass this on third reading nothing will happen to this bill because nothing is moving in the senate

1641377 the media seems preoccupied at the moment about peoples dna being stored centrally but the reality is that the database is really a one dimensional invasion of citizens privacy
1641378 not only do you have the numbers called and the locations called from but you have a time based diary from which you can extrapolate their movements
1641379 this has been a highly charged subject for years not least due to the progressive extension of the scope of the database culminating in recent proposals to include young children who might offend in the future or indeed everyone in the country
1641380 ninety per cent of over six trillion business emails this year will be spam

1641392 giv ing unto his servants in their weakness after the manner of their language that they might come to understanding
1641393 it doesnt fit much with what is written and joseph smith seems to have held pretty strongly to the idea not just as a person but also as a prophet from what i can tell
1641394 this new license allows us to attempt to make human pig clones to produce embryonic stem cells
1641395 we will take skin cells from patients who have a mutation for certain kinds of heart disease cardiomyopathy which makes the heart lose its pumping strength and put them into pig eggs after their chromosomes have been removed
1641396 ultimately they will help us to understand where some of the problems associated with these diseases arise and they could also provide models for the pharmaceutical industry to test new drugs we will effectively be creating and studying these diseases in a dish
1641397 but its important to say that were at the very early stages of this research and it will take a considerable amount of time there is still a great deal to learn about these techniques and much of our early work will involve understanding how we can make the hybrid cloning process as efficient as possible
1641398 the key thing we are doing is trying to create stem cells without any animal mitochondria in them so even though these hybrid embryos normally have animal mitochondria we are hoping to create hybrid embryo cells that would have human chromosomes as well human mitochondrial dna
1641399 mixing of these two diverse populations of mitochondria can be detrimental to cellular function
1641400 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves

1641416 all church members are free to vote for whomever they wish
1641417 as a practical matter we think the initiative covers everything but we want to protect people five or ten years down the line we dont know what the creative pornographers might think up
1641418 there is a local election coming up on moral issue xyz please go out and vote
1641419 of course if you can point to a single individual who was thanked by a member of the first presidency for contacting their senator in opposition to the proposed amendment ill gladly consider myself refuted
1641420 if we wish to protect the rights of 19 year old lds missionaries to proselyte in public we must likewise protect the rights of pornographers the moment we endeavor to restrict the rights of others to do what we dont approve of we endanger our own right to do those things we do approve of
1641421 the measure would have no fiscal effect on state or local governments this is because there would be no change to the manner in which marriages are currently recognized by the state
1641422 whats different from our usual sundays when we wear our floral dresses and heels why do regular circles within the church feel unsafe for so many or do they
1641423 in our day the english words thee thou thy and thine are suitable for the language of prayer not because of how they were used anciently but because they are currently obsolete in common english discourse being unused in everyday communications they are now available as a distinctive form of address in english appropriate to symbolize respect closeness and reverence for the one being addressed
1641424 we should also remember that our position on special prayer language in english is based on modern revelations and the teachings and examples of modern prophets it is not part of the teachings known and accepted by our brothers and sisters of other christian and jewish faiths when leaders or members of other churches or synagogues phrase their prayers in the familiar forms of you or your this does not signify a lack of reverence or respect in their belief and practice but only a preference for the more modern language significantly this modern language is frequently the language used in the scriptural translations with which they are most familiar
1641425 one student in the class raised his hand and asked the professor how augustine could have the audacity to be so disrespectful in his prayers and why couldnt he use
1641426 is taking the premise that josephs word alone is not enough to make the determination obviously if it were enough to make that determination then everyone would accept it as truth
1641427 there were many places i believed were just too hard to swallow as an actual translation with each and every word revealed directly from god
1641428 references within the bom indicate the american continent e g about the american revolution
1641429 my testimony of it was based on an answer to the prayer whether it was an ancient record
1641430 given jss claims as a translator it is an all or nothing proposition
1641431 what benefits do you feel there are to believing the book of mormon is historical does believing it is historical make much of a difference to the way you study or use the book of mormon
1641432 how does an inspired writing or parable inspirely you differently then an ancient historical record
1641433 i count myself one of the ones who does not quite get what the big deal about the book of mormon seems to be
1641434 behold sarai thy wife is a very fair woman to look upon therefore it shall come to pass when the egyptians shall see her they will say she is his wife and they will kill you but they will save her alive therefore see that ye do on this wise let her say unto the egyptians she is thy sister and thy soul shall live
1641435 although joseph repeatedly lied when he denied practicing polygamy his fraudulent practice was necessary to build up the kingdom
1641436 having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof
1641437 thats the problem with such conviction on tangible things historicity instead of faith in things god that cant be proved and in my humble opinion the path to the actual slippery slope
1641438 when science can prove beyond any shadow of doubt that there is no way
1641439 one grand mystery that i learned about in grade school was the mound builders
1641440 having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof
1641441 finally no serious scholar outside of mormonism anti mormonism has undertaken the kind of project that nibley and groups like fair farms have done
1641442 first if the god of miracles actually did deliberately hide the evidence from me obviously he doesnt want me to know i guess my actual point here is that i cant believe in the kind of god who would engage in that type of behavior
1641443 because you dont believe in fill in the blank youll never be accepted in heaven
1641444 it doesnt seem to be a very effective argument for an antichrist until you read on and discover that korihor always knew there was a god
1641445 some things i believe are always going to be matters of faith in mortality
1641446 for fujitsu siemens computers as a leading international it corporation and market leader in germany continuous innovation our business pulse we have integrated the latest intel processor technology into our products from the outset and present a collection of sophisticated business notebooks that meet all professional needs through being ultra mobile as well as a complete desktop substitute
1641447 any company that is following a specific mobility strategy and wants to create a comprehensive it architecture will find our new notebooks immediately appealing
1641448 for the second half of the year we expect sales in the third quarter to be more than the second quarter results but only moderately as both motorola and lg issued warnings for a sequential drop in sales as well as an economic environment that remains challenging
1641449 all the hopes for mobile phone manufacturers for the overall year end growth results rest on the final quarter of the year when most new products will be introduced to the market and the normal seasonality will help boost sales
1641450 we know that it is by grace that we are saved after all we can do
1641451 it is by grace that we are saved after all we can do
1641452 confessing his name in the pre mortal life and being saved by his grace
1641453 rather than seeing the grace of god as a freeing enabling gift that already has been given they often internalize it as a reward dangling enticingly in front of them ready to be withdrawn if they screw up too badly and fail to repent immediately
1641454 as often as my people repent will i forgive them their trespasses against me
1641455 as oft as they repented and sought forgiveness with real intent they were forgiven
1641456 it means doing all that youre capable of as an imperfect being
1641457 actually i was at byu when that occurred and did find pace and his groupies to be preaching their own gospel so to speak in any case there was a cult personality surrounding pace so i actually welcome pace getting shut down at the time and felt it was long overdue
1641458 being like him means we possess his divine attributes such as charity do we develop charity by our own power or is it a gift from god
1641459 with hope and perfect love which endureth forever when all the saints shall dwell with god
1641460 all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
1641461 every principle and ordinance of the gospel of jesus christ is significant and important but there is none more essential to the salvation of the human family than the divine and eternally operative principle of repentance
1641462 for salvation cometh to none except it be through repentance and faith on the lord jesus christ
1641463 by grace that we are saved after all we can do
1641464 we have no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually
1641465 the savior cannot come and change our hearts uninvited we are the ones who decide whether or not we will let the spirit come into our lives to change us

1641467 i speak on behalf of the obama campaign with this next comment
1641468 that so and so said such and such about you know who
1641469 bob whats your stance on bushs decision to go into iraq do you think it was a mistake now that we know there were no wmds
1641470 well dana as i was telling my sons the other day we should all join hands and sing kumbyar and promote world peace while i explain my totally unrelated plan to cut taxes and lose weight
1641471 bob whats your stance on bushs decision to go into iraq do you think it was a mistake now that we know there were no wmds
1641472 what you think its fair to ask me a politically difficult question like that and expose my personal biases but you dont have to what possible answer could i give to that question that wouldnt make me look bad to needed electorate
1641473 well okay i admit i was against the war from the beginning
1641474 well at the time you thought there were wmds were you still against it
1641475 well yeah i think it wasnt worth the human cost of life even if there was a threat of wmd terrorism in our future
1641476 you mean to tell me dana and remember youre on national tv that you would have prefered to have not gone to war even if there had been wmds owned by a dictator that intended to use them if possible
1641477 well dana i respect your opinion i can definitely see where you are coming from and i wish i had thought more like you back then but honestly i was concerned at the time with wmd and lets remember this was just after 911 so the nation just wasnt ready to admit that it was better to do nothing and risk wmd terrorism in our future
1641478 the 30 percent of administrators who don t consider browser control to be important might want to revisit this issue employees installing their own browsers and associated tools like itunes and bittorrent are probably not thinking about security but about personal preferences while administrators are forced to deal with the associated security and productivity issues setting down a policy that controls which web browser and version type employees can use administrators are simplifying the job of keeping the web secure particularly important in light of the increased malware activity on the web
1641479 as hackers increasingly turn to compromising legitimate websites by inserting malicious code that redirects browsers to sites hosting malware a well managed web browser where vulnerabilities are patched and options are appropriately set help to preserve the integrity of corporate networks
1641480 please bless the refreshments that they may nourish and strengthen our bodies
1641481 parents should teach their children to thank god for their food and ask him to bless it before they eat each person including young children should be given a turn to ask god to bless the food
1641482 and ye shall serve the lord your god and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and i will take sickness away from the midst of thee exodus 23 25
1641483 then he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude luke 9 16
1641484 i have come to drop the customary blessing on the food since i dont know what it does and i cant find any evidence that it does anything or is commanded or even recommended by god
1641485 before i gave up blessing the food i started getting rid of the strengthen and nourish thing
1641486 what about opening our mouths if we accidentally take a bite first so that the blessing can get down there
1641487 may you pray over your books as you would bless food for thought
1641488 ye must not perform any thing unto the lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the father in the name of christ that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul 2 nephi 32 9
1641489 to consecrate or sanctify by a religious rite make or pronounce holy
1641490 bless the food that it will not harm our bodies
1641491 help those who dont like church that they wont have such a tough time next week
1641492 enjoy the food but please be quick about it cause im hungry
1641493 why just bless the hands what about the rest of the person who prepared it
1641494 bless the food that it will nourish and strengthen our bodies
1641495 do all you can to support the proposed constitutional amendment by donating of your means and time to assure that marriage in california is legally defined as being between a man and a woman
1641496 local church leaders will provide information about how you may become involved
1641497 but several months ago not long before he died i had the occasion of having the rev
1641498 bring it on i work for a tv station and part of my compensation is a small percentage of revenue generated by advertising lets hope both sides spend thousands of dollars on this
1641499 and if so does the u s supreme court have the authority to overturn it at some point
1641500 oh i guess thats not a violation of the law of chastity now so welcome back my bad
1641501 i wont let you change the term used for what you do to make it appear to not be sin
1641502 err because they are a talking about the state of californias constitution here not the united states constitution
1641503 the lds church does not however have any authority whatsoever to establish the definition of
1641504 i just dont know how the church can say the constitution is inspired and then go ballistic when the provision for extending the rights to the pursuit of happiness and equal protection to everyone comes up
1641505 the analysis i read of the amendment a few months ago in our local paper said that it would be just as subject to overturn by the california supreme court as the law established by prop 22 but im not a legal expert and wasnt preparing for a quiz so cant sum up the reasons for it
1641506 its not just the issue of an inspired constitution its also the very basic mormon teaching of a council in heaven wherein the bad guy came up with a plan to enforce commandments upon all of humanity in order to bring them all back to the presence of deity it never ceases to amaze me that leaders of a faith which holds this teaching insist upon engaging in the same tactic by attempting to legislatively enforce the tenets of their faith on a diverse citizenry
1641507 the government did not create marriage god did so i think it highly arrogant for government to claim it can decide what marriage is
1641508 you gays can go do what you want but please stop demanding that we redefine and rewrite the laws concerning marriage to include you
1641509 conservative member you are sick sick sick i find it impressive that you are twisted enough to decry buttsex but actively support genocide kudos to you pervert
1641510 genocide well just get rid of homosexual activities and we will all be better off if it takes a final solution well we will have to all sacrifice and bare it
1641511 my own impression is that theyve simply chosen an issue where they believe they can make themselves more acceptable to evangelical christians thus possibly enhancing missionary efforts
1641512 and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude
1641513 if this really is history repeating itself i e blacks amp the priesthood seems to me that there may be a moral obligation to speak up in opposition to the churchs opposition especially since this is both a political and moral issue but how to go about that and what is appropriate is tricky
1641514 it doesnt make a particle of difference what anybody ever said about the negro matter before the first day of june 1978
1641515 as to any slivers of light or any particles of darkness of the past we forget about them
1641516 conservative member perhaps you would kindly cast the first stone
1641517 actually 48 latter day guy brought up genocide my comment of 32 wasnt along those lines rant about being ok with killing people deleted
1641518 oh ok guess were done here back to your lives citizens
1641519 oh ok guess were done here back to your lives citizens
1641520 refer to sexual behaviour of a man or woman who either casually or regularly copulates with several partners
1641521 i think our society is approaching the point where gay people especially those who marry will not only be fully accepted but actually held up as heroes wonderful models of being true to yourself brave enough to stand up for your ideas etc of course its all a big deception by satan that will help bring down our civilization
1641522 i saw this happen as a teen back in the early eighties when i was a denizen in salt lake citys underground punk new wave scene being gay was very much a trend among certain factions of this group and many people experimented with it
1641523 we dont make heroes of our alcoholics or porn addicts
1641524 the bad guy came up with a plan to enforce commandments
1641525 you mention gays being held up as heroes just for conversations sake why do you suppose they might be held in such a regard if theirs can be passed of as an addiction like heroin alcohol porn etc i dont think you can we dont make heroes of our alcoholics or porn addicts
1641526 theyre anti gay bigots which obviously proves that their whole outlook is wrong but im a kind progressive person who can accept and love people who are different gays cant help it but religious people can so lets hate the religious people not the gays
1641527 it is ok to love the negroe but marriage between races is wrong
1641528 some reject the infusion of religious based values in public policy by urging that much of the violence and social divisiveness of the modern world is attributable to religious controversies
1641529 the chastity law is unconstitutional because it violates the requirement for separation of church and state
1641530 are going to religious institutions which use the funds to teach religious doctrines opposing teen age sex and abortion
1641531 inject ing religion into politics more wantonly than at any time since the know nothing crusade of the 1850s
1641532 what the framers of the u s constitution had in mind was more than separating church and state it was separating religion from politics
1641533 when they connect morality with a particular brand of religious faith and this in turn with political policies
1641534 secularism has not solved the problem posed by religion in public life so much as it has buried it by placing religion on the far side of the boundary marking the limit of the real world secularism prevents public life from taking religion seriously secularism does not teach us to live with those who are religious rather it demands that we ignore them and their views such a solution can remain stable only so long as those who are ignored acquiesce in their social situation
1641535 in a democracy that is free and robust an opinion is no more disqualified for being religious than for being atheistic or psychoanalytic or marxist or just plain dumb
1641536 as with individual citizens so also with the associations that citizens form to advance their opinions religious institutions may understand themselves to be brought into being by god but for the purposes of this democratic polity they are free associations of citizens as such they are guaranteed the same access to the public square as are the citizens who comprise them
1641537 no men including gay men where ever stopped from marrying any women or vice versa everybody has had an equal right to that choice regardless of sexual orientation
1641538 but my position is that the prohibition effects everybody equally regardless of race or sex
1641539 with all due respect to the participants this thread reflects exactly why i dread having this ssm fight all over again god help us all
1641540 ah these are the people who by and large get it about homosexuality being a sin and the need to resist the gay movement
1641541 at one point the church talked about negroes making the wrong choice in the pre existence and being inferior as did much of the world i can provide quotes if you really needme to
1641542 it is ok to love the negroe but marriage between races is wrong
1641543 also if you recall the church said oral sex was wrong at one time in fact it was a temple reccomend interview question and then they realized they were wrong it was not appropriate to ask that question so yeah i think they will accept anal sex as acceptable and i notice you dont mention sex between women so is that ok
1641544 the church is slowly but surely softening its stance on homosexuality it used to be that having the thoughts was caused by selfishness and if you just marry a member of the opposite sex it will go away now they dont say that in fact the official stance is dont get married
1641545 part of loving someone is wanting them to be happy and not demanding that they satisfy you gay marriage does not hurt anyone even if you think they are going to burn in hell for it it doesnt hurt anyone else accept them
1641546 oh and chris you need to repent of judging others unless you are a bishop judge in israel and they are in your flock you dont get to have an opinion on whether ot not they need to repent in fact you have no way of knowing what their leaders thinks of their particular circumstance
1641547 ok im going to ahead and live the gay sexual lifestyle
1641548 i am not at all clear on the same sex marriage destruction of civilization as we know it equation that is something i dont get at all
1641549 i am not clear that this is such a complicated issue the text of the statement seems to appeal to the will of the people but ignores the danger of mob rule mob rule was the driving force that disenfranchised the church in the last half of the 19th century recognizing the rights of others to contract seems pretty straightforward
1641550 even if there is some causation equation between ssm and the destruction of civilization i have a very hard time imagining the threat being greater than spousal child abuse exploitation of immigrant workers exploitation of the environment systemic infidelity by spouses and partners or if the voice of the people is that important working to promote the voice and power of the poor and disenfranchised
1641551 i am very disappointed with what the church is doing here because it does nothing to improve anybodies life as far as i can see
1641552 brain study shows differences between gays straights if this were the cause of the destruction of our civilization then blame god he designed the human brain
1641553 it is so good to see you writing pieces for the sugar beet again these parodies you have written here have me slapping my knee and roflmao keep up the good work
1641554 i think it is important to note that the first presidency letter is not anti gay it is pro family
1641555 there is a long standing tradition prohibiting same sex marriage
1641556 but in reality the issue with the danzigs is that you dont pick public fights with the church and stay in the church
1641557 i think its unfair to characterize this as a violation of the law of chastity when there is no possible outlet for a primal human need within a chaste state that is the very possibility they are fighting
1641558 the question at hand is what are reasonable restrictions in organizing societies norms
1641559 a lifestyle generally perceived to be outside the cultural norm
1641560 the church will only welcome celibate homosexuals regardless of marital status under ca law
1641561 to those that voted for the era or who worked for civil rights etc do you notice changed attitudes in the church
1641562 i might also point out that most of those who are critical of the church for supporting the california constitutional amendment are either outside of the church former members and never members or those who fancy themselves on their way out
1641563 i wish more active members in the bloggernacle showed evidence that they were giving the brethren the benefit of the doubt on this issue or at least considering why they might be right rather than formulating arguments as to why they might be wrong
1641564 i am more afraid that this people have so much confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of god whether they are led by him i am fearful they settle down in a state of blind self security trusting their eternal destiny in the hands of their leaders with a reckless confidence that in itself would thwart the purposes of god in their salvation and weaken that influence they could give to their leaders did they know for themselves by the revelations of jesus that they are led in the right way let every man and woman know by the whispering of the spirit of god to themselves whether their leaders are walking in the path the lord dictates or not
1641565 the problem is that i dont think the first presidency or the prophet have succeeded in showing exactly how traditional marriage would be harmed or even defeated by allowing gays to marry
1641566 what an unbelievably irresponsible immoral and un christ like directive
1641567 neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more
1641568 pof is clear in stating that the ideal is for children to have both a father and a mother is being raised by gay parents preferable to no adoption at all perhaps
1641569 i welcome the opportunity for you to show with the passage of time that this inclination really is a thing of the past
1641570 deleted for obvious reasons to anyone who read it before it was deleted
1641571 i dont want to think that the first presidency is completely wrong on this im trying to find a way to resolve the dissonance but for me in order to do that i have to accept that they just completely blew this one and are leading people astray with false traditions of their fathers and thats hard for me
1641572 also if you recall the church said oral sex was wrong at one time in fact it was a temple reccomend interview question and then they realized they were wrong it was not appropriate to ask that question so yeah i think they will accept anal sex as acceptable
1641573 question 1 if youre sick of it why did you bother to scroll down 170 comments
1641574 question 2 do you really think we wont be debating ssm until the second coming
1641575 i actually looked around the room in sunday school yesterday and thought
1641576 you mean sort of like how in reality its quite rare that heterosexual marriages last
1641577 a civil union so horrifying isnt at all horrifying you seem to have read into things a bit much
1641578 but they were born as chickens they cant control it its just part of who they are
1641579 churches have gotten involved in politico moral issues since time immemorial why should the mormon church be an exception
1641580 are you really going to let someone you love take the risk of dying of cancer because uh your uninformed belief that its deserved because the woman was a sinner
1641581 i think back to the days i was single and lonely it sucked i mean really sucked and yet i still had the hope for marriage or at the very least a companion to do all the things i mentioned above minus the masturbation i would encourage all of you particularly chris to really think back to those times in your life when you were looking for love and companionship and what it would have been like to be told that you were going to be celibate completely 100 celibate for the rest of your life maybe only then can you have a glimpse just a glimpse at what it must be like
1641582 even with such a terrible emotional burden to carry that still doesnt mean that entering into a gay sexual relationship is going to assuage the pain it may temporarily but in the end it will make things worse
1641583 well ray thats what tends to happen the last time a post went over 250 comments we had started with the church and ended up talking about mayonnaise arguably a deterioration
1641584 ok we are now going to elevate the status of alcoholic beverages formerly considered a vice to that of wholesome fruits and vegetables and make alcohol a valid food group in the accepted fda chart for good nutrition
1641585 even with such a terrible emotional burden to carry that still doesnt mean that entering into a gay sexual relationship is going to assuage the pain it may temporarily but in the end it will make things worse
1641586 i thought we settled it that the spaniards invented mayonnaise
1641587 but really everything they taught in the past about blacks still stands
1641588 there are statements in our literature by the early brethren which we have interpreted to mean that the negroes would not receive the priesthood in mortality
1641589 i have also heard that some members are planning to wear rainbow ribbons to church i wrote a letter to the editor of the tribune which is at
1641590 this commandment i give unto you that you love one another as i have loved you
1641591 forget everything that i have said days past that is contrary to the present revelation
1641592 i also wouldnt give sinners all the benefits that non sinners have
1641593 first there was nothing whatsoever to indicate that the letter was
1641594 the lds public relations department only commented after the letter came to the attention of a reporter
1641595 to be read in sacrament meeting on june 29 2008
1641596 you see real mormons know what its like to have others engage in political persecution against them based on religious differences real mormons know theres nothing godly about such behavior no matter how much the actors shout about deity as such real mormons have immense respect for the rights of their fellow beings real mormons would never attempt to restrict the legal rights of others simply because those others do not obey lds doctrine real mormons have the integrity and common sense to understand that the moment they step forward to limit the rights of others they endanger their own rights
1641597 the church did change their mind on oral sex solely because of the outrage of the members
1641598 but the church didnt change its view on oral sex it still teaches that sex should be natural and safe so oral anal
1641599 at the end of the day mormonism must equal unconditional love for our fellow men period
1641600 if you clean up your room we can go get ice cream tonight
1641601 i know this is a delicate and sensitive thing of which i am speaking there are hardened criminals who may have to be locked up there are unspeakable crimes such as deliberate murder and rape that justify harsh penalties but there are some who could be saved from long stultifying years in prison because of an unthoughtful foolish act somehow forgiveness with love and tolerance accomplishes miracles that can happen in no other way
1641602 if the church doesnt use government funds it can set whatever policy it wants and the government cannot do a thing about it
1641603 in fact i believe this letter is an effort to clean the church of those who would think for themselves
1641604 we should never allow our constitutions whether state or federal to become weapons in a crusade to impose a particular religious value system upon a pluralistic democracy
1641605 nein du kannst nicht mitkommen weil du nicht krit immun bist
1641606 e ven though i know rick grunders comment 2 is a satirical slam
1641607 well polygamy is not a threat to marriage since it still involves a man and a woman marriage is between people of the opposite sex i find same sex marriages far more objectionable than polygamy
1641608 ask anyone who has been married to and truly loved more than one spouse with their whole heart and soul
1641609 i find same sex marriages far more objectionable than polygamy
1641610 if someone can envision homosexual sealings why is it hard for that person to envision polygamous sealings that i simply dont get
1641611 since i have no idea whatsoever what that will look like in the hereafter we have been given next to nothing about it literally next to nothing
1641612 that they may bear the souls of men for herein is the work of my father glorified
1641613 marriage in heaven as one man married to one woman
1641614 i love you little girl come to see me today
1641615 we should gather all the good and true principles in the world and treasure them up or we shall not come out as true mormons
1641616 one of the grand fundamental principles of mormonism is to receive truth let it come from whence it may
1641617 we should gather all the good and true principles in the world and treasure them up or we shall not come out as true mormons
1641618 personally i suspect that buddhist philosophy and thought was originally inspired by god using the generic term here as were most of the great religions id be flatly unsurprised to hear that a signed statement to that effect had been issued by the first presidency amp quorum of the twelve at some point in the future
1641619 i dont know many members of the church who think otherwise and im pretty certain that the idea is almost canonical within the church
1641620 always been of the view that there are only two churches our church and the church of the devil
1641621 ultimately i cannot agree with a main buddhist ideal that the ultimate goal of oneself is the absence of a goal or nothing to become nothing
1641622 everything else is a mutation of our perfect understanding of the original
1641623 living separately and spending eternity telling god how great he is
1641624 all religions having truth and a level of salvation available to all vs god accepting whatever form of worship someone wants to give to him
1641625 accept exactly what we believe with special qualifications if we dont like you or burn in never ending anguish forever
1641626 you mormons dont understand how strong of a position you have by stating you have authority youre foolish because you dont talk about it more
1641627 many other things did he say unto me which i cannot write at this time
1641628 but our system unlike these earlier religious systems is not corrupt
1641629 all humans sin including prophets as witnessed by josephs experience
1641630 which of all the monotheistic or abrahamic religions is right
1641631 so i sort of think joseph may have been praying for forgiveness felt that he received forgiveness and later embellished the story
1641632 god is merciful and has fogiven my sins and i rjoice that he sendeth forth the comferter unto as many as believe and humbleeth themselves before him
1641633 smith judiciously wrote his book in an idiom that constantly invoked the holy cadences of the king james bible while alexander campbell was taking the eth endings off words smith was putting them on
1641634 the line of priesthood authority was broken but mankind was not left in total darkness or completely without revelation or inspiration the idea that with the crucifixion of christ the heavens were closed and that they opened in the first vision is not true the light of christ would be everywhere present to attend the children of god the holy ghost would visit seeking souls the prayers of the righteous would not go unanswered
1641635 if i want to use a mocking framework for this i have two options that i can think of right now i either make the abstract method public so the above code would compile or i can make it protected internal and then allow my internal members to be visible to my test project i dislike both approaches
1641636 what are you doing do you still wanna hang out
1641637 sure if ur not to tired but you really dont have to
1641638 out of the hospital feeling great and about to resume normal activities at home
1641639 we are pleased this event will help raise much needed funds to support the servicemen of our country through the princes chosen charities
1641640 somewhere between one flew over the cuckoos nest and the goon show
1641641 adept at most aspects of the role but he excels when the prince becomes a prankish provocateur
1641642 i rate tennant very highly but i wouldnt put him in the absolute front rank of contemporary hamlets
1641643 he is a fine hamlet whose virtues and occasional vices are inseparable from the production itself
1641644 a hamlet of quicksilver intelligence mimetic vigour and wild humour
1641645 ive seen bolder hamlets and more moving hamlets but few who kept me so riveted throughout
1641646 tennant is restless curt and mocking when he needs to be affectionate when he can be and apart from an occasional tendency to gabble pretty impressive
1641647 hamlet is often regarded as the acme of acting to test yourself against which isnt a particularly helpful thought to be honest
1641648 of course it is very flattering to be asked to do that role because of everything that is attached to it
1641649 but once you get into rehearsal you have to relinquish thoughts like that and just try and tell the story
1641650 d video and choose from one of download the usual ring tones
1641651 if you had millions if you were rich what would be the first piece of technology or gadget you would buy and why
1641652 you thought i was gona do house but i hit with a double story this is trouble homie i hope that you wont fumble on me
1641653 he who bore the atoning yoke has asked us to
1641654 the more we become like jesus the more we come to know him
1641655 inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me
1641656 one mistake we can make during this mortal experience is to value knowledge apart from the other qualities to be developed in submissive discipleship knowledge discovery its preservation its perpetuation is very important yet being knowledgeable while leaving undeveloped the virtues of love mercy meekness and patience is not enough for full discipleship mere intellectual assent to a truth deprives us of the relevant personal experiences that come from applying what we profess to believe there were probably orientation briefings in the premortal world about how this mortal life would unfold for us but the real experience is another thing
1641657 thus while knowledge is clearly very important standing alone it cannot save us
1641658 now if you believe all these things see that ye do them
1641659 so it is that discipleship requires all of us to translate doctrines covenants ordinances and teachings into improved personal behavior otherwise we may be doctrinally rich but end up developmentally poor
1641660 the gospels rich and true doctrines combine to constitute a call to a new and more abundant life but this is a lengthy process
1641661 put off the natural man and become a new creature
1641662 sometimes as we commence taking up the cross we ignore or neglect the first part of jesus instruction
1641663 deny yourselves and take up your cross daily and follow me
1641664 denying oneself has never been popular as a lifestyle and it is clearly not today self denial is portrayed by many as too puritanical and too ascetic scoffers have acquired powerful pulpits from which they bray their message which constantly puts down discipleship and encourages the natural man to think highly of himself and to please himself
1641665 the fundamental fact is that if we do not deny ourselves we are diverted even if not wholly consumed with the things of the world we are still diverted sufficiently to make serious discipleship impossible as a consequence all the gifts and talents god has given us are not put meekly on the altar to serve others and to please god instead we withhold to please ourselves diversion therefore is not necessarily gross transgression but it is a genuine deprivation especially if we consider what we might have become and what more we might have done to bless and to help others
1641666 one day if we remain faithful we will as the man or the woman of christ know that we too please god
1641667 o jerusalem jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not
1641668 have ye received his image in your countenances have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts
1641669 behold i say unto you they are made known unto me by the holy spirit of god behold i have fasted and prayed many days that i might know these things of myself and now i do know of myself that they are true for the lord god hath made them manifest unto me by his holy spirit and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me
1641670 a cucumber does not become a pickle all at once
1641671 because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of christ his sons and his daughters for behold this day he hath spiritually begotten you for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name therefore ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters
1641672 and they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state even less than the dust of the earth and they all cried aloud with one voice saying o have mercy and apply the atoning blood of christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins and our hearts may be purified for we believe in jesus christ the son of god who created heaven and earth and all things who shall come down among the children of men and it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the spirit of the lord came upon them and they were filled with joy having received a remission of their sins and having peace of conscience because of the exceeding faith which they had in jesus christ who should come according to the words which king benjamin had spoken unto them
1641673 i will tell you of the wrestle which i had before god before i received a remission of my sins
1641674 then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life
1641675 20 now this is the commandment repent all ye ends of the earth and come unto me and be baptized in my name that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the holy ghost that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day
1641676 and after they had been received unto baptism and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the holy ghost they were numbered among the people of the church of christ and their names were taken that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of god to keep them in the right way to keep them continually watchful unto prayer relying alone upon the merits of christ who was the author and the finisher of their faith
1641677 44 and nephi and lehi were in the midst of them yea they were encircled about yea they were as if in the midst of a flaming fire yet it did harm them not neither did it take hold upon the walls of the prison and they were filled with that joy which is unspeakable and full of glory 45 and behold the holy spirit of god did come down from heaven and did enter into their hearts and they were filled as if with fire and they could speak forth marvelous words
1641678 for the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the holy ghost
1641679 and it came to pass that when jesus had spoken these words unto nephi and to those who had been called now the number of them who had been called and received power and authority to baptize was twelve and behold he stretched forth his hand unto the multitude and cried unto them saying blessed are ye if ye shall give heed unto the words of these twelve whom i have chosen from among you to minister unto you and to be your servants and unto them i have given power that they may baptize you with water and after that ye are baptized with water behold i will baptize you with fire and with the holy ghost therefore blessed are ye if ye shall believe in me and be baptized after that ye have seen me and know that i am 2 and again more blessed are they who shall believe in your words because that ye shall testify that ye have seen me and that ye know that i am yea blessed are they who shall believe in your words and come down into the depths of humility and be baptized for they shall be visited with fire and with the holy ghost and shall receive a remission of their sins
1641680 and of tenets thou shalt not talk but thou shalt declare repentance and faith on the savior and remission of sins by baptism and by fire yea even the holy ghost
1641681 after it was truly manifested unto this first elder that he had received a remission of his sins he was entangled again in the vanities of the world
1641682 i think its a wonderful thing it proves that our constitution is still working
1641683 i see many people who are way too quick to put way too much stock in human historical and scientific understanding while my mindset is to wait and see what the real picture turns out to be in both historical and scientific areas im sure there are gigantic pieces of the puzzle that were missing yet some people are so quick to jump to conclusions based on very limited human understanding too much faith in humans not enough in god
1641684 for a faithful doubter to understand my views is to understand that the root of my logic will always be self skepticism
1641685 how would you characterize a non skeptical believer in positive terms
1641686 our bishop told my youngest son he could not serve a mission unless he could say with absolute certainty that he knew the gospel and church were true
1641687 no man hath seen god at any time except them who believe if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us
1641688 i will make all my goodness pass before you and i will proclaim before you the name lord and i will grant the grace that i will grant and show the compassion that i will show 20 but
1641689 you cannot see my face for man may not see me and live
1641690 the government is larger now and it acts as an anchor
1641691 during the great depression the government had neither the means nor the capability to serve as a backstop
1641692 i think well see a miserable job market and consequently an eroded standard of living for the vast majority of americans for several years
1641693 this is indistinguishable from a recession for a working family
1641694 theyre losing jobs and theyre getting a double bite as wage growth slows down and inflation kicks up people are losing out on both ends
1641695 you read the headlines and you look around and you think the world is coming to an end
1641696 but i dont think so if youre going to tell a worst case scenario story at this point its only going to be because the fed loses control
1641697 the fed isnt the whole story but its a big part of it
1641698 it allowed these absolutely insane bubbles to happen the lesson is you cant let these bubbles continue unabated with no policy making
1641699 they thought it was just a great thing that the stock market kept going higher and higher
1641700 then of course wall street just ran wild it was some mix of irresponsibility and downright greed theyre all sort of on the hook but greenspan sits front and center
1641701 if its 2005 you cant look at a 40 year run of data and say it must be a law of nature that housing prices never fall
1641702 so to think that theyre going to pay more for the same is not going to happen the consumer is not willing and candidly today not able to spend more on discretionary items
1641703 unprecedented conditions in the housing market are reflected in the second quarter results of our real estate wood products and timberlands businesses in addition high oil and energy prices have adversely affected all of our businesses
1641704 we may never know the full story since the bishop does not wish to comment and the school is citing privacy to keep things quiet
1641705 brigham young university baseball star kent walton who had been dismissed from school after his ecclesiastical endorsement was withdrawn by his bishop is enrolled at byu again and has returned to the cougars baseball team coach vance law told the deseret morning news thursday night
1641706 the original story made it sound like he had exhausted his appeals
1641707 ll nest mie jours saverouze au cors gent si mait amors ialowette nos mant
1641708 the father and the son appeared to the young farmboy
1641709 god the father and the son came down to joseph
1641710 he continued praying while the light appeared to be gradually descending towards him and as it drew nearer it increased in brightness and magnitude so that by the time that it reached the tops of the trees the whole wilderness for some distance around was illuminated in a most glorious and brilliant manner he expected to have seen the leaves and boughs of the trees consumed as soon as the light came in contact with them but perceiving that it did not produce that effect he was encouraged with the hope of being able to endure its presence it continued descending slowly until it rested upon the earth and he was enveloped in the midst of it
1641711 while fervently engaged in supplication my mind was taken away from the objects with which i was surrounded and i was enwrapped in a heavenly vision
1641712 when it first came upon him it produced a peculiar sensation throughout his whole system and immediately his mind was caught away from the natural objects with which he was surrounded and he was enwapped in a heavenly vision
1641713 when i came to myself again i found myself lying on my back looking up into heaven when the light had departed i had no strength but soon recovering in some degree i went home
1641714 mind was taken away from the objects with which he was surrounded i
1641715 if angels are traveling into our dimension physically from somewhere else they really are like hyper advanced space men picturing a visionary experience feels more spiritual to me
1641716 apparently he didnt bother to read the book of mormon or other lds literature that attributes the absence of miracles to apostasy
1641717 43 after this communication i saw the light in the room begin to gather immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me and it continued to do so until the room was again left dark except just around him when instantly i saw as it were a conduit open right up into heaven and he ascended till he entirely disappeared and the room was left as it had been before this heavenly light had made its appearance
1641718 and it came to pass as he prayed unto the lord there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him and he saw and heard much and because of the things which he saw and heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly
1641719 i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter
1641720 and being thus overcome with the spirit he was carried away in a vision even that he saw the heavens open and he thought he saw god sitting upon his throne surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising their god
1641721 that he remembered his vision differently at different times based on later spiritual experiences and theological reflection is very likely
1641722 vague comments claiming one has had experiences which are too sacred to talk about
1641723 do you believe that god the father the son and maybe even the holy ghost visited joseph smith in the spring of 1820
1641724 frankly the last paragraph of bills 18 is exactly what bothers me
1641725 unbiased observer s would conclude that todays lds church is apostate
1641726 after all claims of visions and miracles were quite common in early mormonism but fell off dramatically at least by the heber j grant administration
1641727 the old mormon experience of continual miracle claims has been largely replaced by vague comments claiming one has had experiences which are
1641728 the veil was taken from our minds and the eyes of our understanding were opened
1641729 we saw the lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit before us
1641730 his eyes were as a flame of fire the hair of his head was white like the pure snow his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters
1641731 after this vision closed the heavens were again opened unto us and moses appeared before us
1641732 after this vision had closed another great and glorious vision burst upon us for elijah the prophet who was taken to heaven without tasting death stood before us
1641733 i understand and agree with what you are saying to a degree but i just want to point out that
1641734 they possess the ability to influence the fortune of the living
1641735 are mormons more focused on ancestor worship than other christian faiths
1641736 yes and you missed japan i know bishops and others leaders who have ancestral shrines and i have no problem with that whatsoever
1641737 i believe it was the synod of hippo a d 393 that denied eucharist and baptism for the dead it was a practice of the galatian scythian gaelic keltic church to baptize their dead
1641738 im asleep now im sleeping ahhh feels so good to be falling asleep
1641739 thats why the church tells us to keep a gun with our food storage
1641740 i believe that principles of a christian religion would teach that we do not take the lives of others even to save our own
1641741 the lord will eventually cause the inspired teachings he has given to his children in various nations to be brought forth for the benefit of all people
1641742 be brought forth and gathered fortunately i just happen to have all the answers
1641743 much of the aprocrypha was true but it required the spirit of god to select the truth out of those writings
1641744 that god is not pleased with our neglect of the book of mormon
1641745 seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom
1641746 become acquainted with all good books and with languages tongues and people
1641747 the lord will eventually cause the inspired teachings he has given to his children in various nations to be brought forth for the benefit of all people
1641748 mormons are nice hardworking ethical people but their belief system is nothing more than a hodgepodge of 19th century fantasy mixed with some biblical overtones
1641749 in a radical departure from traditional belief wright says that christians are not ultimately destined for a spiritual place called heaven he says that at the end of time as we know it god will literally remake our physical bodies and return us to a newly restored planet
1641750 heaven is important but its not our final destination if you want to say that when someone dies they go to heaven fine but thats only a temporary holding pattern that is life after death and what im much more interested in or the new testament is much more interested in is what ive called life after life after death
1641751 ive often put it like this if somebody you know has been very ill you say poor old so and so hes just a shadow of his former self and the extraordinary truth in the new testament is that if you are in christ and dwell by the spirit you are just a shadow of your future self there is a real you to which the present you corresponds as a photocopy corresponds to the glorious original you know there is a real you which god is going to make and it will be more physical more real not less
1641752 during this hundred years of church history many other great truths not known before have been declared to the people and one of the greatest is that to hell there is an exit as well as an entrance hell is no place to which a vindictive judge sends prisoners to suffer and to be punished principally for his glory but it is a place prepared for the teaching the disciplining of those who failed to learn here upon the earth what they should have learned
1641753 does the fact that one of the worlds leading theologians is now teaching doctrine that could be found in lds sunday school add any external credibility to the mormon belief system
1641754 if i had read posts like this before i actually lost all faith i wonder if i would be where youre at now nevertheless i have no regrets for my decision and feel very at peace with where i am i also agree that john dehlins mormon stories are valuable and it was is a big part of why i continue to attend church with my family and avoid confrontation with the true believers around me
1641755 so when i start to doubt i do what i think clay is driving at pray
1641756 the paradox of repentance is that it is intended for a bad man but only good men can do it
1641757 if the prophet committed adultery would you leave the church
1641758 behold this is my doctrine whosoever repenteth and cometh unto me the same is my church whosoever declareth more or less than this the same is not of me but is against me therefore he is not of my church
1641759 i have come to the conclusion as andrew indicated that the corporate church is not the same as this spiritual church
1641760 immediately after christs death and resurrection there were at least three organized and separate churches
1641761 at a stake conference telecast in japan a ga even said that buddhism in japan had prepared japanese people for the gospel and compared it with the teachings of john the baptist maybe thats stretching it a bit maybe not but i believe that whatever is good and elevates people is part of the plan and is from god
1641762 teaching the first vision first really helped to set the stage for the rest of the discussion about god jesus and the gospel
1641763 oh yeah that kind of stuff happens all the time tanaka san had the same experience a few years ago
1641764 he will bearing false witness if he testifies to the truthfulness of the
1641765 whosoever repenteth and cometh unto me the same is my church
1641766 whosoever repenteth and cometh unto me the same is my church i like this definition the best
1641767 i believe that the church of jesus christ of latter day saints is led by a prophet of god and he is a fallible but divinely inspired spokesman for jesus christ on earth today
1641768 i believe that tcojcolds is led by jesus christ through modern living prophets and he has granted them priesthood authority
1641769 anyone who affirms any knowledge of anything joseph smith advanced as divine truth is bearing false witness because there is no way to know something to be true that is born out of falsehoods
1641770 a spiritual witness is an entirely subjective experience thus making it impossible imho to know if another is bearing false witness or not
1641771 no one can convince me by any logic or reason or science that god exists it is a subjective i e personal spiritual matter
1641772 god may be a poor planner if the lds church is the only true church on the earth and is to prepare the world for the second coming
1641773 why would god cause his spirit to be experienced differently
1641774 a spiritual witness is an entirely subjective experience thus making it impossible imho to know if another is bearing false witness or not
1641775 lastly i will share with you that i process possess a witness of the truthfulness of the restoration of the gospel through the prophet joseph smith of an order that allows me to say that i know it is true nothing doubting
1641776 just because joseph smith said he received these things from god doesnt mean he actually did we should not put our trust in the arm of flesh
1641777 it is their postbiblical creeds that are identified in joseph smiths first vision as an abomination but certainly not their individual members or their members biblical beliefs
1641778 individual orientation to the church of the lamb or to the great and abominable church is not by membership but by loyalty just as there latter day saints who belong to the great and abominable church because of their loyalty to satan and his life style so there are members of other churches who belong to the lamb because of their loyalty to him and his life style membership is based more on who has your heart than on who has your records
1641779 i have faith that joseph was a prophet so in that case we are not talking about an
1641780 spiritual experiences anchor us so that our foundation is built on rock instead of sand most church members who dwindle in unbelief do so because they lack spiritual experiences
1641781 maybe for you it comes a little at a time
1641782 are you sure you are worthy to receive an answer
1641783 aside from the various written accounts of the first vision all of which were written for different reasons different audiences at different times and many many years after the fact who can really say what factually happened
1641784 dear diary twelve years ago something extraordinary happened i forgot to mention
1641785 i see it as incomplete and possibly motivated by a desire to make it sound less controversial than it really was
1641786 had seen a vision you knew it and you knew that god knew it and you could not deny it neither dared you do it at least you knew that by so doing you would offend god and come under condemnation
1641787 wouldnt you know that god has your back when giving a full and accurate account of the actual events
1641788 meno men o to stay in a given place state relation or expectancy abide continue dwell endure be present remain stand tarry for thine own
1641789 if you continue in my word then you are truly disciples of mine 32 and you will know the truth and the truth will make you free
1641790 only atheism can stand on its merits because atheists dont have an official organization with which they affiliate
1641791 there isnt a church on the planet that doesnt have that issue
1641792 it sprinkles in junk like becoming a god of our own world
1641793 just because you are fond of an idea or you think a man made doctrine is inspiring doesnt make it reality sorry
1641794 i wish the first presidency and quorum of the twelve would come clean about the history of joseph smith and lds church origins
1641795 i for myself know as much as i personally am able to know that the church is true since i cant fathom any other way to explain my impressions and experiences
1641796 do you think the js papers are a positive step in this direction i do they said they want nothing left out
1641797 it might be helpful to post a new thread specifically about the concept of becoming like god as a biblical standard
1641798 far too often people get so caught up in the impossibility of perfection completion in the first two that they lose sight of the one that truly can animate and energize
1641799 see the history for what it is without the mental gymnastics to try and fit it to a particular paradigm
1641800 really i think the only disaffected people i truly understand are those who become agnostic or atheist there are just too many problems historically and otherwise with every religion that none could be held to this kind of scrutiny
1641801 a spiritual witness combined with a well studied out search for the truth
1641802 i believe we as mormons are looking through a glass darkly just like all the other religions
1641803 mormons are human too thus they are judgmental just like everyone else
1641804 spiritual witness combined with a well studied out search for the truth yields fairly reliable results
1641805 i dont believe god is near as interested in one religions dogma over another as he is in how we treat each other
1641806 i believe answers to prayers are indeed more important than self study though you have to have both
1641807 others arent being rational and they are just paying attention to spiritual witnesses
1641808 just for fun lets say js and his contemporaries made it all up or were deceived by demons posing as angels of light
1641809 btw the truly insidious thing is believing you can diminish the work of the savior and work your way back to god
1641810 we will have done a bunch of stuff for nothing
1641811 if you think you can please god with your sacrifices repentance and obedience god will damn you for denigrating his grace
1641812 22 and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his ccommandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight
1641813 heb 11 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him
1641814 now this is the commandment repent all ye ends of the earth and come unto me and be baptized in my name that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the holy ghost that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day
1641815 not to be found in the bible in its fullness
1641816 i dont think you should read in more than that
1641817 i think we show our love for god by our actions which should rightfully be a reflection of what is in our hearts
1641818 btw the truly insidious thing is believing you can diminish the work of the savior and work your way back to god
1641819 i wish you werent trying to be cute with the language and consider the argument
1641820 if you can divert a person from returning to god by even 1 then over the course of a lifetime you will miss the mark
1641821 did gabriel appear to mohamed or was he snacking on funky mushrooms
1641822 this is why i am concerned by emphasis on seemingly superficial things like no tats one pair of earrings skirts vs
1641823 see more of the big picture that is covered for others that they just dont see but still see that extra stuff darkly not understanding it fully
1641824 10 and i also thank my god yea my great god that he hath granted unto us that we might repent of these things and also that he hath forgiven us of those our many sins and murders which we have committed and taken away the guilt from our hearts through the merits of his son
1641825 11 and now behold my brethren since it has been all that we could do as we were the most lost of all mankind to repent of all our sins and the many murders which we have committed and to get god to take them away from our hearts for it was all we could do to repent sufficiently before god that he would take away our stain
1641826 where does my salvation lie other than love god love your fellow man repent of your sins receive jesus as your savior and redeemer and receive sanctification through personal righteousness
1641827 that we have to work our way back to heaven and then grace fills in the rest
1641828 all the religions of the day were an abomination in his sight
1641829 a lot of problems are made harder to overcome or deal with due to the shame involved and needing to appear perfect
1641830 of god not denying power to god but just denying the power of god i
1641831 what if the little girl said no im keeping my money
1641832 grace as a gift and you have to accept or reject it
1641833 most are also mindful of having to be follow the laws and ordances of the gosepl but in the proper context
1641834 is there a religion out there that that wouldnt have been a true statement about if so you should go join it oh and take me please
1641835 i had a testimony and then i decided im going to take a look at this without relying on spiritual experiences or the way that i see things when i trust the spirit
1641836 just to echo hawkgrrrl jsh 1 19 is probably the most frequently and badly misquoted and misinterpreted verse in all of our canon both by critics and members
1641837 both you and hawkgrrrl dont believe in the story of the first vision or youre deliberately twisting the message to win the argument i guess its par for the course and why i have problems with the church
1641838 god told joseph not to join any church because they were wrong and their creeds were abominable but he said nothing about the motivation of the believers and did not speak disparagingly of them as people
1641839 you and hawkgrrrl would have much more credibility if you would own your doctrines instead of this constant dodge to lawyer up what was said
1641840 but nothing seems important enough to abandon the idea of jesus christ as our savior and redeemer who atoned for our sins that we can live with him again everything else takes a back seat to that
1641841 doug i need to say one more thing and its going to be even harder to say in the way i want to convey it
1641842 the message of the restoration of the gospel of jesus christ
1641843 the restoration of the gospel of jesus christ through joseph smith
1641844 the book of mormon another testament of jesus christ oh look theres a picture of joseph and one of his scribes translating the plates no sheet between them no urim and thummim held in bows no breastplate and the plates are open in front of joseph and he appears to be reading the reformed egyptian as a man might read a printed book and the church owns the copyright for this image i wonder what russel m
1641845 this message of the restoration is either true or it is not
1641846 its difficult to have any kind of dialog with you adamf if you dont express the specific things you disagree with me about
1641847 do i need to pray to know that i exist
1641848 the new testament mentions a number of times that the just live by faith not by knowing
1641849 body of flesh and bones as ye see me have
1641850 q if the experience of the spirit gives us knowledge say that god is real then it follows that what i know is true knowledge entails justified true belief so how could i possibly be wrong about what i know to be true as you seem to suggest
1641851 our church is true join it if you want eternal salvation
1641852 ham on 175 i began to suspect somewhere around comment 19 but didnt want to say anything you know let some other people figure it out want to spoil it
1641853 i dont see it any more offensive than any other religions attempts to tell everybody else how wrong they are
1641854 they see two alternatives so if they call my creeds an abomination they have no alternative other than to assume that i will end up in hell as a result therefore they project that meaning on jsh 1 19 and read it as harshly as it would be within their theological perspective
1641855 i see it much like the beheading of laban why include that account those translation details and cause such heartburn among many when it would seem so much more convincing if that story those details were left unrecorded
1641856 yea and i also knew that he had sought to take away mine own life yea and he would not hearken unto the commandments of the lord and he also had taken away our property
1641857 behold the lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes it is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief
1641858 do you believe the point i was trying to make in post 119 about the first vision story being offensive to most non members
1641859 compared to what is said about us by our critics its downright gentle
1641860 interestingly dont we believe only mormons will actually end up in hell
1641861 im going to find critism of anything that doesnt look silly and support my preconceived notions
1641862 what ive abandoned is any faith in man i e joseph smith jr brigham young spencer w kimball gordon b hinckley thomas s monson if i cant trust these prophets seers and revelators to get their story straight and be consistent then i have to make sure my faith is anchored in jesus
1641863 im just saying i think we all get caught up in extreme admiration of men who attain a high rank in church as well as within our broader culture
1641864 loving ammon ryes question for someone to put in a future post btw
1641865 im just saying i think we all get caught up in extreme admiration of men who attain a high rank in church as well as within our broader culture
1641866 i personally feel like a fool when i have professed belief in an lds doctrine only to have it thrown out in the blink of an eye on television by gbh
1641867 d amp c 132 clearly states polygamy is necessary and required to obtain the highest degree of glory
1641868 obviously since only a small minority of members actually practiced it
1641869 revelation given through joseph smith the prophet at nauvoo illinois recorded july 12 1843 relating to the new and everlasting covenant including the eternity of the marriage covenant as also plurality of wives
1641870 and i now publicly declare that my advice to the latter day saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land
1641871 to invalidate an act measure etc by a later action or a higher authority
1641872 im still waiting for a direct quote from js where he says he saw god the father and jesus christ by mentioning them specifically by name
1641873 according to brigham young she will never get to the highest level of the celestial kingdom
1641874 i havent seen a thread go out to 300 comments in quite some time
1641875 is it human and imperfect to declare polygamy to be
1641876 jsh 1 17 is good enough since there is no other legitimate way to interpret it are you saying this was not the father and the son
1641877 i saw god the father and his son jesus christ and they both spoke to me in the way one man speaks to another
1641878 i suppose you have an even bigger issue with the fact that there is no specific revelation from the time of jesus that abolishes the practices of the law of moses
1641879 for my next post maybe ill do what is controversial in the church
1641880 this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
1641881 i am now wondering if youd allow the reverse in a private conversation
1641882 i have learned the following about mormon matters if it isnt mormon it doesnt matter
1641883 john resonates more with heterodox members since its a lot easier to interpret his writings however one wants to interpret them
1641884 but they are also reading about what is happening to the economy i dont think prices will fall but they might just level out for a while before rising again
1641885 i see 6000 acre as the benchmark for arable land generally
1641886 although good compact blocks will go for 7000 acre or more
1641887 that which we teach which is true and will not change
1641888 we cant have truths and doctrines be separate things or can we
1641889 he bore record that the revelations in the doctrine and covenants were true and that the lectures judicially were written and compiled and were profitable for doctrine
1641890 why be so certain that you comprehend the things of god when all things with you are so uncertain
1641891 that wasnt a doctrine i guess since it got changed
1641892 calling and election being made sure second comforter second anointing were just a few everything had some imaginary ordinance associated with it of course just to make the doctrine appear more important and his ideas more trustworthy
1641893 the preconceptions of the modern age led mormons as well as critics to see things in the book of mormon that are not there
1641894 the profound truths of the scriptures mixed with an infinite and changing body of traditions allowing us to envision such truths
1641895 4 contrary to anti mormon smears ive never actually found a definitive quote from 19th century mormons leaders confirming a belief in a sexual act between a sealed mary and god
1641896 the birth of the savior was as natural as are the births of our children it was the result of natural action he partook of flesh and blood was begotten of his father as we are of our fathers
1641897 the fleshly body of jesus required a mother as well as a father therefore the father and mother of jesus according to the flesh must have been associated together in the capacity of husband and wife hence the virgin mary must have been for the time being the lawful wife of god the father we use the term lawful wife because it would be blasphemous in the highest degree to say that he overshadowed her or begat the savior unlawfully inasmuch as god was the first husband to her it may be that he only gave her to be the wife of joseph while in the mortal state and that he intended after the resurrection to again take her as one of his own wives to raise up immortal spirits in eternity
1641898 they tell us the book of mormon states that jesus was begotten of the holy ghost i challenge that statement the book of mormon teaches no such thing neither does the bible christ was begotten of god he was not born without the aid of man and that man was god
1641899 he had the best of intentions and simply didnt understand the difference between his speculations and actual doctrine this is the very problem that creates creeds in the first place we mormons are not immune to the urge
1641900 i agree 100 that the problem lies in the unconventional way many lds use the term
1641901 when youre a scientologist and you drive by an accident you know you have to do something about it because you know youre the only one who can really help we are the way to happiness we can bring peace and unite cultures
1641902 i realized that as a holder of the melchizedek priesthood i was the only one who could have really helped that guy if there was an emergency
1641903 in november 2007 three talks involving the flying spaghetti monster are scheduled to be delivered at the american academy of religions annual meeting in san diego
1641904 the religious text of the pastafarian religion is called the loose canon
1641905 in december 2005 bobby henderson received a reported usd 80 000 advance to pen the gospel of the flying spaghetti monster
1641906 i think more lobbying is needed because this blog which is by far the best mormon oriented blog in the bloggernacle didnt make the cut for deseret news
1641907 mormon matters by far the best mormon oriented blog in the bloggernacle
1641908 for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again
1641909 now these are the words which jesus taught his disciples that they should say unto the people judge not unrighteously that ye be not judged but judge righteous judgment
1641910 there are two kinds of judging final judgments which we are forbidden to make and intermediate judgments which we are directed to make but upon righteous principles
1641911 judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment
1641912 who am i to judge another when i walk imperfectly
1641913 look bob smoking is bad for you and you know it stop now before you get addicted
1641914 as we mature and gain life experience most of us are increasingly hesitant to judge others
1641915 for many of the years in her life i judged her and i said change you can get over this i finally came to the realization that you have to love her for just what she is right now
1641916 she lived in a bubble most of her life in my opinion
1641917 and i feel thats probably where i should be too
1641918 so what may have been originally taken as license to adopt an
1641919 this is a mirror image of what happened last year
1641920 luckily we are in a better position this year because we have been effective in rolling out a vaccine
1641921 we cant believe it thats a tonne an acre more than i ever could have hoped
1641922 the rape has been pleasantly surprising it didnt look very good all year with pigeon and slug damage
1641923 jehovahs witnesses are the opposite they only count as members people who are currently involved in a rather high degree of church activity their denominations self reported number is therefore minimal and is less than the number of people who would self report as jw
1641924 yes indeed my friend here said that she is a jw but has not been baptised yet and neither has her brother even though they are devout she says it is because they are as yet unable to devote them fully to living the life of a jw she said it takes someone about 3 years to be a full jw
1641925 try to force the wards to go out and convert more members so they would have enough people to fill callings the local leadership was basically trying to create smaller wards so the members would feel pressure to up the numbers
1641926 this is what was announced over the pulpit when they made the change usually wards are split to make sure that everyone has a calling and they dont have to make them up to give everyone a job
1641927 given that the current system is no longer yielding real growth in the us should the lds church adopt the member missionary approach of the jws
1641928 smith influence on me because they accord with my own understandings regarding the negro
1641929 i cannot accept the idea of public accommodations taking from the whites their wishes to satisfy the negro
1641930 i agree the negro is entitled to considerations but not full social benefits how racists
1641931 certainy i am not for exploiting racial or religious prejudices
1641932 principle religious or otherwise cannot be abrogated for political expediency
1641933 this must be a tender point and one which should call forth the candid reflections of all men before they let loose upon the world a community of people who might peradventure overrun our country and violate the most sacred principles of human society chastity and virtue
1641934 nowadays if its not in the scriptures or a very fundamental mormon christian doctrine we are much more liberated to believe as we wish the church really has come a long way in this regard i feel
1641935 most importantly if the church can be so incredibly wrong about a social political doctrinal teaching as they were regarding blacks race segregation etc what modern church teachings are we perpetuating that we will look back in 50 years and also feel embarrassed by or are those days behind us
1641936 the position on homosexuals will be an embarrassment in 50 years this is almost exclusively a biological phenomena people are born with their orientation they dont choose it
1641937 could you as a heterosexual male mentally will it upon yourself to be physically emotionally chemically and romantically attracted to another male
1641938 unfortunately racism the abhorrent and morally destructive theory that claims superiority of one person over another by reason of race color ethnicity or cultural background remains one of the abiding sins of societies the world over the cause of much of the strife and conflict in the world racism is an offense against god and a tool in the devils hands in common with other christians members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints regret the actions and statements of individuals who have been insensitive to the pain suffered by the victims of racism and ask gods forgiveness for those guilty of this grievous sin the sin of racism will be eliminated only when every human being treats all others with the dignity and respect each deserves as a beloved child of our heavenly father how grateful i am that the church of jesus christ of latter day saints has from its beginnings stood strongly against racism in any of its malignant manifestations
1641939 not only was cain called upon to suffer but because of his wickedness he became the father of an inferior race
1641940 and if any man mingle his seed with the seed of cain the only way he could get rid of it or have salvation would be to come forward and have his head cut off and spill his blood upon the ground it would also take the life of his children
1641941 shall i tell you the law of god in regard to the african race if the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of cain the penalty under the law of god is death on the spot this will always be so
1641942 and after the flood we are told that the curse that had been pronounced upon cain was continued through hams wife as he had married a wife of that seed
1641943 how grateful i am that the church of jesus christ of latter day saints has from its beginnings stood strongly against racism in any of its malignant manifestations
1641944 shall i tell you the law of god in regard to the african race if the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of cain the penalty under the law of god is death on the spot this will always be so
1641945 advocating the murder of black people is not racist to you that is the worst kind of racism to use the weak excuse that we dont know the intent is ludicrous
1641946 the attitude of the church with reference to negroes remains as it has always stood it is not a matter of the declaration of a policy but of direct commandment from the lord on which is founded the doctrine of the church from the days of its organization to the effect that negroes may become members of the church but that they are not entitled to the priesthood at the present time
1641947 the big 5 early seminal works on mormonism the books that really kickstarted the so called
1641948 reads like a combination of a coffee shop intimate chat and a stimulating history lecture mrs shipps writes clearly and engagingly about the evolving process of the lds faith i was engrossed the whole way through
1641949 in 1939 the two novels that generated the most comment and largest sales in the united states were john steinbeck s the grapes of wrath and vardis fisher s children of god both were by writers from the west and both novels chronicled memorable treks across the american west
1641950 they need what we have but we do not need what they have but we do not think we are better than they only more blessed because we do have the truth we worship the jesus of the bible but not the jesus of orthodox or protestant christianity
1641951 it is they who are at war with us we are not at war with them
1641952 no were different no were just like you no were like you only not exactly
1641953 i think we spend more time categorizing ourselves and getting categorized by others than any faith
1641954 we do not want to be associated with the orthodox or protestant christians but we do want to maintain friendly relations with them they need what we have but we do not need what they have
1641955 at least its been broken down when its been raining
1641956 well probably be straight into the spring barley and wheat as soon as the weather dries up its turning all the time and is all still standing
1641957 heh sampo klo lo gak kluar dalam 3 itungan bakal gw obrak abrik ni kamar mandi
1641958 shouldnt we worship his god since he would be greater than him
1641959 say gods father wanted some children on this planet also and so did his brother and so on since they are all individuals could it be that they all want to be worshipped differently
1641960 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1641961 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1641962 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programmes that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1641963 in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1641964 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1641965 what is your answer to people including myself who believe that the votes you get will take away from the democratic party and ensure mccain wins
1641966 people who say that a vote for you is a vote for mccain
1641967 no because that question implies that somehow i am less equal in running for election than two crooked politicians in washington
1641968 gaben sich schon motocross legenden wie hans maisch sylvain geboers harry everts roger de coster greg albertyn und nicht zuletzt pit beirer die ehre
1641969 wir sind weiterhin der ansicht dass die atp dem hamburger turnier den masters status zu unrecht entzogen hat
1641970 das turnier am rothenbaum war immer eines der h chsten kategorie und der masters status ist uns zeitlich unbegrenzt zuerkannt worden solange wir die regularien der atp erf llen m sste dieser statuts jedes jahr erneuert werden
1641971 the father incomprehensible the son incomprehensible and the holy ghost incomprehensible
1641972 we shall be even gods if we shall deserve to be among those of whom he declared i have said ye are gods
1641973 to you it was shown that you might know that the lord himself is god there is none other besides him
1641974 the secret things belong to the lord our god but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law
1641975 great is the lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable
1641976 no one comprehends the things of god except the spirit of god
1641977 such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high i cannot attain it
1641978 thus says the lord let not the wise man boast in his wisdom let not the mighty man boast in his might let not the rich man boast in his riches but let him who boasts boast in this that he understands and knows me that i am the lord who practices steadfast love justice and righteousness in the earth
1641979 i think one of the keys to this is giving up on the idea of debating for the purpose of trying to win understanding each other is much more important especially on a site like this
1641980 if one believes in the trinity derives motivation from that doctrine to live his religion more fully and if i get the same from believing in a mormon concept of god as i do why does it matter that we do not agree
1641981 which is more important the personal characteristics of god or what god looks like the doctrine of the trinity goes far beyond what god looks like it defines his very nature and encompasses his personal characteristics even before i converted to catholicism as an adult i believed that god is triune because i could not reconcile the one god in the ot with the divinity of christ and the hs in the nt for me it makes sense
1641982 hear o israel the lord our god is one lord
1641983 which is more important the personal characteristics of god or gods metaphysical nature
1641984 if our brothers and sisters only understood that they are literally children of god i think their outlook on life would change dramatically
1641985 the trinity goes far beyond what god looks like it defines his very nature and encompasses his personal characteristics
1641986 so i am curious considering the fact that the lds church holds to the same claim of apostolic succession as catholics why does there appear to be a need legitimacy by the lds church to be loosely associated with traditional christianity which js claimed teaches doctrines that are abominations before god
1641987 why are lds concerned about being in agreement with c ps on the issue or any issue for that matter after all the concept of the trinity is a catholic dogma if lds members are going to embrace the apostasy i am not sure why this doctrine even appeals to you
1641988 how do you feel about the mormon belief about the trinity
1641989 what youre saying im not going to go to heaven unless im a mormon
1641990 does one of the many christian conceptualizations of god inspire more visits
1641991 however i believe the lds teaching regarding a oneness of will and purpose does not go far enough in explaining the nature of god
1641992 without the doctrine of the trinity to define the nature of god which includes the doctrine of the incarnation of christ we are left without a knowledge of the father the son and the hs therefore how can we know any of his characteristics
1641993 the only thing that i would add is that i think behavior can also lead to belief many ps tend to criticize cs for simply going through the motions at mass i would argue that participation in the mass can often lead a mindless c to a deep and personal faith in jesus christ over time
1641994 i think it is a bit unfair to call out c ps regarding substance theology sending you to hell ive never said that nor have i implied it
1641995 i believe the catholic protestant explanation is in contradiction and that this alone disqualifies it as a loving god would never require profession of belief in a bonafide contradiction to qualify for salvation
1641996 whoever wishes to be saved must above all keep the catholic faith
1641997 he therefore who wishes to be saved must believe thus about the trinity
1641998 christian in dictionary com and that under a dictionary definition mormons are christian this eliminates any chance for misrepresentation and thus i see it as tolerant
1641999 mormons are christian in that they believe jesus christ is the son of god the redeemer and that he is fully god mormons are not christian in that they do not accept the athanasius creed
1642000 mormons are not christians in the sense that they do not believe in the athanasius or other creeds however they do believe in jesus christ that jesus is the son of god that he is fully god and that he is the redeemer just as us christians believe
1642001 i do not make any judgments about the quality of faith or obedience or the eternal destination of those who reject the doctrine
1642002 how can members of the lds church claim non mormons are christian
1642003 so i am curious considering the fact that the lds church holds to the same claim of apostolic succession as catholics why does there appear to be a need legitimacy by the lds church to be loosely associated with traditional christianity which js claimed teaches doctrines that are abominations before god
1642004 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
1642005 for behold this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man
1642006 also if there be two spirits and one shall be more intelligent than the other yet these two spirits notwithstanding one is more intelligent than the other have no beginning they existed before they shall have no end they shall exist after for they are gnolaum or eternal
1642007 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect
1642008 and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together
1642009 imagine a protestant minister or catholic priest saying to his congregation
1642010 jws follow jesus christ the son of god and put faith in the ransom sacrifice he provided for the salvation of mankind
1642011 if ye believe this the bofm ye will believe that the bible
1642012 well not that i ever said mormons were non christian but rather that mormon doctrine and catholic doctrine on the trinity do not agree
1642013 expect them to have a good reason for why they believe before i educate them
1642014 on a different note i think many fundamentalist ps tend to attack what is
1642015 and behold he shall be born of mary at jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers she being a virgin a precious and chosen vessel who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the holy ghost and bring forth a son yea even the son of god
1642016 it is no wonder those outside our church think we teach that when some members cant stop saying it
1642017 he is the great lion who called us out of our own world
1642018 dont you know how can we describe it to her have you ever seen a cat
1642019 well a lion is a little bit only a little bit mind you like a huge cat with a mane at least its not like a horses mane you know its more like a judges wig and its yellow and terrifically strong
1642020 that we should do no better with your lion as you call it than we did with your sun you have seen lamps and so you imagined a bigger and better lamp and called it the sun youve seen cats and now you want a bigger and better cat and its to so called a lion well tis a pretty make believe though to say a truth it would suit you all better if you were younger and look how you can put nothing into your make believe without copying it from the real world this world of mine which is the only world but even you children are too old for such play as for you my prince that art a man full grown fie upon you are you not ashamed of such toys come all of you put away these childish tricks i have work for you all in the real world there is no narnia no overworld no sky no sun no aslan and now to bed all and let us begin a wiser life tomorrow but first to bed to sleep deep sleep soft pillows sleep without foolish dreams
1642021 people say we mormons are all going to hell and if thats where we all end up in the next life well kick the devil out and turn it into a paradise
1642022 and if we go to hell we will turn the devils out of doors and make a heaven of it where this people are there is good society
1642023 god withholding his light until the modern cultural church falls apart
1642024 the future will either be like the jetsons or like children of men
1642025 its really interesting to me as a liberal that there seems to be more suspicion among lds about liberals and democrats than there is about this sort of far right wing ideology
1642026 an an anarchosyndicalist i can relate to some things you have proposed but i would hardly adopt all that you have labeled a neofundamentalist mormon with as my
1642027 trainer defraigne wird vor allem seine einstellung zum spiel gefallen
1642028 was mir auff llt ist dass die schiedsrichter recht kleinlich pfeifen bei situationen die zwar hart aussehen wo aber nichts passiert pfeifen sie einfach ab
1642029 in england ist es so attraktiv f r die fans weil viel mehr in den strafr umen passiert die deutschen schiris sind da bervorsichtig wir spieler sind doch aber daf r da die leute zu unterhalten
1642030 solche vorw rfe kennen wir doch seit jahren und au erdem wie will jens lehmann das berhaupt beurteilen er war doch die letzten jahre gar nicht in deutschland
1642031 wenn sein schuss rein gegangen w re h tte das ergebnis anders aussehen k nnen
1642032 ivankovic der in der abgelaufenen spielzeit noch das trikot der hsg wetzlar trug
1642033 so der sportliche leiter der wetzlarer rainer dotzauer der hofft dass in diesem spiel avishay smoler
1642034 den h tten nicht viele gehalten david seaman jedenfalls nicht
1642035 wir wollen im mai einige titel haben eine saison ohne titel w re ein desaster
1642036 wir werden erst ende august oder anfang september unseren leistungsstand erreicht haben
1642037 wir haben noch nicht die voraussetzungen um inter unter druck zu setzen
1642038 ich glaube dass wir gut genug sind um die ersten h rden im pokal und in der liga zu schaffen
1642039 ich war nicht damit einverstanden dass der schiedsrichter gegen uns einen freisto gegeben hat da habe ich ihn einfach wichser genannt ich glaube das war ziemlich dumm
1642040 i have a concern with jehovahs witnesses saying that they believe jesus is divine
1642041 yeah but it says right here 5 for there is one person of the father another of the son and another of the holy ghost so you see jill this says that you actually do believe in three gods logically speaking because this contradicts the other statement
1642042 hey i talked to jill and she believes in only one god please stop lying about jill
1642043 hey jill believes a contradiction thus to me shes a polytheist besides to us muslims this is the same as polytheism since we believe in a single person in god the opposite of true is false thats why i say she denies the one true monotheistic god
1642044 i cant accept this trinitarian belief of yours personally for i see it as a contradiction
1642045 im not interested in understanding you i just want to prove you are wrong
1642046 if we want to be accepted by them as christian we need to show them that we have had a
1642047 the role of the leader is to define reality and give hope
1642048 biased editing of official materials to control information or public image
1642049 because once people feel lied to or betrayed its not likely that that trust will be recovered
1642050 it is the absolute right of the church to supervise the formation of public opinion
1642051 i think that perspective is just an attempt to give the church wiggle room
1642052 sounds like a bunch of people are on their high horse
1642053 it is natural for men to hate the weak and vulnerable
1642054 we all whitewash our lives for this reason we are careful to conceal all our weaknesses and project our strengths so that other people wont see our sin or weakness why because if people could see our sin and weakness they would hate us and seek our destruction it is natural for men to hate the weak and vulnerable
1642055 when i last applied for a job did i list all of the negative things about myself on my resume when i was in the job interview did i tell them all of the ways id fallen short in previous jobs did i volunteer every reason why they should not hire me
1642056 i am the only true way for your business to succeed
1642057 the other guys have some truth but i am all the truth youll ever need baby
1642058 please consider the possibility that you may have no idea what youre talking about
1642059 29 andrew i do not claim to need no whitewash i do not present my history as untainted the church does and has
1642060 when church leaders deliberately attempt to conceal distort or present information in a way that fundamentally alters the perception of the church from an accurate one to one that benefits the church at the expense of the hearer reader then that crosses the line as well that is lying
1642061 present information in a way that fundamentally alters the perception of the church
1642062 to one that benefits the church at the expense of the hearer reader
1642063 then that crosses the line as well that is lying
1642064 it has to do with the expectations of the mouthpiece some issues demand that they be taken off line or are better handled by unofficial surrogates
1642065 the question isnt whether the church whitewashes but why it does so and whether its justified
1642066 yes i did that but it was a huge mistake and i learned from it
1642067 my duty as a member of the council of the twelve is to protect what is most unique about the lds church namely the authority of priesthood testimony regarding the restoration of the gospel and the divine mission of the savior everything may be sacrificed in order to maintain the integrity of those essential facts thus if mormon enigma reveals information that is detrimental to the reputation of joseph smith then it is necessary to try to limit its influence and that of its authors
1642068 step back take a deep breath and consider how you would react if someone else spoke to you the way you are speaking to others i mean that seriously go back and read your comments as if they were written by someone else and directed at you i think it will be enlightening
1642069 i wouldnt say that we teach that as man is god once was
1642070 if he meant lies hes a lawyer i bet he would have said
1642071 it is like you have a list of issues next to you that you work into every comment on every thread
1642072 like you have a list of issues next to you that you work into every comment on every thread
1642073 while another is referring to a single comment made in an interview with a foreign journalist
1642074 i dont get dallin h oaks saying it is ok to attempt to discredit people who present factual evidence
1642075 everything may be sacrificed in order to maintain the integrity of those essential facts thus if mormon enigma reveals information that is detrimental to the reputation of joseph smith then it is necessary to try to limit its influence and that of its authors
1642076 a single comment made in an interview with a foreign journalist
1642077 when i last applied for a job did i list all of the negative things about myself on my resume when i was in the job interview did i tell them all of the ways id fallen short in previous jobs did i volunteer every reason why they should not hire me
1642078 there are many disclosures made to prospective converts though some of which definitely do weed out converts to wit word of wisdom law of chastity have to get married if living together tithing and the baptismal interview to name a few
1642079 all religions have goofy elements and unsavory elements to their histories thats the nature of religion
1642080 this will all be sorted out in the next life
1642081 joseph smith repeatedly said if he told us all he knew none would remain with the church
1642082 everything may be sacrificed in order to maintain the integrity of those essential facts thus if mormon enigma reveals information that is detrimental to the reputation of joseph smith then it is necessary to try to limit its influence and that of its authors
1642083 what gets those who still strive to go to church every week accept and serve in callings keep commandments youre not sure god really requires of us pay tithing attend meetings serve in the temple do fhe read scriptures listen to conference etc
1642084 it becomes trite not majestic when one tells a story like this it makes the atonement seem like a cheap parlor trick
1642085 god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son
1642086 the father in this story allowed his child to die to save a car of passengers he didnt know imagine how powerful a choice it would be if he knew and loved each of those people intimately like his son now some new info not only did the father allow something to happen he created the opportunity for his son to willingly die does that affect how you feel now imagine that the son and father know the passengers in the train will be killed and each knows that together they must work to save those passengers therefore the child is not an innocent victim at all but one who is giving himself to save those passengers do you think that changes the emotions that the father would be feeling how
1642087 i applaud your honesty and i would also not lie if pressed although i might demur
1642088 complete honesty is necessary for our salvation an apostle of the lord has said honesty is a principle of salvation in the kingdom of god just as no man or woman can be saved without baptism so no one can be saved without honesty mark e petersen in conference report oct 1971 p 63 or ensign dec 1971 p 72
1642089 god is honest and just in all things see alma 7 20 we too must be honest in all things to become like him the brother of jared testified yea lord i know that thou art a god of truth and canst not lie ether 3 12 in contrast the devil is a liar in fact he is the father of lies see 2 nephi 9 9 those who choose to cheat and lie and deceive and misrepresent become his slaves mark e petersen in conference report oct 1971 p 65 or ensign dec 1971 p 73
1642090 i applaud your honesty and i would also not lie if pressed although i might demur however i am still not sure its a valid parallel for church leaders
1642091 complete honesty is necessary for our salvation an apostle of the lord has said honesty is a principle of salvation in the kingdom of god just as no man or woman can be saved without baptism so no one can be saved without honesty mark e petersen in conference report oct 1971 p 63 or ensign dec 1971 p 72
1642092 god is honest and just in all things see alma 7 20 we too must be honest in all things to become like him the brother of jared testified yea lord i know that thou art a god of truth and canst not lie ether 3 12 in contrast the devil is a liar in fact he is the father of lies see 2 nephi 9 9 those who choose to cheat and lie and deceive and misrepresent become his slaves mark e petersen in conference report oct 1971 p 65 or ensign dec 1971 p 73
1642093 a peculiar people how mormonism both fits and denies classification in lamberts religion in american politics
1642094 jimmy carter had the centerpiece of his national family week celebration be his address in the tabernacle on temple square at mormon headquarters
1642095 once a moral issue enters the political arena it no longer is just a moral issue
1642096 the church has not favored or opposed legislative proposals or public demonstrations concerning abortion
1642097 sometimes two or more moral goods conflict with one another and decent people disagree about moral hierarchies or which course of action will do the least harm
1642098 we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals communities and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets we call upon responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society
1642099 few concepts have more potential to mislead us than the idea that choice or agency is an ultimate goal for latter day saints this potential confusion is partly a product of the fact that moral agency the right to choose is a fundamental condition of mortal life without this precious gift of god the purpose of mortal life could not be realized to secure our agency in mortality we fought a mighty contest but our war to secure agency was won the test in this postwar mortal estate is not to secure choice but to use it to choose good instead of evil so that we can achieve our eternal goals in mortality choice is a method not a goal if we say we are anti abortion in our personal life but pro choice in public policy we are saying that we will not use our influence to establish public policies that encourage righteous choices on matters gods servants have defined as serious sins i urge latter day saints who have taken that position to ask themselves which other grievous sins should be decriminalized or smiled on by the law due to this theory that persons should not be hampered in their choices should we decriminalize or lighten the legal consequences of child abuse of cruelty to animals of pollution of fraud of fathers who choose to abandon their families for greater freedom or convenience
1642100 god was once a man man can become a god
1642101 god himself was once as we are now and is an exalted man and sits enthroned in yonder heavens
1642102 have we had any serious doctrinal insight since joseph died our missionaries claim continual revelation as a pillar of our faith by is this really a distinguishing claim what about new sections to the d amp c
1642103 isnt that fair that we not be led to believe that we will become gods someday if we meaning church leadership are not quite sure anymore
1642104 bruce deification is central in its place revealing the purpose of life mans origin and destiny i think the scriptures would have a lot more of it if people werent so afraid of it it seems to me god wont reveal mysteries to people who cannot or will not accept them
1642105 this understanding of god is a product of something like a spiritual evolution of god who was once a man and moved into this very different kind of being
1642106 will you kindly explain these two expressions we know that there is a god in heaven who is infinite and eternal from everlasting to everlasting and as man is god was as god is man may become
1642107 teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught it is essential to learn the concepts of the lessons but these should not be taught by rote presentation the missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the spirit he should not give a memorized recitation but speak from the heart in his own terms he may depart from the order of the lessons giving that which he is inspired to do according to the interest and needs of the investigator
1642108 probably the greatest benefit of preach my gospel will be seen in the lives of returned missionaries who will be stronger parents more able church leaders and better professionals because of the growth that comes from understanding and applying its inspired content
1642109 i will step up to fill this important starting friday
1642110 my decision to leave the lds church wasnt about whether i felt loved there it was about whether i found truth there
1642111 i have a hard time understanding why someone would be offended by someone demonstrating genuine goodness and love to them regardless of whether they had an unspoken hope that one day that person returns to the church
1642112 george 4 6 10 11 13 i urge you to re read your comments with a particular focus on your tone and then ask yourself whether your approach is precisely the type of attitude that discourages apostates from becoming ex apostates
1642113 you know it wasnt that bad out there in fact im a better person for having experienced it
1642114 belong primarily because of the goodness and love i both receive and am able to give within the church
1642115 i like to bear my testimony andrew opened the door for me today shook my hand and hugged me therefore i know the church is true
1642116 die angaben des wetterdienstes waren so dass es vertretbar war auszulaufen
1642117 since we are born into conditions of mortality repentance comes to mean a turning of the heart and will to god of sin to which we are naturally inclined
1642118 be ye through what i have said so far complete whole fully developed even as your father which is in heaven is complete whole fully developed
1642119 become ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect
1642120 in a general sense i dont think anyone can ever fully repent in this life
1642121 19 and no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood because of their faith and the repentance of all their sins and their faithfulness unto the end
1642122 20 now this is the commandment repent all ye ends of the earth and come unto me and be baptized in my name that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the holy ghost that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day
1642123 1 and now i speak concerning baptism behold elders priests and teachers were baptized and they were not baptized save they brought forth fruit meet that they were worthy of it 2 neither did they receive any unto baptism save they came forth with a broken heart and a contrite spirit and witnessed unto the church that they truly repented of all their sins 3 and none were received unto baptism save they took upon them the name of christ having a determination to serve him to the end 4 and after they had been received unto baptism and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the holy ghost they were numbered among the people of the church of christ and their names were taken that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of god to keep them in the right way to keep them continually watchful unto prayer relying alone upon the merits of christ who was the author and the finisher of their faith
1642124 they were numbered among the people of the church of christ
1642125 17 wherefore do the things which i have told you i have seen that your lord and your redeemer should do for for this cause have they been shown unto me that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter
1642126 i asy unto you that is ye do this ye shall always rejice and be filled with the love of god and always retain a remission of your sins
1642127 murder adultery theft cursing unholiness in masters disobedience in servants unfaithfulness improvidence hatred of god disobedience to husbands lack of natural affection high mindedness flattery lustfulness infidelity indiscretion backbiting whispering lack of truth striking brawling quarrelsomeness unthankfulness inhospitality deceitfulness irreverence boasting arrogance pride double tongued talk profanity slander corruptness thievery embezzlement despoiling covenant breaking incontinence filthiness ignobleness filthy communications impurity foolishness slothfulness impatience lack of understanding unmercifulness idolatry blasphemy denial of the holy ghost sabbath breaking envy jealousy malice maligning vengefulness implacability bitterness clamor spite defiling reviling evil speaking provoking greediness for filthy lucre disobedience to parents anger hate covetousness bearing false witness inventing evil things fleshliness heresy presumptuousness abomination insatiable appetite instability ignorance self will speaking evil of dignitaries becoming a stumbling block and in our modern language masturbation petting fornication adultery homosexuality and every sex perversion every hidden and secret sin and all unholy and impure practices
1642128 there is never a day in any mans or womans life when repentance is not essential to his well being and eternal progress but when most of us think of repentance we tend to narrow our vision and view it as good only for our husbands our wives our parents our children our neighbors our friends the world anyone and everyone except ourselves similarly there is a prevalent perhaps subconscious feeling that the lord designed repentance only for those who commit murder or adultery or theft or other heinous crimes this is of course not so if we are humble and desirous of living the gospel we will come to think of repentance as applying to everything we do in life whether it be spiritual or temporal in nature repentance is for every soul who has not yet reached perfection
1642129 and let us not suppose that in calling people to repentance the prophets are concerned only with the more grievous sins such as murder adultery stealing and so on nor only with those persons who have not accepted the gospel ordinances all transgressions must be cleansed all weaknesses must be overcome before a person can attain perfection and godhood
1642130 ray i dont see anywhere in kimballs book where he limits his prerequisite six steps of repentance to forgiveness as pertaining only to
1642131 pray for and develop the characteristic of godliness that will remove your tendency to submit to the sin
1642132 since we are born into conditions of mortality repentance comes to mean a turning of the heart and will to god and a renunciation of sin to which we are naturally inclined
1642133 the highest good is not to seek to do good but to allow yourself to become it the ordinary person seeks to do good things and finds they cannot do them continually
1642134 we must just passively allow it to continue by forgiving it
1642135 top ten lds news stories of 2007 are not investigative journalism by any means
1642136 when the writers say that the hundredth part is not contained in the book they are not exaggerating at all
1642137 else what shall they do which are a baptized b for the dead if the dead c rise not at all why are they then baptized for the d dead
1642138 we recommend that people marry those who are of the same racial background generally and of somewhat the same economic and social and educational background some of those are not an absolute necessity but preferred and above all the same religious background without question
1642139 there are statements in our literature by the early brethren that we have interpreted to mean that the negroes would not receive the priesthood in mortality
1642140 you said such and such and how is it now that we do such and such
1642141 there is a temptation for the writer or the teacher of church history to want to tell everything whether it is worthy or faith promoting or not
1642142 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it
1642143 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which art in heaven is perfect
1642144 try not to make mistakes sin but realize it doesnt really matter in the long run
1642145 be ye therefore complete finished fully developed even as your father which art in heaven is complete finished fully developed
1642146 a group of persons surrounding or gathered out around a common center of interest
1642147 to reach a distant end to be fully developed to consummate or to finish
1642148 please give me a full explanation of how the first quote leads to the second quote
1642149 hey i was reading about this in the book of mormon the other day
1642150 or perhaps another explanation is in order joseph just didnt know the book of mormon very well because he wasnt the author of it and was too busy to really study it himself during his relatively short life
1642151 2 samuel 12 8 says that the lord indeed give these women to david and indicates that the lord would have given him more were it not for his sin and the rest of the chapter does indeed show that the lord is giving his wives unto another
1642152 i really get the feeling that joseph smith didnt know the book of mormon very well which is a bit odd if you think about it
1642153 or perhaps another explanation is in order joseph just didnt know the book of mormon very well because he wasnt the author of it and was too busy to really study it himself during his relatively short life
1642154 i gave you your masters house and your masters wives into your bosom and gave you the house of israel and of judah and if that had been too little i would have added as much more
1642155 i will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this very sun
1642156 i will raise up trouble against you from within your own house
1642157 many wives and concubines which thing was abominable before me
1642158 he would have given david more if he wanted more not he would have been given more if he didnt sin
1642159 clear allusion to absaloms rape of davids wives concubines in plain sight of all israel
1642160 more generally the punishment for davids sin was very clearly to be a civil war
1642161 the argument that the harmonization occurs because what the lord is condemning is unfaithfulness in plural marriage is just plain silly
1642162 i dont know how you get that adultery was the problem out of that
1642163 the bottom line is that i think that the proposed harmonization only succeeds if you flat out ignore what the scriptures are saying
1642164 and i gave thee thy masters house and thy masters wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel and of judah and if that had been too little i would moreover have given unto thee such and such things
1642165 i was talking about the scriptures im asking people how they feel about holy scripture saying the god gives wives to people like livestock you dont have to be a feminist to be uncomfortable with that
1642166 dude i think you need to realize that people arent judging you simply the idea
1642167 i gave you your masters house and your masters wives into your bosom and gave you the house of israel and of judah and if that had been too little i would have added as much more
1642168 when i read it i just cant accept that god actually said that or else i am not a fan of that god
1642169 are you trying to recruit for a mormon splinter group
1642170 if you would simply accept plural marriage as a holy behavior sanctioned by god when commanded and you wouldnt have to accuse god of sanctioning something unholy god sanctions plural marriage throughout the scriptures giving women to men as a blessing isnt treating them as livestock its a blessing to the man as well as to the woman
1642171 it is an immoral and abusive practice that only brought about misery and heartache to all those who tried to live it and it nearly destroyed the church
1642172 because the brethren know what an immoral and abuse thing it is and they want nothing to do with it
1642173 speaking in absolutes as did you i would say that polygamy is absolutely what saved the church from imploding your turn
1642174 and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach
1642175 1a ie because of scarcity of men due to wars
1642176 will polyandry be appropriate i mean whats good for the gander is good for the goose right
1642177 i still think clays argument hold merit in that fact that scriptures still holds female in lower esteem than the male
1642178 regardless of intent the practice will always be abused by someone or many someones it is human nature that if one participates in the subjugation of another group regardless of intent that eventual abuses will occur often egregious abuse
1642179 as i understand jacob 2 polygamy is an abominiation in almost all cases its that last 0 01 that were arguing over right
1642180 even when its better than the alternative its still not ideal
1642181 men and women have never been identical their roles have never been the same
1642182 i find your lack of faith in the genuine goodness of the majority of men more than a bit sad and stupid you sound like a typical liberal democrat whiner to me that is trying to force the commie type of equality on things that were never identical
1642183 as i understand jacob 2 polygamy is an abominiation in almost all cases its that last 0 01 that were arguing over right
1642184 even when its better than the alternative its still not ideal
1642185 i have to agree that most of the theories nm tony mentions have huge holes
1642186 i find that many of the arguments presented for why god needs polygamy or why humanity needs polygamy to be groundless
1642187 if i understand you correctly you are saying you agree that it wasnt done in an ideal way here on earth or if it was cases were rare due to our human ness
1642188 why is that why is it a celestial law for only the males
1642189 and i ask where is the equality for the women in polygamous marriages
1642190 the women are yoked to the plow in the polygamous relationship and the man is the driver
1642191 this is a simple ad hominem attack that shows a lack of faith in your argument
1642192 i am simply stating the obvious that in every case a minority or a group of people has been subjugated abuses occur
1642193 show me where i am wrong and i will reevaluate my stance
1642194 this still does not address the issue nor the questions i have asked
1642195 you dont happen to already be a fundamentalist are you
1642196 bruce well count your comments but im not so sure about dude moey bob whipple who are all the same person trust me nice job dude on really doing a great job defending your position with mature comments and behavior you crossed a line bro
1642197 have been trying to retire this stupid psydonym sic gradually and accidentally didnt switch to my new guy
1642198 sounds like you are doing the same thing that this clay guy did do this dude guy
1642199 you spoke in the alternate personalities as if they were separate people
1642200 maybe to generate a false sense of support for your position i dont know its pretty silly
1642201 doug g let me take this as a jumping off point back to the original point of the post
1642202 you suggested that the book or mormon might be inspired
1642203 i cant say i have a problem with this tactic
1642204 i certainly can see the point youre making about all the places in the bom that werent changed regarding the godhead and why you find it significant that despite this confusion there are a couple of scriptures which do hint at our current understanding
1642205 and also to the convincing of the jew and gentile that jesus is the christ the eternal god
1642206 but for those that are interested one of the places that joseph
1642207 and also to the convincing of the jew and gentile that jesus is the christ the eternal god
1642208 what is the book of mormon really teaching about deity
1642209 what can i learn from its insistence that jesus is our eternal father
1642210 what can i learn from its insistence that jesus is both father and son
1642211 why is it so insistent that jesus the father and the holy ghost are all one god why does this point matter so much that it comes up over and over in both the book of mormon and the bible more so in the book of mormon
1642212 bruce nielson i was just responding to doug g who was certain that word print studies were the definite answer
1642213 the apologists say it was to clarify which member of the godhead trinity was being referred to this strikes me as a better theory in that it at least fits all the current facts though i wouldnt say thats the final word either
1642214 bevor sie das hier in der session ansprechen sollten sie es in der mitgliederversammlung ihres verbandes kl ren
1642215 am i feeling the years those years that have brought me to midlife am i wearing down
1642216 am i feeling the fear the fear of stereotypes the fear of being defined limited by a number
1642217 and the fear itself is limiting me narrowing the opportunities i see
1642218 and as i spake concerning the convincing of the jews that jesus is the very christ it must needs be that the gentiles be convinced also
1642219 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god definition 2 and the word was god
1642220 i have a key by which i understand the scriptures i enquire sic what was the question which drew out the answer or caused jesus to utter the parable to ascertain its meaning we must dig up the root and ascertain what it was that drew the saying out of jesus
1642221 be bringing forth good works to be in the state of being saved
1642222 and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good
1642223 hear o israel the lord our god definition 1 2 or 3 is one lord
1642224 hear o israel the lord our god definition 1 is one unity
1642225 it was a laundry list of mormon doctrines they dont believe in a type of negative self labeling by labeling another
1642226 ive finally realized that its because about halfway through he changes his definition of faith and i dont think he realizes that the twain are different
1642227 in truth the meaning of words can shift a little or a lot between groups cultures over time and
1642228 a person can be inconsistent within a single conversation without even realizing it
1642229 and the god mormons worship is simply the latest in an endless line of gods the product of an infinite regression of men gods
1642230 oh lord deliver us in due time from the little narrow prison almost as it were total darkness of paper pen and ink and a crooked broken scattered and imperfect language
1642231 i saw god the father and his son jesus christ the resurrected lord standing in front of me in the air i saw the prints of the nails in the saviors hands and feet as he stood before me and told me that all other christians on the earth were wrong and that i should do everything in my power to build up a true church unto him so that his return to the earth could be ushered in through the power of the priesthood
1642232 i was answered that i must join none of them for they were all wrong and the personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight
1642233 i was answered that i must join none of them for they were all wrong and jesus said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight
1642234 yeah i guess words are so imprisoning that js couldnt come right out and say
1642235 the first spoke calling me by name and said pointing to the other this is my beloved son
1642236 id say exposing js for the fraud that he was helps all who seek the truth about mormonism
1642237 given my own experiences with overpowering spiritual experiences im fairly certain he walked out of that grove with his head spinning literally reeling from what had happened
1642238 and after 18 years js was still reeling from the experience to the point he couldnt write the account using more direct verbiage give me a break
1642239 ive noticed that when a challenge to mormonism is made you revert to this
1642240 im not going to discount your spiritual experiences but i wonder how the spiritual experiences of the muslim jew or buddhist measure up to yours
1642241 just because a person wants to believe in something doesnt mean that something is true
1642242 having said that defenders of mormonism like to point out that js was this simple farm boy with little to no formal education seems to me that someone so simple would be straight forward in his manner of describing significant events from his life rather than some nuanced round about way of speaking we know js is capable of referring directly to jesus and god the father from other visions js supposedly had why is this one any different
1642243 i will preach on the plurality of gods i wish to declare that i have always and in all congregations when i preached on the subject of the deity it has been the plurality of gods it has been preached by the elders for fifteen years i have always declared god the father to be a distinct personage jesus christ a separate and distinct personage from god the father and the holy spirit was a distinct personage and a spirit and these three constitute three distinct personages and three gods if this is in accordance with the new testament lo and behold we have three gods anyhow and they are plural and who can contradict it
1642244 ray am i really misrepresenting what mormons believe or are you
1642245 oh yeah we believe in the trinity just like the other christians
1642246 and honor be to the father and to the son and to the holy ghost which is one god amen
1642247 if any man does not know god and inquires what kind of a being he is if he will search diligently his own heart if the declaration of jesus and the apostles be true he will realize that he has not eternal life for there can be eternal life on no other principle
1642248 here then is eternal life to know the only wise and true god and you have got to learn how to be gods yourselves and to be kings and priests to god the same as all gods have done before you namely by going from one small degree to another and from a small capacity to a great one from grace to grace from exaltation to exaltation until you attain to the resurrection of the dead and are able to dwell in everlasting burnings and to sit in glory as do those who sit enthroned in everlasting power and i want you to know that god in the last days while certain individuals are proclaiming his name is not trifling with you or me
1642249 any explanation saying mormons believe there is only one god is a complete misrepresenation of the lds faith
1642250 the answer your 1 3 1 3 1 3 question is simple jesus is both fully god and fully man
1642251 this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man
1642252 the father has promised through the son that all that he has shall be given to those who are obedient to his commandments they shall increase in knowledge wisdom and power going from grace to grace until the fulness of the perfect day shall burst upon them
1642253 in explaining the trinity ill be the first to admit it is a complex subject hard to understand looking at god from our human persepective is very difficult you cant drag god down to the human level of understanding and explain him at human terms
1642254 okay if you insist on defining the trinity as polytheistic i dont mind call it whatever you want giving you the full benefit of the doubt you are limited to three gods
1642255 why did you avoid answering my question on how you can simultaneously believe in one god and that man can become god
1642256 okay if you insist on defining the trinity as polytheistic i dont mind call it whatever you want
1642257 i read the bible to mean there are only 3 persons in one god and that will never change and if mormons believe in more than 3 persons in that one god then i disagree with them
1642258 where did the concept of becoming a god originate where is it spoken of in the bible and who spoke it
1642259 read the bible with an open mind avoiding the negative influence of the lds false teachings
1642260 i claim mormons believe something that mormons say they dont believe
1642261 oh yeah we believe in the trinity just like the other christians
1642262 however mormons do not believe that there is only one god
1642263 in consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days i have cwarned you and forewarn you by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation
1642264 the idea someone who likes a cup of coffee in the mornings is unworthy of the temple and therefore salvation
1642265 where has it ever been taught that a temple recommend equals salvation or that lack of a temple recommend equals damnation
1642266 is the wow purely a mandate to live a healthy lifestyle
1642267 over eating is a gross violation of the word of wisdom
1642268 we need no accountability that becomes intercession between us and god to pronounce us worthy or grant access to salvation
1642269 i give you permission to speak truth into my life to hold me accountable to that which i have committed
1642270 adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints who are or can be called saints
1642271 weakest of all saints who are or can be called saints
1642272 this is not the ideal but its what i want my saints to live
1642273 we are asked to judge for ourselves and god accords us an individual wider berth than some in the roman audience considered okay but yet for the benefits of ones brothers and sisters in the community one should be willing to limit ones individual practice where needed
1642274 happy is he who doesnt condemn himself in things that are allowed
1642275 kingdom of god that is neither meat nor drink but righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost
1642276 there are any number of people i know personally who live as close to the principles of the word of wisdom as they can but still have
1642277 husband and wife talk and find something they agree on then the husband makes the decision
1642278 the article points out that womens standards for housework are significantly higher than mens therefore women will work harder to meet those standards while men will desist when their own threshold for cleanliness is reached
1642279 far more housework done by women while more men take the burden of handling finances
1642280 well at least i earn the money in this family what do you do all day
1642281 i cant help being a little suspicious about this article
1642282 you know i cant give my permission without talking to mom you also know we generally dont make decisions like that the same day you ask us we need time to think and talk about it what can you do to rearrange it for next week or this weekend
1642283 this is what a b and c family members are going to go do you are welcome to come as well but i thought you others might prefer doing this activity instead and we can meet up again afterwards
1642284 its easier to understand the other persons perspective in a same sex relationship
1642285 the study concludes that its easier to understand the other persons perspective in a same sex relationship
1642286 childcare related tasks skew even more toward women a 5 to 1 ratio
1642287 men are more likely to initiate sex while women may refuse sex
1642288 the study concludes that its easier to understand the other persons perspective in a same sex relationship
1642289 they pay attention to what each other is feeling and respect those feelings they treat one another and speak to one another accordingly theyre actually committed to making each other happy or to put it another way they avoid selfishness
1642290 even as a nearly fundamentalist believing mormon i hated going to church on fathers day
1642291 we have to hurry and pick up the maids are coming
1642292 same sex couples burdens for initiating both sex and difficult conversations are more equally shared
1642293 are gender roles really eternal did i really sign up to do laundry in the pre existence
1642294 they pay attention to what each other is feeling and respect those feelings they treat one etc
1642295 you need to have a chat with your employers human resource department
1642296 they said he didnt participate in the ward enough hadnt been to church enough and hadnt gone in and asked for a calling
1642297 the tribune show the issue has pitted university officials and the athletic department who back walton by almost every account against the very church that runs it
1642298 this is a soul not a nobody its a sad sad situation that somebody is trying to make an example out of my son
1642299 they said he didnt participate in the ward enough hadnt been to church enough and hadnt gone in and asked for a calling
1642300 his roommate and teammate jake wortham said he witnessed walton attend church
1642301 step in the bishop the bishop has a thing against athletes generally and kent in particular kent has not show deference to him the bishop has justified has hard line because the gospel is more important than sports and he has seen too many athletes get away with too much he is sick of it kent has been warned by the bishop but has not taken it seriously
1642302 i hope you dont hurt your son by making a big issue out of this
1642303 also the story is in the trib not exactly a friend to the church
1642304 because of its church affiliation and the chance to be around people who share my beliefs
1642305 dont damage your sons testimony or spiritual relationship with the church by turning this into a family grudge
1642306 im so much better than you because i am so churchy
1642307 have you done and will you continue to do your duty in the church attend your meetings and abide by the rules and standards of the church
1642308 time and again jesus showed that he was a creature separate from god and that he jesus had a god above him a god whom he worshiped a god whom he called
1642309 the bibles position is clear not only is almighty god jehovah a personality separate from jesus but he is at all times his superior jesus is always presented as separate and lesser a humble servant of god
1642310 as in the heavens they all agree the records given there by three on earth three witnesses are given to lead the sons of earth to heaven jehovah god the father is one another gods eternal son the spirit does with them agree the witnesses in heaven are three
1642311 mark this august wonder of the age the mormons build not temples to the name of jesus but to the name of jehovah not to the son but to the father temples to the most high god the scepter not the cross
1642312 this is the second time that ive seen comments in the bloggernacle suggesting that the second anointing is merely
1642313 no wonder they have to keep on knocking on doors
1642314 the future status of the book of mormon in the community of christ
1642315 we have the archives open and now this will close them
1642316 the temple of the melchizedek priesthood will be built when the fragments of the church reunite and the saints are called to zion
1642317 and finally i think the apologetic war over the bom will never go anywhere useful
1642318 oh that was their personal opinion that is not official church doctrine
1642319 i doubt science or archaeology could ever disprove that there was once a small band of israelites in the americas
1642320 so the shift which is taking place is not about book of mormon history it is about evaluating things said by past or current prophets on the one hand this should be embraced because racist and sexist statements by early church leaders can thus be ignored on the other hand what use is a prophet who has not the slightest idea about who god is but simply babbles his personal opinion and world view
1642321 however the prophets are supposed to be inspired and they are supposed to be guided by revelation from god himself
1642322 what may be truly scary here is how many times hes been shown to be wrong in mormon doctrine
1642323 the book of mormon is a record of the forefathers of our western tribes of indians
1642324 for example there is still room to say that the tribes where pure lamanite until a remnant of the eskimos came south and over took them in 450ad example not fact adding the asian gene into the blood line
1642325 my question though is how on earth did mcconkie get to add an introduction to the bom thats where the real issue lies
1642326 i want to believe that the church is true and as long as i can find plausible deniability to any counter claims i will continue choosing to believe
1642327 consequently i wish that non believers would simply speak to each other or stick to discussing things like sports or other hobbies because so much is at stake when you try to talk people out of their beliefs i dont think anyone benefits from such an engagement
1642328 but to convince someone to stop believing who does that help
1642329 in my mind belief is a choice and one that takes a great deal of effort to maintain
1642330 you know its sad but poor brother peg doesnt believe in the restored gospel because he just doesnt want it bad enough maybe someday hell make that choice and then he can rejoin the chosen people
1642331 that its wrong to criticize leaders of the church even if the criticism is true because it diminishes their effectiveness as a servant of the lord one can work to correct them by some other means but dont go about saying that they misbehaved when they were a youngster or whatever
1642332 i am arguing that the current churchs hardline stance on literal historicity and the current churchs dogmatic demands of absolute obedience to the leaders who have been shown to be fallible on matters both central and peripheral to the gospel are untenable
1642333 the issue is the isolation that believers create for themselves and others by making this and other topics off limits families would all be better off if they could learn to discuss the church including current counsel by leaders without the unnecessary accusation that being on the other side of oaks or mcconkie is somehow diminishing god or his capacity
1642334 you might want to try actually reading a book by an actual scientist on the matter before revealing such a stunning level of ignorance seriously
1642335 joseph smith was very emphatic that a prophet is only a prophet when acting as such
1642336 so rather than attacking the informed mormon position they appealed to what the naive lay member thought
1642337 beware of those who would pit the dead prophets against the living prophets for the living prophets always take precedence
1642338 the errors in manuals should be taken as the churchs official position
1642339 the prophet tells us what we need to know not always what we want to know
1642340 that a prophet is only a prophet when acting as such
1642341 is this change a big deal or much ado about nothing
1642342 they knew this so rather than attacking the informed mormon position they appealed to what the naive lay member thought ignoring the fact that one could take any doctrinal point in the church and find a significant number of mormons with incorrect ideas on it heck even on basic narrative notions of the book of mormon stories ask the average mormon questions to distinguish sidney rigdon from martin harris and see how many right answers you get for instance
1642343 the idea that a rogue artist offering his or her own inaccurate view of a church historical event could get it past correlation is absolutely laughable for those advancing this view please tell me you seriously think the church would choose a picture of joseph with his head in hat over the one that shows him and oliver sitting by candlelight with joseph running his finger along the gold plates
1642344 have a responsibility to be candid and forthright about its history
1642345 i would not give a fig for the simplicity this side of complexity but i would give my life for the simplicity on the other side of complexity
1642346 i love the discussion of whether the church is or should be responsible for helping adult church members move from one level to another
1642347 religion is not identical with spirituality rather religion is the form spirituality takes in civilization
1642348 perhaps the greatest problem with this word is the line it seems to imply between spirit and flesh
1642349 as a people we are in the habit of saying that we believe in latter day revelation
1642350 one day one of them turned to me and told me that i was more christian than any other person shed met
1642351 believest thou faith cognitive dissonance and the psychology of religious experience
1642352 that despite my wrestling and struggles i believe because i believe
1642353 they have not believed god when he told them that ours is a lonely dreary world where we will surely die and they have chosen instead to believe another version of reality one which claims that they can be protected from being molested disappointed or made afraid they have been angry at god or other church leaders for not keeping promises which god has not in fact made
1642354 if you need your house of cards knocked down then get it knocked down as fast as possible so you can start rebuilding
1642355 lesbian and gay christians working within the church of england are entitled to be treated with humanity
1642356 were delighted that the tribunal has sent such a robust signal both to the bishop and other employers
1642357 the substantial level of compensation sends out a very clear message not even a bishop is above this law
1642358 we are glad we can draw a line under this unhappy situation it has been a difficult time for all of us involved in the tribunal
1642359 it has been a long drawn out process and we are pleased that it is finally complete
1642360 we are now aware that when making such an appointment we must make it clear if it is a genuine occupational requirement that the post holder should believe in and uphold the christian belief and ideal of marriage and that sexual relationships are confined to marriage this is the crux of the matter not sexual orientation
1642361 we are now aware that when making such an appointment we must make it clear if it is a genuine occupational requirement that the post holder should believe in and uphold the christian belief and ideal of marriage and that sexual relationships are confined to marriage this is the crux of the matter not sexual orientation
1642362 we are now aware that when making such an appointment we must make it clear if it is a genuine occupational requirement that the post holder should believe in and uphold the christian belief and ideal of marriage and that sexual relationships are confined to marriage this is the crux of the matter not sexual orientation
1642363 the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
1642364 look god if you want him dead just stop his heart and ill get the clothes and do the rest
1642365 go ahead and whack off my head i think before i break my marriage vows to emma i better have a long talk with god
1642366 who my zoram no hes worked for me for years wait a minute it mustve been those pesky kids who were asking for them a few days ago after em
1642367 if god had really wanted laban dead he certainly was capable of doing his own dirty work here
1642368 2 i didnt like in wait for him but god delivered him into my hands
1642369 2 i didnt like in wait for him but god delivered him into my hands
1642370 but above all for us mormons id say that its an aberration to claim that god does dirty work
1642371 well now youre allowing everyone to do whatever they want so long as they say god said so
1642372 remember how merciful the lord hath been unto the children of men from the creation of adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things and ponder it in your hearts
1642373 to make clear or evident to the eye or the understanding show plainly
1642374 also nearly all of the solid conversions i experienced in japan were a direct result of the book of mormon among those who read the entire thing and did exactly what it asked them to do
1642375 the days of suffering must shortened were it not so all life must perish
1642376 go kill everyone in that city even the innocent babies the animals and the old people
1642377 that seems harsh lord why cant we just let some of them live kill only the soldiers and men well raise the children as our own
1642378 i have required this thing of thee so that those children may come unto me and rest from the torment of their days and so that the blood of the innocent may cry up from the ground as a testament as to the wickedness of their fathers and so that the disease which doth issue forth from that place shall not spread forth into the land
1642379 i dont believe it and you dont have to either no matter who says it
1642380 i know some of you have taken this class to get away from the lds church but i hope that what you have learned here will help eventually bring you back towards it
1642381 never allow your testimony to be based upon an individual when they fall you will fall right along with them
1642382 when something happens that hurts your feelings makes you angry or offends you and it will happen it does not matter what happened it is how you handle it that becomes critical that person may be a complete idiot you may be 100 justified but you have to decide if it is worth losing all of your blessings just to prove a point leaving the church means allowing satan to win he sits back and has a great laugh at your expense denying the church means that you are selfishly willing to not only sacrifice your own personal exaltation and happiness but also that of your children and all future generations to come how awful to have to look them all in the eye someday and be held accountable for that
1642383 what to expect when youre expecting a co wife why american muslims dont care to legalize polygamy
1642384 those are the types of writers and stories that i dont care for writers that are trying to get thier point across through thier stories
1642385 with this she punched me in the arm lovingly of course
1642386 the standards commonly upheld in a society as being what the people in that society believe to be proper
1642387 i stopped reading most academic treatises on the subject quite a few years ago and instead focused on talking with and listening to gay people i admire and respect
1642388 the only sin lies in hurting other people unnecessarily hurting yourself isnt sinful just stupid
1642389 we believe that men will be punished for their own sins and not for adams transgression
1642390 in the case of homosexuality i am getting the feeling that the real reason behind the churchs efforts to not legitimize and legalize sexuality between members of the same sex is that that will undermine the sinful nature of the act it will make it harder to claim that act as a sin
1642391 how deeply ingrained are the urges associated with sin transgression and morality for each person
1642392 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it
1642393 how is your recurring seemingly unconquerable weakness different for you than homosexuality is for others
1642394 seeking our own will instead of the will of god thus distorting our relationship with god with other people and with all creation
1642395 as a general authority i have the responsibility to preach general principles when i do i dont try to define all the exceptions there are exceptions to some rules for example we believe the commandment is not violated by killing pursuant to a lawful order in an armed conflict but dont ask me to give an opinion on your exception i only teach the general rules whether an exception applies to you is your responsibility you must work that out individually between you and the lord
1642396 the standards commonly upheld in a society as being what the people in that society believe to be proper
1642397 evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society counsel us to be most hesitant before interpreting the eighth amendment to allow the extension of the death penalty a hesitation that has special force where no life was taken in the commission of the crime
1642398 what religions christian or non christian would be better off if the mormon beliefs turned out to be true instead of their own beliefs being true which religions would be worse off
1642399 it would seem that hinduism is monotheistic contrary to populary belief btw
1642400 would the christians of the world feel disappointed that their substance theology wasnt true
1642401 hi im joseph smith and im responsible for welcoming new spirits into the spirit world i dont always do it personally but i try to make an exception for the people that really went out of their way to spread lies about me in their life i just want to let you know that i forgive you oh and by the way moroni is showing the golden plates to an audience right now so in a bit ill come back and well go have a look in the mean time your family would like to talk with you
1642402 welcome dear sister id like you to meet someone right now this man has recently entered into his eternal exaltation and is working very hard to move the work forward i know your husband hasnt been faithful in the gospel in fact hes left the church and publishes material against it regularly but this good brother has accepted the gospel and i think that you might be sealed to him his name is genghis khan
1642403 welcome brother i see you have met your family but now it time for you to answer a few questions tell me something how are you doing without your body youve always said you hated your body but now that you are just a spirit how do you feel
1642404 what would they think about being right about jesus but wrong about substance theology
1642405 you see what im trying to say is that if the christians of today reject the real jesus just like the jews rejected the real jehovah when he showed up then they are certain to still do that when he returns for the millennium
1642406 please give me a full explanation of how the first quote leads to the second quote
1642407 saying that you know the book of mormon better than the guy that translated it is borderline silly at best smug at worst
1642408 in any case its hard to even know what you are getting at without really understanding what your position is
1642409 when they use the same example in two different ways you have a contradiction on your hands
1642410 no i do not understand mormons as fitting your definition of henotheism
1642411 all the cities which are very far off from thee
1642412 and what if they realized that the mormons were right all along
1642413 at age 80 president monson is one of the youngest men to become church president in the past quarter century president hinckley was 84 and presidents howard w hunter and ezra taft benson were 86 president spencer w kimball became president dec 30 1973 at the age of 78
1642414 imagine a general conference address delivered from the pulpit in spanish that would be awesome
1642415 monson at age 80 is actually quite young for an lds church president in part because he became an apostle at the age of 36 the last man to be ordained in his 30s since world war ii the president of the lds church has been younger than 80 for only 8 out of 63 years 12 of the time all of which were prior to 1975 for a remarkable 27 out of 63 years in the post ww2 era 42 of the time the lds church president has been age 90 or older
1642416 16 peter its my partner mikes research hes produced a database of lds general authorities and analyzed the tenures and trends hes threatening to write a dialogue article that gives the actuarial chance each apostle has to become church president im trying to prod him to do it because i think people would find that fascinating
1642417 the cooks moved to hillsborough california where they had three children cook worked for 27 years as a corporate attorney becoming a managing partner of carr mcclellan ingersoll thompson and horn in the san francisco bay area for three years as president and chief executive officer of california healthcare system chs and then for some time citation needed as vice chairman of sutter health system his tenure at chs was marked by controversy as he orchestrated the lease of the once public marin general hospital the lease resulted in the transfer of millions of dollars of public funds to chs 2 cook also volunteered for 14 years as city attorney

1642419 isnt it interesting that those who criticize joseph smith for having so many various versions for the first vision have no problem accepting different versions of whatever
1642420 pseudo intellectuals who like hearing themselves talk but lack serious academic rigor
1642421 my client the corporation of the president has asked me to explain that they have detailed records related to church history which they do not wish to disclose thank you i am not taking any more questions
1642422 that is available in public documents my client does not wish to disclose any details no comment no comment no comment
1642423 in latin america do you think the saints really need to be told in sunday school that joseph smith used peep stone or had polygamous wives or should we find a way to improve their lives through opportunity like the perpetual education fund
1642424 how to reduce lds divorces how to reduce lds suicide how to increase volunteerism among youth
1642425 he stated that as a result of scientific surveys of the membership they will be addressing issues that many or some find challenging through official publication
1642426 in latin america do you think the saints really need to be told in sunday school that joseph smith used peep stone or had polygamous wives or should we find a way to improve their lives through opportunity like the perpetual education fund
1642427 are we worried that someone learn about the mmm or that temples are brought to the people and buildings to meet in or that local priesthood leadership be trained do we spend the priorities of the general leadership of the church in teaching difficult issues or bringing training to the world
1642428 general smiths views of the powers and policy of the government of the united states
1642429 committee of 76 worked to create a third party ticket of benson for president and outspoken segregationist strom thurmond for vp
1642430 era when the separation of church and state were still absolute
1642431 because romney was a vocal supporter of civil rights for blacks in the face of the lds churchs active opposition
1642432 the church is ultimate goal is to ensure its survival and challenging violent institutions such as states is a perfect way to ensure this goal is not met
1642433 if george romney was brainwashed in vietnam it was because he brought too light a load to the dryer
1642434 i think that it would have been totally appropriate to leave nazi germany or refuse to fight on its side in wwii as a latter day saint
1642435 winters should be mild or cookies more nourishing than vegetables
1642436 i believe in a higher power but not one of the ones represented by any world religion
1642437 the attitude or belief that a particular doctrine culture or social system is superior to and should triumph over all others
1642438 doctrine culture or social system is superior to and should triumph over triumphalism
1642439 everyone should just believe what they believe and introspect based on that we should never try to covert people to our personal beliefs
1642440 isnt that what you are doing to me right now with that very comment
1642441 what an incredibly great thing for that missionary to bring additional options to the people of that island so that they had more options to choose from
1642442 all religions can bring you closer to god though not in equal measures
1642443 bah ull h described a greater covenant between god and mankind he also described a lesser covenant between each messenger and the people of the time
1642444 the progressing soul becomes at one with god formless independent of time and substance though still aware of personal identity
1642445 i am a christian and a follower of my savior
1642446 one of the many who expect to sit at the right hand of god and believe that those who fail to share their ideas are doomed to eternal torment in many ways these are the most backward souls of all
1642447 all religions can bring you closer to god though not in equal measures
1642448 that there is no people to whom a prophet has not been sent
1642449 the all knowing physician hath his finger on the pulse of mankind he perceiveth the disease and prescribeth in his unerring wisdom the remedy every age hath its own problem and every soul its particular aspiration the remedy the world needeth in its present day afflictions can never be the same as that which a subsequent age may require be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements
1642450 yes if your view is that ultimate truth is so profound that its impossible to actually put it together into a meaningful or more meangingful form then yes i see your point
1642451 i hope youll see this as a bridge between our views for i believe it is or could be
1642452 all we can hope for is for god to bring us home
1642453 members who attend priesthood or relief society meetings but not sacrament meeting
1642454 but woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days
1642455 finally where does the profit from deseret book sales go i mean if you buy a book by a ga where does that money go
1642456 byu presidents make pennies compared to their colleagues at other institutions
1642457 gas make much less than they would make in similar positions of leadership in the business world most of them left
1642458 their salaries testify of their commitment to the church and the gospel not the other way around
1642459 that position is a supervisory position overseeing seminary instruction in multiple locations and generally teaching or at the very least overseeing institute instruction in multiple locations as well
1642460 i used to work as a full time church auditor the first presidency pull down salaries of 425 000 per year each and also full health insurance life insurance and other perts including a brand new chauffered limousine and of course all expenses paid on church business president hinckley has an office that takes up nearly half of one of the church office building floors complete with expensive hardwoods marble in the sinks and all of the other amenities that would say you were in the presence of the pope and not in the presence of a humble apostle of the lord apostles pull down 125 000 per year in salary and of course the same benefits as the first presidency seventies are at 72 000 per year in salary plus benefits now some of these men refuse to accept any salary from the church as they are independently wealthy having acquired their own wealth in their own businesses but for the most part that is not the case now i actually audited church records up on the 16th floor of the church auditing department but never actually audited these records i was just told about them
1642461 whom i have chosen from among you to minister unto you and to be your servants
1642462 yet the one thing i feel is great about tithing is that its always the same regardless of what you make 10 on a thousand or a million its not a wealth redistribution model
1642463 you may say im a dreamer but im not the only one
1642464 your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams
1642465 a ball that he said he saw flying in the air
1642466 oh ok i must be on the right track if ive now reached this point about which i earlier dreamed
1642467 why it is that we do not see more angels have more visions that we do not see greater and more manifestations of power
1642468 if you saw the following bro joseph after which many of the brethren saw a heavenly vision of the savior and concourses of angels and many other things of which each one has a record of what he saw would you really say good riddance if you saw something like this are you saying good riddance because you think they were whipped up to believe they saw something
1642469 i have dreamed a dream in other words i have seen a vision
1642470 behold he hath heard my cry by day and he hath given me knowledge by visions in the night time
1642471 how can i say i know this church is true before i know all the others to be false
1642472 and an angel of the lord came unto me snatching me up from my place of slumber and took me on high and higher still betwixt the air itself
1642473 the three principles by which man has been deceived throughout all of history
1642474 the 3 steps or principles by which man has been deceived
1642475 did you know you woke up under the egyptian presence because you were naked under a sheet
1642476 some anti sites dismiss claims of spiritual feeling within the church as being similar to what one might experience watching a romantic movie or a particularly touching long distance commercial these comparisons have nothing in common ime with an actual spiritual experience
1642477 i may have even been a little more generous at 80 20
1642478 resplendent beauty or magnificence a state of great splendor magnificence or prosperity a state of absolute happiness gratification contentment
1642479 to elevate or idealize to cause to be or seem more glorious or excellent than is actually the case
1642480 be or seem more glorious or excellent than is actually the case
1642481 be or seem more glorious or excellent than is actually the case
1642482 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord
1642483 there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another
1642484 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect
1642485 this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man
1642486 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven
1642487 i see in the lds worldview a humanity where free will is exalted perhaps too greatly and our complete dependence on god tempered a little too far with a distaste for addressing the fall in the same sense of separation and deprivation
1642488 jfq i also see this too much in the perspectives of too many members but i dont see it in the actual teachings of the restored gospel
1642489 the duraheart gives us a new third generation option for patients with advanced heart failure who need help to allow them to survive until they can receive a heart transplant
1642490 this trial will test the durahearts potential to overcome some of the issues that have been seen with other devices including hemolysis caused by shear stress on red blood cells and clotting risk caused by blood that does not circulate rapidly enough from all areas of the chamber
1642491 it also remains to be seen if this device offers superior durability which might make it useful as a destination therapy that could remove the need for a heart transplant
1642492 i think im going to make put x amount of mass in the nose cone
1642493 i wonder what big sin he committed that is keeping him from taking the sacrament
1642494 the limitation of priesthood responsibilities to men is a tribute to the incomparable place of women in the plan of salvation
1642495 as for brigham youngs statement about the blood of cain i dont consider this false doctrine
1642496 the lord hasnt revealed all there is to know about the whys and wherefores of blacks and the priesthood but to rush to judgment on a prophet and say he was mislead a fool or something worse is wrong headed
1642497 for their abuse of the black african race the whites will be cursed unless they repent
1642498 the lord hasnt revealed all there is to know about the whys and wherefores of blacks and the priesthood
1642499 13 who cares in this context he was raised in a bigoted time and environment he was wrong what he said should be forgotten
1642500 less acceptable are the responses that we normally get from the church
1642501 the lord hasnt revealed all there is to know about this
1642502 we shouldnt rush to say that the prophet was misled
1642503 in fact its very hard to parse his words and reach that conclusion
1642504 does it logically follow then that our current leaders are uninspired sexists and homophobes who are similarly products of their time they are teaching us yesterdays stuff rather than tomorrows stuff
1642505 it seems like we are constantly having to play believe both sides of an argument
1642506 these were the burning questions of the time 1950s amp 60s brown v board of education et al
1642507 they dont bring enlightenment on these key issues of our time because they are products of an unenightened era
1642508 it seems we should look to them for enlightenment on settled matters i e matters that dont require enlightenment
1642509 some of the policies regarding race that were set in place in the 1850s were influenced by the times and were wrong
1642510 we sure could have used enlightened leadership and direction from gods spokesman but we didnt get it
1642511 we simply expect different things from our prophets if i reject our modern prophets because they were spectacularly wrong on certain things while being incredibly inspired on others then there have been no legitimate prophets in the history of the world
1642512 if we criticize by and brm for their incorrect speculation then criticize pres hinckley and current leaders for their unwillingness to speculate we have created an un winnable situation they are damned if they do and damned if they dont
1642513 the ban was not gods will and was the result solely of human racism
1642514 one clear cut position is that the folklore must never be perpetuated
1642515 it probably would have been advantageous to say nothing to say we just dont know and as with many religious matters whatever was being done was done on the basis of faith at that time
1642516 all i can say is however well intended the explanations were i think almost all of them were inadequate and or wrong
1642517 there was no recorded revelation received that explained the ban
1642518 i believe personally that god allowed the ban to exist and continue as long as it did specifically because he is so gracious and merciful and loving toward his children
1642519 i would have a very hard time worshiping the god you describe
1642520 we simply do not know why that practice that policy that doctrine was in place
1642521 so the ban was doctrine according to the dictionary but not according to the mormon use of the term
1642522 hey brigham your job is to show love not hate
1642523 your issue i believe is much more fundamental than the priesthood ban and the claims of mormonism generally i believe it deals more broadly with the very existence of god as we conceive of him
1642524 the church is either true or its a complete fraud there is no middle ground
1642525 we talk of obedience but do we require any man or woman to ignorantly obey the counsels that are given do the first presidency require it no never
1642526 president wilford woodruff is a man of wisdom and experience and we respect him but we do not believe his personal views or utterances are revelations from god and when thus saith the lord comes from him the saints investigate it they do not shut their eyes and take it down like a pill
1642527 i do not wish any latter day saint in this world nor in heaven to be satisfied with anything i do unless the spirit of the lord jesus christ the spirit of revelation makes them satisfied suppose that the people were heedless that they manifested no concern with regard to the things of the kingdom of god but threw the whole burden upon the leaders of the people saying if the brethren who take charge of matters are satisfied we are this is not pleasing in the sight of the lord
1642528 jogar p la brincar de clube fingir de ex rcito arremedar elei es sentirem se importantes viver num mundo que fosse s deles
1642529 there is no end to the good we can do to the influence we can have with others let us not dwell on the critical or the negative let us pray for strength let us pray for capacity and desire to assist others let us radiate the light of the gospel at all times and all places that the spirit of the redeemer may radiate from us
1642530 me against my brother my brother and i against my uncle my brother my uncle and i against the world
1642531 youre just mad because she rejected you in pride amp prejudice
1642532 oh watching tv with dave more like making out with dave argh
1642533 by the 1980s the church had clear and convincing statistical evidence that scouting had no net positive effect on the long term success of lds youth using gospel markers such as temple marriage and missions or on their activity rates several efforts were made to look for replacements
1642534 in north carolina there werent enough mormons to make much of a difference in the general scouting activity of the region but in the mormon corridor my eagle scout would be an expectation not an achievement
1642535 what i had was a group of young boys not young men who had been trained to rely on others to carry them and to achieve by going through the motions while an adult worked a check list while there are bright spots with brilliant caring adults scouting is mostly a faux reality theme park experience rather than a training experience
1642536 is there something more we can do than simply blog about it
1642537 this may come as a shock but most boys today still love camping and backpacking and so forth
1642538 ive never heard of this clear and convincing statistiacal evidence do you have any resources where i could reasearch this this would be helpful in my position to know
1642539 i was stake executive secretary we had a visiting general authority with transparencies and lots and lots and lots of statistical data
1642540 dont worry it will all be published in a couple months
1642541 when i was at usaf survival school our instructor told one of the more inept students that he
1642542 ok made me laugh and cry at the same time
1642543 scouting is a great program in addition to ym that helps our boys become better men but yw is enough for the girls
1642544 doesnt shopping teach patience and endurance and how to manage money
1642545 wouldnt learning electrical skills teach the girls what they need to know in life
1642546 im not arguing against what scouting can be im talking sadly about what it is
1642547 ranger is not terribly germane to todays life for most i believe the skills have a relevance if approached in the right manner
1642548 are far more important than the content and implementation of the current young mens programs
1642549 i recall a sister in primary who totes around one of those gallon sized weight watcher mugs i assume its water but who knows
1642550 there elder ballard feeds his kids cheerios in church so maybe its not that bad a thing to do
1642551 the line of priesthood authority was broken but mankind was not left in total darkness or completely without revelation or inspiration the idea that with the crucifixion of christ the heavens were closed and that they opened in the first vision is not true the light of christ would be everywhere present to attend the children of god the holy ghost would visit seeking souls the prayers of the righteous would not go unanswered
1642552 all down the ages good and great men not bearing the priesthood but possessing profundity of thought great wisdom and a desire to uplift their fellows have been sent by the almighty into many nations to give them not the fulness of the gospel but that portion of truth that they were able to receive and wisely use
1642553 informed latter day saints do not argue that historic christianity lost
1642554 w e claim that gods inspiration is not limited to the latter day saints
1642555 all men share an inheritance of divine light god operates among his children in all nations and those who seek god are entitled to further light and knowledge regardless of their race nationality or cultural traditions
1642556 book of mormon vi myth as gods covenant people mormons are the people god has chosen to perform his great and marvelous work more than one people for the accomplishment of his great and marvelous work the latter day saints cannot do it all it is too vast too arduous for any one people we have no quarrel with the gentiles they are our partners in a certain sense
1642557 we believe that most religious leaders and followers are sincere believers who love god and understand and serve him to the best of their abilities we are indebted to the men and women who kept the light of faith and learning alive through the centuries to the present day we honor them as
1642558 the great religious leaders of the world such as mohammed confucius and the reformers as well as philosophers including socrates plato and others received a portion of gods light moral truths were given to them by god to enlighten whole nations and to bring a higher level of understanding to individuals we believe that god has given and will give to all peoples sufficient knowledge to help them on their way to eternal salvation
1642559 i ndividual orientation to the church of the lamb or to the great and abominable church is not by membership but by loyalty just as there latter day saints who belong to the great and abominable church because of their loyalty to satan and his life style so there are members of other churches who belong to the lamb because of their loyalty to him and his life style membership is based more on who has your heart than on who has your records
1642560 we must understand that not everyone is going to accept our doctrine of the restoration of the gospel of jesus christ for the most part our neighbors not of our faith are good honorable people every bit as good and honorable as we strive to be they care about their families just like we do they want to make the world a better place just like we do they are kind and loving and generous and faithful just like we seek to be
1642561 perhaps the lord needs men on the outside of his church to help it along they can do more good for the cause where the lord has placed them than anywhere else hence some are drawn into the fold and receive a testimony of the truth while others remain unconverted the beauties and glories of the gospel being veiled temporarily from their view for a wise purpose
1642562 the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth with which i the lord am well pleased
1642563 mormons think that name of church is in apostosy and all of its members are abominable whore of the earth who will go to hell
1642564 god is using more than one people for the accomplishment of his great and marvelous work the latter day saints cannot do it all it is too vast too arduous for any one people
1642565 personally i agree that atheists are more friends than enemies to the church perhaps to any church why i dont buy that i got my morals from religion
1642566 religion is only one of many venues where values and morals are learned and as we see from present and past not all things taught in the house of religion are good and just
1642567 but in the end according to our doctrine none of the other churches have the fullness of the gospel nor the priesthood so our church is still more true than your church in short according to mormons this is still the one true church
1642568 the leaders of all other churches are corrupt and that they draw near to him with their mouths but their hearts are far from him
1642569 at least some of our leaders have taught these myths as doctrine
1642570 the inquiry is frequently made of me wherein do you differ from others in your religious views in reality and essence we do not differ so far in our religious views but that we could all drink into one principle of love one of the grand fundamental principles of mormonism is to receive truth let it come from whence it may
1642571 the atheist refuses to accept that fact that were born with the light of christ and shuns god
1642572 i think most atheists do not actively refuse to accept anything or shun god they dont find enough evidence to believe that there is even a god to shun
1642573 js himself said that any one who wanted to call himself a mormon needed to acknowledge the good in other churches
1642574 personally i agree that atheists are more friends than enemies to the church perhaps to any church why i dont buy that i got my morals from religion
1642575 creeds set up stakes and bounds to the works of the almighty
1642576 a belief or set of beliefs often unproven or false that have accrued around a person phenomenon or institution
1642577 im sorry jeff spector but you seem rather ignorant of atheism
1642578 but my point was that they atheists cannot adequately explain where their morals are derived from
1642579 you mention all these hedonistic ideals that apparently are ascribed to all atheists
1642580 for someone to truly be atheistic then what is the point of life
1642581 again i just stated my opinion that for someone to truly be atheistic then what is the point of life
1642582 sadly this quote also reveals that we have regressed in the complexity and exactness of our language
1642583 we dont need you we are children of abraham we are fine
1642584 i must do everything i possibly can do i must give my all i must wear out myself trying to do what he has asked me to do then he will accept my effort and help me do more
1642585 as i review the pages of the book of my life i am grateful for what i read what i have experienced but i am most grateful for what has remained unwritten those things from which the grace of god has shielded me those things i have not had to experience those things from which i have been saved in this life
1642586 there is no indication in the record itself that this promise is intended to be fulfilled in the hereafter
1642587 dont wait until you get to the bottom of the hill to jump on the skateboard
1642588 christs work was done for us so that we do not need to do anything
1642589 our hope rests in him and him alone and anyone who thinks they can add it are deceiving themselves
1642590 there is no indication in the record itself that this promise is intended to be fulfilled solely in the hereafter
1642591 i believe the greatest challenge of all is learning how to live with a continual and overwhelming sense of gratitude when we are truly grateful and we remember all that we have been given we are instantly humbled and find peace with ourselves and the world
1642592 behold this is my doctrine whosoever repenteth and cometh unto me the same is my church whosoever declareth more or less than this the same is not of me but is against me therefore he is not of my church and now behold whosoever is of my church and endureth of my church to the end him will i establish upon my rock and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them
1642593 i have had it described as torment to see those who have made it while you may be stuck in the lesser heaven
1642594 isnt anyone given that first salvation who lives a good life whether or not they believe in jesus
1642595 the balance doesnt matter its that we give all we have to him
1642596 inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my breathren ye have done it unto me
1642597 but it is the works that follow that get you exalted saved without them you cannot achieve exaltation no matter how much you believe
1642598 no more work is necessary unlike what it is you believe
1642599 i know you put these together with the line saved by grace after all you can do but think about this when is it all you can do and when does faith come into it
1642600 you have to go do a bunch of works and then you can be saved
1642601 i would like a simple and straight forward response to what is it to be saved in mormonism
1642602 how does jesus atonement save you from difficulties or sins in your life right now
1642603 work because it brings them joy to come to know god so completely
1642604 is being saved the terror of the outer darkness or is it exaltation
1642605 salvation is permanent and it is a one time thing
1642606 i am sure you are aware of the concept of that which is most simple is usually the correct path
1642607 you also assume that i think if a person does not have a true change of heart that person may still be saved this is not my intent or my belief
1642608 i see the logic you present but the emphasis is on the works
1642609 you believe that nothing matters outside if you dont believe but it is the works that follow that get you exalted saved
1642610 in mormonism you cannot be exalted the ultimate salvation if you do not do these specific things
1642611 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden
1642612 why arent you sure anymore because you have cut all the communication lines you have lost his address you do not have his telephone number even and you do not have any address the communication lines have been severed how do you expect to know whether he is living or dead if you went for two years withoutever hearing from your parents and they were in the opposite end of the world how would you know if they were alive or dead how do you know whether god is alive or dead if you have lost communication now you get on your knees my boy if you want to be happy get on your knees and crawl on your knees to the city of happiness only there is peace
1642613 ill agree to stop the conversation but be careful not to define my beliefs for me either also be careful to avoid grouping all christians together you have on more than one occasion mentioned that other christians say this or that
1642614 i happen to know that many of your arminianist brethren
1642615 i mentioned how often ive seen the more fundamentalist evangelicals particularly the calvinistic ones
1642616 now i dont know if you believe like this or not personally but for those evangelicals whom i assume you would consider brothers in the gospel
1642617 i happen to know that a good many christians of many faiths also believe in the idea that our works affect our level of rewards in heaven
1642618 now i dont know if you believe like this or not personally
1642619 pointing out what group x believes in this debate and assuming i agree or stating like i am wrong about christianitys based on that is grouping me with them and putting words in my mouth
1642620 now i dont know if you believe like this or not personally but for those evangelicals whom i assume you would consider brothers in the gospel i think your statement above is inaccurate
1642621 i happen to know that many of your arminianist brethren disagree with you
1642622 salvation is permanent and it is a one time thing
1642623 which then begs the question what would foster an environment for someone to post something like that
1642624 i thought byu fans were bad utah fans are like byu fans but drunker
1642625 how about adding a cultural fact on a sports program when it is relavent or reiterating the honor code and respect of others in the byu newspaper prior to a game
1642626 the university of utah is not a church owned university
1642627 chris heimerdinger breaks mormon cinemas green jell o mold in passage to zarahemla ambitiously transposing settings from the book of mormon into a stimulating action adventure drama
1642628 great and terrible was the appearance of the armies of giddianhi because of their armor and because of their being dyed in blood
1642629 all who have died without a knowledge of this gospel who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry shall be heirs to the celestial kingdom of god also all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it who would have received it with all their hearts shall be heirs of that kingdom for i the lord will judge all men according to their works according to the desire of their hearts
1642630 but what about all the people who refuse to do proxy work holocaust jews for example or just the sheer numbers of persons who have lived without the priesthood
1642631 the problem i have personally is that it appears the answers to the problem are only found in folklore the church does not give an answer with conviction that brings the issue to rest you have to speculate in order to make sense of it
1642632 we dont have all the answers some folks are so uncomfortable with not knowing that they have to speculate in order to find peace one thing leads to another and it becomes accepted as possible truth
1642633 some doctrines are more important than others and might be considered core doctrines for example the precise location of the garden of eden is far less important than doctrine about jesus christ and his atoning sacrifice
1642634 we do indeed have to speculate to make sense of it all i think the only way in which i differ from you is that this doesnt seem to make me the slightest bit uncomfortable and you feel less comfortable with it
1642635 t he pathway from depression to harmful alcohol use and alcohol dependence has long been discussed under the heading of self medication i e the use of alcohol to alleviate depressive symptoms
1642636 not too hard to take the girl out of utah but tricky to take utah out of the girl im probably not as depressed as i would have been if id stayed but sufficient unto the day is the dysthymia thereof
1642637 i really cant see why utah would be more depressing than nebraska or west virginia or rural pa but thats just me
1642638 for from the days of cain there was a secret combination their works were in the dark
1642639 and it came to pass that there arose a rebellion among the people because of that secret combination which was built up to get power and gain
1642640 and how that it was his object to murder and also that it was the object of all those who belonged to his band to murder and to rob and to gain power and this was their
1642641 there was continual peace established in the land all save it were the
1642642 wherefore o ye gentiles it is wisdom in god that these things should be shown unto you that thereby ye may repent of your sins and suffer not that these murderous combinations shall get above you when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation because of this secret combination which shall be among you
1642643 and even now let him that goeth to the east teach them that shall be converted to flee to the west and this in consequence of that which is coming on the earth and of
1642644 some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the united states characterizing my family and me as internationalists and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure one world if you will if that is the charge i stand guilty and i am proud of it
1642645 wasnt there a youtube clip going around last year with mitt romney and some right wing radio host talking about how they were huge fans of the skousens
1642646 so youre saying glenn beck isnt fringe because he seems pretty crazy to me
1642647 when two or more are gathered in my name there is l no wait there is a conspiracy
1642648 what about those secret combinations that arise along the wasatch front like impact training
1642649 any time an author deems it necessary to list his professional title credentials as part of his name on the cover of a book i
1642650 any time an author deems it necessary to list his professional title credentials as part of his name on the cover of a book i
1642651 but what did he really just admit to furthering international banking even if it had short term negative effects to one country his own oooh im shakin he was being a visionary his admission is just pride at his own accomplishment stating in a way so as to give it the most impact possible and to shake people up
1642652 as for peters list of secret combinations i have to take issue with some organizations like academia
1642653 and why no mention of right wing militia groups or christian fundamentalists
1642654 how come none of these groups look like us theyre either rich bankers big oil godless commies or brown haiti voodoo skinwalkers etc
1642655 not a gadianton robber just a capitalist working for a global company that can see beyond my own countrys borders
1642656 capitalism is the telestial best we have but i wouldnt embrace it its clearly inferior to consecration
1642657 not a gadianton robber just a capitalist working for a global company that can see beyond my own countrys borders i say visionary because what he claimed he did was favor long term international objectives over short term national interests
1642658 hawkgrrl capitalism is the telestial best we have but i wouldnt embrace it its clearly inferior to consecration i dont mind capitalism invisible hand etc dont undermine our sovreignty to get it the constitution is more important to me than earning a fast buck
1642659 i dont consider that clear at all i have been told that by church leaders and i trust them but i would call it anything but clear since every time it has ever been practiced it has either been a total disaster or we were given insufficient information about why it was successful enoch
1642660 but my point had nothing to do with capitalism we are a capitalist nation and everything to do with the belief that its not high treason to put global interests ahead of short term us interests
1642661 will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the kingdom of god
1642662 we make no claim of infallibility or perfection in the prophets seers and revelators
1642663 i am not a perfect man and infallibility does not come with the call
1642664 some revelations are of god some revelations are of man and some revelations are of the devil
1642665 a single statement made by a single leader on a single occasion often represents a personal though well considered opinion but is not meant to be officially binding for the whole church
1642666 this guidance comes as thoughts as feelings through impressions and promptings
1642667 if i ask god to give me wisdom concerning any requirement in life or in regard to my own course or that of my friends my family my children or those that i preside over and get no answer from him and then do the very best that my judgment will teach me he is bound to own and honor that transaction and he will do so to all intents and purposes
1642668 our protection from erroneous doctrine lies in an overriding belief in continuing revelation to the current prophet
1642669 i witness humbly that i know the lord still guides his church through his servants regardless of any individual imperfections
1642670 i am more afraid that this people have so much confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of god whether they are led by him i am fearful they settle down in a state of blind self security trusting their eternal destiny in the hands of their leaders with a reckless confidence that in itself would thwart the purposes of god in their salvation and weaken that influence they could give to their leaders did they know for themselves by the revelations of jesus that they are led in the right way let every man and woman know by the whispering of the spirit of god to themselves whether their leaders are walking in the path the lord dictates or not
1642671 i am more afraid that this people have so much confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of god whether they are led by him
1642672 9 questioning and examining church leaders statements is not only allowed it is encouraged
1642673 im tempted to wonder why we as mormons are so vulnerable to unrealistic expectations of our church and its leaders
1642674 we as individuals should find god on our own which is our testimony and that church leaders only guide us to him
1642675 questioning and examining church leaders statements is not only allowed it is encouraged
1642676 i can assure you if anyone has any problem with smug complacency it isnt members of this church
1642677 its an illusion of honest investigation youre allowed to ask but you wont be correct
1642678 while we acknowledge the possibility and probability of errors existing within the church wisdom and humility should prevent each of us from concluding that our judgment and spiritual discernment is superior to that of our church leaders accordingly none of us should conclude we possess the superior judgment necessary to identify those errors that task has been assigned to our leaders
1642679 if thats your position that is fine but it does not mean that people who exercise deference to an authority in which they believe are somehow intellectually dishonest as explained if you accept the premise of the gas authority then their deference to that authority is entirely logical
1642680 if a member of the church claims the right to not sustain the current prophet of the church and to not reject the evidence for that decision and to seek for a d amp c 107 81 84 type trial to end the
1642681 father they do not know what they do forgive them
1642682 every good thing and recognize inspired leaders doing the same giving credit where it is due to the lord even for their own best thoughts moroni 7 24 is 2 11
1642683 the hopeful in christ look to him as the living source of every good thing and recognize inspired leaders doing the same giving credit where it is due to the lord even for their own best thoughts
1642684 its the utmost of arrogance that jehovahs witnesses and mormons think they are the only true church as a baptist i dont believe were the only true church
1642685 why is that section all fenced up with barb wire around it
1642686 oh thats where the catholics hang out and they dont think that the rest of us are here
1642687 so while baptists do not believe they are the only church i e denomination that has saved people they certainly believe their core belief system i e religion is the one true belief system
1642688 ours is the true church and yours is the fabrication
1642689 i dont think however being saved however has much to do with ones belief system rather depending on how arminian or calvinist one is it has everything to do with 1 making a decision for christ or 2 gods irresistible grace baptists themselves are split on this neither however requires a great deal of doctrinal orthodoxy
1642690 thus the standard line that mormons wont be saved because they dont believe in salvation by grace alone is actually reserved for mormons catholics sometimes and jws and not equally applied to all religions
1642691 i actually disagree with your last sentence if you accept its fundamental organizing principle that of the absolute sovereignty of god calvinism is extraordinarily internally consistent and at no point more than its soteriology
1642692 the average joe non phd southern baptist view amongst those southern baptists that believe in the calvinistic point of view as represented by 100 of those ive talked to in my limited experience
1642693 actually if we go by the disputes at the synod of dort the real difference between arminianism and calvinism is that arminius believed
1642694 im not particularly impressed with some of robinsons theology i think he hews too closely to the evangelical line i personally think that our soteriologys much closer to the catholics than any of the protestant traditions
1642695 i dont fully agree with this it strikes me that evangelical fear that mormons wont be saved is due more to the finney style arminian penetration into their theology its not that they believe that mormons are not offered grace but rather that mormonism does not offer its believers an appropriate forum for choosing to accept it this of course is not particularly calvinist at all
1642696 can you name another religion that does in fact believe as mormons do that one finds the truth about god via prayer and personal revelation
1642697 pretty much all of them contra to common mormon belief other traditions do not believe that god no longer trafficks in personal revelation
1642698 well thats how you can know the book of mormon is true
1642699 we seem to believe otherwise at least about baptism and possibly about the endowment but then again i dont know that there are any authoritative statements about this
1642700 i dont find protestant and catholic soteriology to be that similar at all honestly
1642701 i dont actually think mormons have a coherent theology of sacraments
1642702 can you name another religion that does in fact believe as mormons do that one finds the truth about god via prayer and personal revelation
1642703 for protestants in particular the bible is all the proof that is needed and any honest hearted person that studies the bible and looks into christian history will find full proof of christianitys truthfulness
1642704 were in the religion making business as you intimated earlier only for a short time i mean compared to the christian church which has been at this for a couple of millennia
1642705 his work is characterized as an artist whose work remains on the testy edge of art and ideas
1642706 god himself was once as we are now and is an exalted man and sits enthroned in yonder heavens
1642707 do we teach it the way the person doing the interview understood the concept
1642708 is the doctrine taught or emphasized in the church today
1642709 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne
1642710 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross
1642711 i personally have been much quoted and in a few instances misquoted and misunderstood i think thats to be expected none of you need worry because you read something that was incompletely reported you need not worry that i do not understand some matters of doctrine i think i understand them thoroughly and it is unfortunate that the reporting may not make this clear i hope you will never look to the public press as the authority on the doctrines of the church
1642712 what are the best ways to truthfully as possible answer difficult questions like this
1642713 as man is god once was as god is man may become
1642714 the mormon concept of exaltation is closely tied to the origin or our own god
1642715 yes we believe in eternal progression and that god himself went through a mortal experience similar to our own
1642716 hinckley should have boldly declared my favorite take on this matter
1642717 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne
1642718 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross
1642719 that gets into some pretty deep theology that we dont know very much about
1642720 the gospel is simple its black or white no gray it is or it is not
1642721 that gets into some pretty deep theology that we dont know very much about
1642722 i think maybe you honestly believe we must either accept every statement made as true or not true and that we all must agree on that point
1642723 im not saying you are thinking this but is it possible that you are thinking this
1642724 what joseph smith exactly meant is open for debate and is debated
1642725 that gets into some pretty deep theology that we dont know very much about
1642726 hope d you will never look to the public press as the authority on the doctrines of the church
1642727 that gets into some pretty deep theology that we dont know very much about
1642728 i think its much more effective than the advice to delete beliefs like the plan of salvation or even that the garden of eden was in missouri whats wrong with either of those beliefs nothing and only a small percentage of outsiders will even care if you have those beliefs if you take pride in them explain the idea behind them and are just generally open about them
1642729 taking pride in them explain the idea behind them and are just generally open about them
1642730 the doctrines of men having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof
1642731 i dont know much about this i dont know that its doctrine i dont know that we teach it i dont know that we emphasize it but i dont necessarily deny it
1642732 youve reinforced my impression that you are not open to listening on this thread
1642733 we are called to do whatever we can that will genuinely create peace even sacrifice our own lives
1642734 enemies cannot be defeated they can only be changed into other than enemies by true principles of love and god will provide the power to do that if we will trust him and pay the price of trying things his way
1642735 i have to keep my mouth shut in elders quorum
1642736 nobody in my ward is interested in hearing the truth about historical issue x
1642737 i have no doubt that many of these people now in their 30s and 40s would cite gene as the single most important person in their college education and in the process of their becoming adults within their own faith culture
1642738 right so you are a christian worshipping in a synagogue then right
1642739 if you were the leader of israel or palestine for a day what would you do to make peace
1642740 if only we had more compassion for those who are different from us it would certainly make our families and the church a more hallowed and heavenly place
1642741 many feel discouraged because they have not measured up to their potential
1642742 thus we see that the lord worketh in many ways to the salvation of his people
1642743 youve sacrificed enough lives to follow me i wont require that you sacrifice your sons
1642744 sometimes all we can hope for is for god to bring us home
1642745 sober conservative religious and married doesnt necessarily make them victims of abuse
1642746 you believe something so foreign to me that i dont understand why anyone could believe that thing unless they were under a spell by some wicked witch
1642747 is age 8 old enough to decide to get baptized
1642748 follow the prophet follow the prophet dont go astray follow the prophet follow the prophet follow the prophet he knows the way
1642749 training teaching can involve persuasion when the instructor helps the student see why a particular point of view is more correct than other points of view legitimate trainers and teachers do not attempt to condition their students into uncritically adopting a certain viewpoint or set of behaviors
1642750 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
1642751 oh my kind and affectionate emma i am yours forever
1642752 it will do no good for you to baptize someone and have that individual fall away from the church shortly thereafter what have you accomplished you may have labored long and hard you may have fasted and prayed as you taught a particular individual the gospel but if he does not remain active in the church all of your labor has been in vain the whole process counts for nothing any investigator worthy of baptism becomes a convert worthy of saving
1642753 would this person fully embrace the gospel and be an asset to the ward or just ultimately be a liability or burden
1642754 now it is important to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and hope that they will accept the message of the gospel feel the spirit and be converted
1642755 if there were no converts the church would shrivel and die on the vine
1642756 i have said before and i repeat it that every new convert needs three things
1642757 and as far as what heather martin said about issues with garments black and the priesthood etc there is no way missionaries are going to solve everyones ocncerns because you never know what concerns a person will have unless they tell you
1642758 do you really want to get baptized and join the church
1642759 as mormons we are constantly taught and reminded that obedience brings happiness
1642760 one of lifes great lessons is to learn that happiness comes through obedience
1642761 keeping the covenants is not hard when you do it willingly with a
1642762 as we keep his commandments we are blessed and come to know true happiness true happiness comes from keeping the commandments of god
1642763 in this life the obedient may enjoy peace of mind happiness and
1642764 obedience will yield happiness while violation of his commandments will not
1642765 this life is an experience in profound trust trust in jesus christ trust in his teachings trust in our capacity as led by the holy spirit to obey those teachings for happiness now and for a purposeful supremely happy eternal existence
1642766 to be happy and successful we must obey the laws and regulations pertaining to our activities
1642767 there is great joy and happiness in striving to live righteously no other feeling in the soul of man can bring the joy and happiness than that of knowing you are doing all you can to become righteous
1642768 if i try to be obedient and am not happy as i have expected to be based on the scriptures and words of the prophets my obedience must be wickedness
1642769 but behold this my joy was vain for their sorrowing was not unto repentance because of the goodness of god but it was rather the sorrowing of the damned because the lord would not always suffer them to take happiness in sin
1642770 happiness is the purpose of our existence love is the source of happiness obedience means loving god and loving our neighbor
1642771 the individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe if you try it you will be lonely often and sometimes frightened but no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself
1642772 be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect
1642773 im only as good as my most recent behaviour i did a good thing so i am a good thing i did a bad thing so i am a bad thing
1642774 he who drinks of the living water i shall give him shall never thirst again
1642775 we can be miserable right now but its okay because it will make us be happy in some future state of existence that we hope exists
1642776 when they live it gets touted as divine protection for their obedience when they die theyre basically counted as martyrs who would rather die than be disobedient
1642777 you say our relationship with god should not be sought as a means of finding benefits like
1642778 also i have a hard time understanding why god would use promises of fulfillment enjoyment comfort etc
1642779 he who drinks of the living water i shall give him shall never thirst again
1642780 nothing wrong with the idea of seeking happiness through loving god and others
1642781 the reason i think youre both wrong is that imo happiness is not the outcome of anything its a state of mind
1642782 for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind
1642783 they say there are only two basic emotions fear and love and all other emotions are varying degrees and combinations of those two
1642784 if there be two spirits and one shall be more intelligent than the other yet these two spirits notwithstanding one is more intelligent than the other have no beginning they existed before they shall have no end they shall exist after for they are gnolaum or eternal
1642785 man was also in the beginning with god intelligence or the light of truth was not created or made neither indeed can be
1642786 you are operating from a set of assumptions that are different than the assumptions im working with
1642787 true enduring happiness with the accompanying strength courage and capacity to overcome the greatest difficulties will come as you center your life in jesus christ obedience to his teachings provides a secure ascent in the journey of life that takes effort while there is no guarantee of overnight results there is the assurance that in the lords time solutions will come peace will prevail and happiness will be yours
1642788 darryl chase who was later president of the university in the campus pastors of which he was one and the student organizations were going to have a meeting to deal with the problem of what should be done about housing for the migrant workers in arizona now this is way back in the 30s the migrant workers were living in shacks many of them made of cardboard i saw them it was a terrible condition now this student organization was going to have a meeting to discuss what should be done and they were arranging for the program and they asked darryl chase its a marvelous thing what the church does theres no need of my commenting on it because its perfectly obvious to all of us
1642789 do you think we still have that sense of family today or do we tend to see
1642790 its strange when i compare my personal beliefs and faith against mormon beliefs faith im always pleasantely surprised to discover that were not that far apart so much so that i start to feel like i really might be a
1642791 if i have one question after all of this it is is there a doctrine or two which underpins the cultural vitality ive witnessed or is it a sense of shared history the pioneers and all that
1642792 the church of jesus christ of latter day saints is the only true and living church on the earth today
1642793 but i was referring to the others who are not in that category who campaign for the church to make radical changes in doctrine
1642794 when heavenly father decides it should happen it will happen
1642795 when heavenly father decides it should happen it will happen
1642796 you are right if i was a women or a homosexual who was not willing to accept what has been taught from the beginning of the church i would not think it a pet issue it would be my cause for sure
1642797 ask why they are attacking the perceived subjective tone and not their actual arguments
1642798 why should i bother to respond to such a person
1642799 wow theres someone who is hurt and or feels very passionately about something i wonder why he feels that way
1642800 what do you mean become a priest i already am one
1642801 for someone who believes in the exclusive authority of the leaders of the church it is worse than death to be punished by them
1642802 i am not alone in my mindset there are many people that probably agree more with my way of thinking than yours
1642803 do you feel that men are more capable and better suited to handle priesthood leadership responsibilities than women are
1642804 do you feel that women are more suited for homemaking and cleaning and childrearing than men are
1642805 do you feel that women who dont wish to be mothers are sinners
1642806 do you feel that boys are better suited for missionary work than girls are
1642807 do you think it was wrong of faithful lds members to question the priesthood ban for blacks in 1970 because at that time the priesthood was not given to blacks on this earth
1642808 do you feel its ok to expect gay members of the church to remain celibate their entire lives and to treat those who engage in sex as unworthy sinners
1642809 you are not alone in your mindset the nazis were not alone in their mindset that jews should be exterminated
1642810 the kkk was not alone in its mindset that blacks should be killed because whites are better
1642811 the plantation owners of the south were not alone in their mindset that people with black skin were born to be slaves
1642812 the countless chinese mothers who bound the feet of their daughters were not alone in believing that crippling their daughters was appealing and attractive
1642813 if the church decided to follow coreys or erics suggestion and be up front about its history to apologize for past mistakes to let gay people in etc if the church were to become what the critics want it to become it would implode
1642814 gay people who take hinckleys words at face value will find themselves in a very difficult position
1642815 any daughter of mine who comes home pregnant out of wedlock is no longer my daughter
1642816 oh but i thought you said your son was 11 oh that means ooooh
1642817 but why not he loves me and i love him
1642818 but where will we go when we die who will i be with
1642819 all i could think about was my high priest dads words from my childhood
1642820 that the temple as a social control mechanism exists because joseph smith needed to hide his sordid little affairs
1642821 stop while you are ahead suggesting there is a problem with her spouse or her or their marriage with only the information shared on here is way outta line
1642822 if she wants to do that and is worthy thats fine with me
1642823 regardless of if it is now or always has been required of both non member wives and husbands which i do believe has only changed recently
1642824 there are some things that are true that arent very useful
1642825 told of counsel he had received from one of his professors who was an imminent historian you dont write and i might add you dont teach history out of garbage pails
1642826 the accommodation history advocated by elders benson and packer and actually practised by some lds writers is intended to protect the saints but actually disillusions them and makes them vulnerable the tragic reality is that there have been occasions when church leaders teachers and writers have not told the truth they knew about difficulties of the mormon past but have offered to the saints instead a mixture of platitudes half truths omissions and plausible denials a so called
1642827 hunter counseled me to keep in mind that church members reverenced leaders and their policies to investigate too closely the private lives of leaders and the circumstances that led to their decisions might remove some of the aura that sanctified church policies and procedures if the daylight of historical research should shine too brightly upon prophets and their policies he cautioned it might devitalize the charisma that dedicated leadership inspires i accepted hunters counsel as a mandate for free and honest scholarly pursuit with a warning that we must be discreet
1642828 i dont want you to find out the whole truth so ill give you just enough to significantly increase the probability that you wont be tempted to want to find out the whole truth
1642829 a worthy member who is married to an unendowed spouse whether the spouse is a member or nonmember may receive a recommend when 1 the bishop receives the written consent of the spouse and 2 the bishop and stake president are satisfied that the responsibility assumed with the endowment will not impair marital harmony
1642830 nevertheless i think that the editors of the by manual felt that the lessons that by taught the saints transended polygamy and were valuable for us to learn and discuss after all the manual was a doctrinal manual not a history manual
1642831 information and lessons necessary for our salvation and for no other purpose
1642832 id also be interested in a list of things which people found out about the church that was shocking to them and cause them to re evaluate their testimony
1642833 to provide the information and lessons necessary for our salvation and for no other purpose
1642834 i have already said i thought the manual was not good so i don t know why were are still arguing about that
1642835 i was referring facetiously to aarons comments 13 and 29 supra when i
1642836 if you go to the beehive or lion house in slc they mention it
1642837 id rather knaw off my own arm than disuss the titles thing again
1642838 the comments i made to point out the importance of showing respect to one another were just used in a way that seemed sarcastic and disrespectful
1642839 i suspect that the church teaches what is beleived to be necssary for salvation not a doctorate in church history
1642840 samuel johnson 1709 1784 once made the following astute observation
1642841 when someone opposes me he arouses my attention not my anger i go to meet a man who contradicts me the cause of truth should be the common cause for both
1642842 the end of argument or discussion should be not victory but enlightenment
1642843 he who knows only his own side of the case knows little
1642844 corey used an undiplomatic word in referring to a pamphlet which he feels was poorly conceived and promulgates error and prejudice i think weve established that the word displeased some folks and that corey regrets the sideshow the word caused but doesnt apologize for his feelings
1642845 it is not worth it to me to go along with the crap that he says and that he put out in his pamphlet a few days ago to to bishops so that i can take my kids back and show them where i got married
1642846 it is better to choose as friends those who do not publicly display their homosexual feelings
1642847 we will get farther if we debate the issues on the merits of logic and evidence
1642848 jayspec you are taking refuge in generalities instead of confronting your opponents about their specific errors you are blaming them for being irrational or manipulative
1642849 if you do not believe that someones statement is correct then call them on it may be your antagonist is wrong or inaccurate may be you will be surprised what you can learn
1642850 shouldnt feel that way based on the situation but in the end feelings are well feelings i am eager to learn all i can
1642851 i have the impression that you do not fully appreciate the realities of social life in the mormon experience as a german i can sympathize with that having friends and family members that have survived two totalitarian dictatorships i have learned that everyday experience is not necessarily characterized by the ultimate essence of the institutions
1642852 i learned a long time ago that someones opinions and feeling cant be wrong
1642853 shouldnt feel that way based on the situation but in the end feelings are well feelings i am eager to learn all i can
1642854 people have been presenting a lot more than their feelings jayspec thats a cop out
1642855 find it curious jayspec that you would compare teasing to the issues that people have brought to your attention
1642856 how much you have been infected by the authoritarian mindset perpetuated by mormon theology
1642857 you should all be proud of your little squabble excuse me while i call the whhhhaaaaaaaaahhhhh bulance
1642858 the bottom line is that the church lies to its members generally lies of ommission
1642859 do you believe in a god that would require us to lie to our spouses
1642860 joseph smith had a vision we need to talk about the other versions of his vision so that people can contextualize what happened and build a testimony on what happened
1642861 if were going to teach a history of the book of abraham we need to talk about where the research has lead and problems with the text because its wrong
1642862 well it wasnt meant to be evidence or a rational explanation only a spiritual text
1642863 we dont have to tell you the whole truth because that is available out there anyway
1642864 yes im critical of the church when it carefully edits parts of its history that to me are relevant to know i find it disgraceful that lesson manuals only mention joseph smiths and brigham youngs first wives and says absolutely nothing about the numerous other wives they had
1642865 sitting there in all those lessons knowing that it was likely that the only way id ever reach celestial exaltation was to become the second or third or hundredth wife of some guy like those women were to those men in the church made it relevant to me to know more about them
1642866 if i had known about joseph smiths secretive ways of keeping his visits from his plural wives from emma i may not have internally beat myself up so hard over my own sin of getting pregnant at byu
1642867 if i hadnt had countless lessons in church and in conference about being honest and having integrity and being forthright in all my dealings perhaps id have been a bit more forgiving or understanding when i discovered that in many ways the church leadership has not been forthright with the members by changing editing and omitting relevant details to promote greater faith in me and you
1642868 i would advise them all to avoid that person or any institution that embraced the same logic
1642869 i have known too many single parents that did not choose their situation and have endured those same lessons your lack of sympathy and understanding is not so fun to me your inability to show any understanding to others
1642870 by the way i dont want my sons to be like you either
1642871 but for now it isnt safe or good if people like you respond to people like sml as you just did
1642872 that is where you are wrong your perception of me is just that your perception it may not have any resemblance to who i am it is only how you project your bias on me it says a lot more about you than it does about me
1642873 im rubber youre glue whatever you say bounces off me and sticks on you
1642874 if it proves our pre determined conclusion great if not its useless
1642875 and while youre right that scientific thought can change im hard pressed to imagine what time bomb piece of evidence would alter the conclusions that the papyrus joseph smith translated that we know as the boa is really a funeral text for a guy named hor
1642876 thank you for not projecting your bias on me when you speculate on my
1642877 what you are saying is if sml was not a sinner she wouldnt feel as she does and sure others feel bad too but you sympathize with them because they didnt choose to be single parents and more the best way to be happy is the stereotypical mormon plan so its ok if a few people feel rotten along the way its so beyond me i feel icky just typing it
1642878 since we all know the people of the church including the leaders are imperfect
1642879 so that when the prophet the apostles the bishops yea even all the authorities in the church teach the youth to shun
1642880 so if the church is preaching things we think are uninspired even toxic in the current culture it makes sense to remove our kids from that influence
1642881 but please do not condemn or denegrate those who disagree with you and chose to stay
1642882 i think the real problem here is the church will not bow down to the doctrine that you espouse that is why you left
1642883 but if it leads them out then leave it alone
1642884 i blame nbc executives for example not the church for the cancellation of the west wing
1642885 so we can all be a bit critical at times but you folks cross the line in my opinion and then you are not even willing to work to fix it you just leave i hink thats not right
1642886 i think that by coming here and discussing these important issues i am doing my part to try to help fix the problems that i see within the church
1642887 there is no established way of getting my thoughts to the quorum of the twelve or the first presidency the only ones able to change the things that i see are vital to change if the church is to survive and not alienate even more of its members
1642888 i want my children to not dismiss or judge my gay brother as a vile sinner
1642889 i want my daughter to be spared the soul deep confusion and self worth questioning that will occur when she starts to notice that her brother gets responsibilities like collecting fast offerings locking the church passing the sacrament wielding the power to act in gods name and furthering the lords greatest work on earth while she is taught over and over that the most important thing she can do and should do is be a mother and a good homemaker for her husband who presides over her with his priesthood power
1642890 i have already found a way to make my life more authentic and moral for myself and my family i hope the church is someday a place where others can find that too
1642891 and if a person dares to express a different perspective than you about the church
1642892 and i suspect that most members think just the opposite
1642893 would you embrace it as willingly if you heard those types of words your entire life i dont seek to do a complete 180 with how this is i only seek to add equality which is sadly lacking of course i am talking to deaf ears because you feel this is gods plan for your happiness i only ask that you understand when i say that some of us dont find it so very happy to be involved in that kind of arrangement
1642894 i just think that not many are going to take the criticisms seriously when coming from someone who is not an active part of the church
1642895 it is wrong to criticize the leaders of the church even if the criticism is true
1642896 well that is not new its available at deseret book and todd compton remains an active member
1642897 about raising a family unto the lord about helping your children live up to their divine potiential about having an eternal perspective on life on become the best person you can on having a happy marriage
1642898 it is wrong to criticize the leaders of the church even if the criticism is true
1642899 i am really glad you brought all these points up truly i think they are very important and they are becoming more important each day if you are reading the comments here
1642900 first the many that you are referring to the active mormons are conditioned as youth and through repeated instructions from their leaders that they are not to criticize the church
1642901 it is wrong to criticize the leaders of the church even if the criticism is true
1642902 also criticisms inspections or observations are only valid based on the final conclusion or publicly declared testimony of the witness if i were to say the ces policy that discriminates against single or divorced instructors is wrong you would turn an ear from me as would many others however if steve evans says the same thing it is ok even though he is violating rule number one and not obeying oaks
1642903 i can find a whole bunch of people that have left the church after reading rough stone rolling but bushman is ok because he goes to church
1642904 well that is not new its available at deseret book and todd compton remains an active member
1642905 i dont suspect you understand my point jayspec the simple point is your statement is as bland and meaningless as saying mormons prefer to listen to the right people
1642906 you gotta give me a little more credit than that
1642907 if something is true and it sounds like anti mormon material then there is something wrong with the audience and mormonism not the source
1642908 the church is about salvation for you and it very well may fit the bill for doing all those other things you have said
1642909 about raising a family unto the lord about helping your children live up to their divine potential about having an eternal perspective on life on become the best person you can on having a happy marriage
1642910 you can say all that but you damn sure cannot say
1642911 hah you said it you said raise doubt you said it not those people that should be ignored if learning the truth raises doubt then so be it if discussing our world raises doubt so be it i dont think shying from reality and facts and truth is a good strategy even if doubt is a byproduct
1642912 certainly the way the church affects people is different for everyone i realize you want to position everything in the church as having a potential negative side to it but that is not the intention of the church to make people feel bad or have negative experiences life itself provides those opportunities all by itself you also seem to discount the role that choice plays in our life experiences both in and out of the church i guess i personally would not be part of an organization that i dont agree with or choose not to follow its teachings thats why i could never be a republican for example if it doesnt work for you it doesnt but to over generalize that it cant work for anyone the way it is is simply not correct
1642913 and you are exactly wrong that i want to position everything in the church as having a potential negative side to it
1642914 can you see that what we agree on is very valuable and your view of me and my opinions is counter to your first point
1642915 when it is acceptable to admit that it doesnt work for everyone families and marriages will be stronger and relationships will be improved
1642916 i have no intention of making the church appear bad in all that they do
1642917 when the choice to leave or change ones commitment to the church is based on newfound historical facts it feels civil and fair to me to have sympathy on that person and do all we can to minimize the negative consequences in their relationships
1642918 i dont discount choice at all i love it i want everyone to have choices i especially hope that people can choose what is best for themselves and their family without having to balance excessive external pressures from an institution that has different priorities than each individual
1642919 1 3 of fathers children were lost even before coming to earth
1642920 if you are a member and say that joseph smith was a fraud ull most likely be excommunicated wether its in sacrament a class or a blog or to others in private you just cant hold that view and continue to be a member
1642921 and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born
1642922 it is clear to me that the church has a much higher purpose than a political party or a social club it is governed by principles that are much higher as well but i really dont hear you addressing those higher principles
1642923 not being in the right place spiritually when s he made the decision to marry a non member
1642924 one of the highest principles the church maintains is one that i have addressed the principle that men preside over women and that women should only ever aspire to motherhood men get to enjoy fatherhood as well as aspire to leadership roles righteous priesthood authority
1642925 one of the highest principles the church maintains is one that i have addressed the principle that men preside over women and that women should only ever aspire to motherhood men get to enjoy fatherhood as well as aspire to leadership roles righteous priesthood authority the right to wield the power to act in gods name the ability to create worlds in the next life the power to be judges over their own worlds too
1642926 the church has set up standards and principles to follow that are very narrow
1642927 as for homosexuality that behavior hurts just as much as heterosexuality does meaning it hurts nobody heterosexual marriage will not be hurt by two gay people marrying the church will not suffer if it is accepting of people finding love and commitment with one another
1642928 a member marrying a non member should not be judged as
1642929 by divine design fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children
1642930 the rs pres primary pres and yw pres all have to get approval for anything they choose to do implement plan or teach by the priesthood leaders who really preside over these organizations
1642931 as for homosexuality that behavior hurts just as much as heterosexuality does
1642932 i was a true testimony bearing temple going scripture reading beleiver until i found out about
1642933 what purpose is it to reveal that joseph smith had multiple secret plural wives does it re enforce a core belief of the church i dont think so not in the same way as talking about the martin handcart company and rescue does
1642934 the book of mormon is a literal history joseph smith was inspired by god to translate it and gordon b hinckley is gods only true representative on earth today
1642935 i dont deny my spiritual experiences but have sought to understand them in light of all the data that weighs against the interpretation of those experiences that the church would impose on me
1642936 the biggest hurdle i could not overcome was processing how big my consequences were for a single solitary sexual sin and then finding out that the prophet joseph smith revered by me and the church was actually promiscuous where i was not and could lie when asked if he had plural wives yet i had to repent honestly and openly and faced consequences as if i were promiscuous
1642937 i feel bad that you do not look upon you repentance process as something you did for yourself and look upon it with regret due to someone elses actions 170 years ago
1642938 most of the folks i have known who have been disaffected tended to be fringe people at best
1642939 but having said that i must be different because i do not let the history or other people derail me from my spiritual journey because to me that is what it is all about
1642940 everyone is entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts
1642941 i look with regret upon the narrow teachings that one must seek to be perfect like the prophet joseph supposedly was and the very real and subtle message that to err means that you are fallen lacking less of a worthy person
1642942 all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
1642943 i never told you i was perfect but there is no error in the revelations which i have taught
1642944 it may surprise you to hear that i consider myself on the most spiritual journey ive ever been on this far surpasses the spirituality i felt while in church
1642945 while you have a point i think the historical dilema you cite is overused in the mormon context kind of an excuse to keep doing what weve always done
1642946 the lessons at church have a severe time limitation and so much detail is left out for the main points of the lesson
1642947 i think that is too simplistic a conclusion given the fact that many of those mormon scholars continue to be beleiving latter day saints
1642948 the fact is we teach only what will further the cause
1642949 an apologist historian many times has made up his her mind and is searching for anything to bolster their position
1642950 besides many including bushman are pushing for a more open approach to history because they have seen the problem the lack of openness can cause
1642951 generally speaking the details im arguing relate to the restoration and have some doctrinal theological impact
1642952 a persons faith that things happen a certain way is no less valid than anothers
1642953 again in my experience they didnt just quietly leave with the notion that they just didnt want to belong anymore there had to be something
1642954 how about the abysmal retention rate of returned missionaries were they fringe members
1642955 i dont mean to offend you or criticize but honestly im having some difficulty believing what you write here a stake president who doesnt believe in a key part of the bom plus what you wrote before on non believers with callings i dont know maybe its just me but no sorry i just dont believe everything you have written here
1642956 oh but of course the church isnt wrong those evil people just made something up and said it was wrong so they could commit adultery or watch football jayspec that is just goofy
1642957 now people will frequently ask us but why do you go to christians who already have a church who already have a belief
1642958 we dont consider any other church to have the legitimate authority of god and so our missionary work must go to all people
1642959 why do you preach to other christians instead of just going to the heathen
1642960 because christ has sent new messengers to prepare the way for his second coming just as john the baptist was sent to prepare the way for his first
1642961 bridging the divide the continuing conversation between a mormon and an evangelical
1642962 if were going to disagree however lets disagree on the right stuff on matters that we actually believe and teach today not just something that was said years ago but is not really a part of the doctrine of the church
1642963 a different jesus the christ of the latter day saints
1642964 we were going to a church but werent really satisfied with what we were hearing over the pulpit the pastor etc so when the missionaries knocked on our door
1642965 you should follow christ to follow christ you need to abide the path he taught part of that path is ordinances ordinances require authority to administer authority was lost we have authority restored
1642966 i like president hinckleys paraphrase we invite people to bring the good they have and make it better its an invitation to move into a bigger better house without burning down the old one
1642967 we just want to help people get saved through jesus christ just like you
1642968 and what is really necessary to be saved the ordinances repentence belief in the christ this is what we should focus on
1642969 but i ask you is it completely honest or is it misleading is dr millet telling the whole truth here or only a partial truth
1642970 i believe that an objective person would find it pretty clear obvious that the intent of the crafted statement is to disarm those who might otherwise feel threatened and that in doing so we are not to telling the complete truth
1642971 dear pastor we are trying to recruit every person out of your church that we can
1642972 our ultimate goal is to bring people to christ by taking them out of any church they might be attending and to bring them into our church
1642973 on one occasion i discussed some of these early teachings dealing with temple ordinances with another active lds member and within days found myself sitting in the bishops office where i was threatened with removal of my temple recommend
1642974 if the past history of the lds church is any indicator people like john who actually believe the more distinctive doctrines of mormonism will find themselves ostracized and their membership in the modern lds church jeapordized
1642975 the simple fact is that during the last two decades the lds church has sought to deemphasize and even discard as
1642976 i personally believe we need to focus our missionary work on deep conversion to christ and belief in his power to save while the institutional church prefers to stress the necessity of other christians accepting our authority to perform essential saving ordinances by the power of the restored new testament priesthood the catholics do this as well so you see were as mainstream as they are
1642977 i would say it was rogue regardless it was wrong period
1642978 if something is bad and it has to be abandoned regardless of who it comes from it might as well be rogue
1642979 stephen my point is this this feels like deceptive language for me like were crafting our words to make outsiders evangelicals think that our intentions are very different than what they really are
1642980 22 now ammon being wise yet harmless he said unto lamoni wilt thou hearken unto my words if i tell thee by what power i do these things and this is the thing that i desire of thee 23 and the king answered him and said yea i will believe all thy words and thus he was caught with guile
1642981 i disagree that we want all people to join our church
1642982 i see other christian churches as able to deliver the heaven they actually preach to their congregations the idea that there is even more heaven available to mormons than to other christians sounds pompous and insensitive and for most mormons diminishes the other kingdoms they may inherit also there is nothing scriptural that prohibits progression between kingdoms another time mcconkie went beyond what has been revealed
1642983 what if were elder monson who created the program last year moyle held the identical position in the church
1642984 in my experience that is dangerous for the dissembler the inquirer and ultimately the institution
1642985 of course we are because bottom line people who are not in the gospel do not know what is good for them or what they would want if they had more light yes i know that sounds bad but it is true they dont know what is good for them we do so we have to do what it takes to reel them in you may think that is deceptive i would say it is wisdom i would say that it is having peoples best interests in our hearts there is precedent for this
1642986 sometimes the truth reveals itself through being manifested by the results of mistakes showing themselves for what they are and then the truth of the matter is clear and therefore the truth is revealed on the matter
1642987 well if yall were wrong about all that what are you wrong about now
1642988 man if i was from another faith and saw this statement i would know fro sure that you were of the devil this sounds like typical political deception tell me what i want to hear lure me in fetter me to the wall leading them gently down to hell sorry but this does sound like a conniving plan to get converts
1642989 from what i understand of this it sounds like revelation is
1642990 the challenge with that approach having our leaders start to peel away all that is not scriptural is that it fundamentally challenges and often undermines our level of confidence in lds church leaders
1642991 i would love to see the day where in general conference we hear things like the only problem is the more they do this the weaker their mantle becomes
1642992 the only problem with your statement is that they end up in heaven not hell if they get baptized and endure and if i were of the devil my intention would not be to save them but to damn them telling part of the truth not all is not deception it is telling part of the truth telling a falsehood is a lie using wisdom isnt conniving using carefully crafted statements to bring the desired result isnt being of the devil
1642993 joseph just thought up all this stuff its being fine tuned but it may end up like the incandescent light bulb and the phonograph scrapped for the newest and latest revelation
1642994 you or i may get to the afterlife and say
1642995 if i was from another denomination and read what you have written then it appears to be ommission of fact to gain an end and to me and many that is deceptive
1642996 one method that some lds leaders have used to deemphasize the distinctive doctrines of mormonism is to classify anything you dont learn in primary as
1642997 let the brethren do what the brethren will do leave the matters of the leadership to the brethren
1642998 one method that some lds leaders have used to deemphasize the distinctive doctrines of mormonism is to classify anything you dont learn in primary as
1642999 im actually having a hard knowing if youre for real dude
1643000 either way it means they can wield incredible power in peoples lives without real inspiration
1643001 i was simply stating that i wasnt sure if you were baiting the issue or if you legitimately believe what you are writing
1643002 my understanding of the concept of the mantle is that it should protect the church from high ranking leaders human failings from crossing certain extreme lines
1643003 if the mantle was supposed to act as a shield from extremes in fallibility then brigham young should have been corrected on adam god and i absolutely disbelieve in that doctrine and reject it as absolutely incorrect yet i absolutely know brigham young had the mantle and i know that he shined when the mantle manifested itself in him to pull of miracles
1643004 this position just doesnt make sense to me it seems like you are just choosing to acknowledge a mantle when it works in favor of your view but dismiss it when it fails
1643005 its my opinion that there is no mantle and that where our conversation has gone is the natural conclusion when you really think about what it means to say leaders a fallible
1643006 of all treasures of knowledge the most vital is the knowledge of god his existence powers love and promises
1643007 if we spend our mortal days in accumulating secular knowledge to the exclusion of the spiritual then we are in a dead end street for this is the time for man to prepare to meet god this is the time for faith to be built
1643008 secular knowledge important as it may be can never save a soul nor open the celestial kingdom
1643009 in response to a skeptics questions about the resurrection the prophet alma gave this great insight into the mysteries of god
1643010 and therefore he that will harden his heart the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word and he that will not harden his heart to him is given the greater portion of the word until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of god until he know them in full
1643011 and they that will harden their hearts to them is given the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries and then they are taken captive by the devil and led by his will down to destruction now this is what is meant by the chains of hell
1643012 our spiritual power line is strengthened through prayer as we counsel with god in all our doings he will direct us for good see alma 37 37 prayer is available whenever we ask for it
1643013 if thou shalt ask thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation knowledge upon knowledge that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things that which bringeth joy that which bringeth life eternal
1643014 during those days of unconsciousness i was given by the gift and power of the holy ghost a more perfect knowledge of his mission
1643015 i currently see no way your beliefs could actually form into a coherent whole this may just be because you havent yet expressed all your beliefs its another thing all together to form your own coherent belief system that doesnt have its own holes
1643016 delivered unto the buffetings of satan unto the day of redemption
1643017 the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth
1643018 conceived by the holy ghost born of the virgin mary
1643019 will your missionaries preach only to unbelievers or will they also try to preach to believers
1643020 when you stand before a congregation and look into the faces of the people can you tell the difference between those who are real believers and those who are not
1643021 have you been honest in your dealings with your fellow men
1643022 have you been honest in your dealings with your fellow men except in those cases were you told a half truth in order to be less offending or to get them interested in the church
1643023 the point is ive heard countless times from bishops stake presidents and general authorities that members of the church should avoid
1643024 there may be some among you who are not sufficiently skilld in masonry to keep a secret let this epistle be had as a private matter in your society and we shall learn whether you are good masons
1643025 another strength satan can exploit is a strong desire to understand everything about every principle of the gospel how could that possibly work to our detriment experience teaches that if this desire is not disciplined it can cause some to pursue their searchings beyond the fringes of orthodoxy seeking answers to obscure mysteries rather than seeking a firmer understanding and a better practice of the basic principles of the gospel some seek answers to questions god has not chosen to answer others receive answers or think they receive answers in ways that are contrary to the order of the church for such searchers satan stands ready to mislead through sophistry or spurious revelation persons who hunger after a full understanding of all things must discipline their questions and their methods or they can approach apostasy without even knowing it it may be just as dangerous to exceed orthodoxy as it is to fall short of it the safety and happiness we are promised lie in keeping the commandments not in discounting or multiplying them
1643026 is it lying to children when we teach them about sex and relationships in a particular order
1643027 mormons arent christian according to my refined private definition of christian
1643028 i wont tell then about the wreck this car was in 1 year ago theyll find that out after they take it home to try it out for a night by then they will be sold on the car and then the small fact that the car was in an accident wont matter
1643029 is it lying to children when we teach them about sex and relationships in a particular order
1643030 but millet is not working towards a full answer here there isnt a plan to follow up later with clarification this answer looks bad and will harm the church as it is currently stated
1643031 so dude what do you think of what i am saying
1643032 i personally do not belive that is how christ operates
1643033 i can understand why people think it says but it just doesnt say that
1643034 that sounds good but we just dont know for sure
1643035 our best attempt to make out the details within the general outline we have been given
1643036 make logical decisions in virtually every other aspect of your lives except this one involving god
1643037 lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life
1643038 the best way of finding truth is simply to go to the origin of all truth and ask or respond to inspiration
1643039 remember that there are mountains of data facts and details that could be used to both prove and to disprove the existence of god
1643040 i can just say that we can all find help from the lord if were willing to pay the price required
1643041 the lord respects our agency and will not come unless invited we invite him with our faith
1643042 i will withhold belief in many things until there is ample verifiable evidence to support it
1643043 as long as that with holding doesnt keep you from producing the fruits of love and
1643044 in this dilemma he went back of the depot where he could not be observed and prayed asking that he be shown what to do
1643045 on a mission to complete the canal and establish homes
1643046 one afternoon as president sessions discussed the matter with the men working there
1643047 well why did the lord intervene then and not at another time for someone else like me when i prayed for a miracle
1643048 the argument from interpretive framework inherent in all human experience
1643049 when i was a byu student i spake as a byu student i understood as a byu student or in other words i didnt understand a word of paul i thought as a byu student but when i became a man i put away byu student ish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known and now abideth faith bhope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity
1643050 this september marks the 150th anniversary of a terrible episode in the history of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints on september 11 1857 some 50 to 60 local militiamen in southern utah aided by american indian allies massacred about 120 emigrants who were traveling by wagon to california the horrific crime which spared only 17 children age six and under occurred in a highland valley called the mountain meadows roughly 35 miles southwest of cedar city the victims most of them from arkansas were on their way to california with dreams of a bright future
1643051 wait and not kill anyone until they have been warned
1643052 in regard to emigration trains passing through our settlements we must not interfere with them untill they are first notified to keep away you must not meddle with them the indians we expect will do as they please but you should try and preserve good feelings with them there are no other trains going south that i know of i f those who are there will leave let them go in peace
1643053 the letter were discussing is a response when the ceder city group sent someone to brigham young specifically to ask whether to attack the fancher party and kill them to close the immigrant trail
1643054 the fortunate thing about all of this is that none of us has to judge brigham young
1643055 i can see a lot of ways that we might want to react to this an easy one is to say that it has nothing to do with us but i think that thats not good enough if we want to take credit for the great things that our pioneer ancestors have done crossing the plains building salt lake if we want to take credit for the spirituality of joseph smith the practicality of brigham young the visionary nature of wilford woodruff we have to accept the other part as part of our heritage too now obviously no one alive is guilty of these murders but they are a part of our history and they deserve to be remembered and the lessons that there might be from this deserve to be integrated into our lives
1643056 we will deal with this situation now so that our hands will be free to meet the army when it comes
1643057 dont you dare kill the fancher party because killing is evil dont let anyone else kill them i hold you personally accountable for their well being
1643058 the procession marched for a mile or so until at a prearranged signal each militiaman turned and shot the emigrant next to him while indians rushed from their hiding place to attack the terrified women and children
1643059 although brigham young and other church leaders in salt lake city learned of the massacre soon after it happened their understanding of the extent of the settlers involvement and the terrible details of the crime came incrementally over time
1643060 kingdom in the west the mormons and the american frontier
1643061 loose in the stacks a half century with the utah war and its legacy
1643062 and the war came jamesbuchanan brigham young and the decision to intervene
1643063 i have nothing to go on but my own sensibilities
1643064 disobeying a stake presidents order to kill people would certainly be desirable
1643065 there isnt any evidence that the events in the book of mormon actually happened
1643066 almost all the events in the bible lack any real evidence also
1643067 yes but the bible is gods word and book of mormon was fabricated by joseph smith
1643068 i really need to get into a new line of work i cant believe how dense these people can be
1643069 you are right they are both equally lacking in evidence
1643070 this might go a little way towards answering your question but there is actually quite a bit of evidence that paul did not write either of the first two scriptures you quote
1643071 he is past the critical point his passions are too strong
1643072 denominational issues and that it is a mistake to extrapolate meaning to all from most of the epistles to a targeted group
1643073 nevertheless neither is the aman without the woman neither the bwoman without the man in the lord
1643074 while the roles of men and women are separate they are unified through christ
1643075 neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord
1643076 as you participate in this conversation and utilize the tools of new media remember who you are latter day saints
1643077 a soft answer turneth away wrath but grievous words stir up anger
1643078 were not exactly a people that do things half way especially in matters that the church gets politically involved in
1643079 i testify that joseph smith was a true prophet of god
1643080 say unto others what you would have them say unto you
1643081 i have desired to organize the sisters in the order of the priesthood
1643082 it opened to women new opportunities for receiving knowledge and intelligence from on high such as through the temple ordinances that were soon to be instituted
1643083 this society shall have power to command queens in their midst queens of the earth shall come and pay their respects to this society they shall come with their millions and shall contribute of their abundance for the relief of the poor if you will be pure nothing can hinder
1643084 heartily thank her for the part played by the rs during the war by releasing tons of wheat to europe
1643085 i dont read anything in the scriptures that specifically ties the gifts of the spirit to the priesthood
1643086 chosen generation a royal kingly priesthood a holy nation a purchased people
1643087 im not sure that is really that foreign of a concept to the lds worldview is it
1643088 i think learning about other faiths is interesting but i fail to see how applying non lds interpretations or information from ex members furthers a discussion on priesthood within the church wouldnt it be more advantageous to rely on the insight of members in good standing at a minimum and better yet those called by god to clarify the finer points of gospel doctrine regarding the priesthood in connection with women
1643089 i was under the impression that the initial post was submitted in connection within an lds context
1643090 clearly in the lds church there is no female priesthood or priesthood and women do not exercise any such authority
1643091 wouldnt it be more advantageous to rely on the insight of members in good standing at a minimum and better yet those called by god to clarify the finer points of gospel doctrine regarding the priesthood in connection with women
1643092 all christian are priests in direct response to the rcc structure
1643093 as a former member you no doubt know that the words of a live prophet are more relevant than those of a dead prophet
1643094 before going any further let me say that i dont have the stomach for yet another long winded and assuredly acrimonious debate about whether and to what extent lds women hold the priesthood and whether they should be included in ecclesiastical leadership positions such posts are legion on the bloggernacle and i have nothing new to add on the subject here
1643095 the glory of god is intelligence d amp c 93 36
1643096 if michelangelo was really a product of his time and culture where did he get these ideas from
1643097 i remember as a kid that i always found it more disturbing that noah would be drunk but now that ive been on long car trips with my own kids im more prone to cut him some slack
1643098 behold the lord hath shown unto me great and marvelous things concerning that which must shortly come at that day when these things shall come forth among you behold i speak unto you as if ye were present and yet ye are not but behold jesus christ hath shown you unto me and i know your doing
1643099 had given his voice against the prophets who testified of jesus
1643100 i soon go to rest in the paradise of god until my spirit and body shall again reunite and i am brought forth triumphant through the air to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great jehovah the eternal judge of both quick and dead amen

1643103 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy
1643104 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1643105 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1643106 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1643107 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1643108 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1643109 so is it about choosing qualified members for leadership who happened to be related to gas or is it just plain nepotism
1643110 whew im certainly never going to be called to anything major
1643111 for what its worth reed benson was my book of mormon instructor at byu he had a heart of gold and he never tried to politically indoctrinate us he was just a sweet old man
1643112 anyway the important thing is this nepotism is only going to be a problem if it continues much longer as the church keeps growing the need to continually call fresh leaders from outside of utah to move into that area and serve in the top leadership is essential i think elder uchtdorf is only the beginning of that trend
1643113 do you think it is more important to me that you be happy or that you be good
1643114 behold this is joy which none receiveth save it be the truly penitent and humble seeker of happiness
1643115 adam fell that humans might be humans are that they may have joy
1643116 the future status and use of the book of mormon in the community of christ
1643117 outside of that i can give room for other explanations that involve mystical processes i think as long as we give way for this mystical we can make religion from it because religion invariable involved mysticism i for one thanks to the presence of plates in the historical record makes me conclude that it relates to an historical era
1643118 and god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female he created them
1643119 since man male and female was created in the image of god it logically follows that this god was both male and female the word our implies more than one so in effect what we have is a god pair consisting of a male god and a female god
1643120 what is the defining characteristic of scripture if job was not a historical person is the message of the book of job diminished
1643121 the pentateuch mirrors this in many ways it is commonly held that moses did not write these books that they are a compilation of works by numerous writers over an extended period of time according to one theory the pentateuch reached its current form around the time of ezra or about 400 b c
1643122 there was a physical object which joseph used to focus his and his contemporaries visions people felt this object through a cloth and they lifted it up when it was sealed in a box

1643142 to go there with the mv agusta with the latest developments coming on stream will be an added bonus adding power and removing some of the excess weight from the stock bike will certainly make my life easier and hopefully will give me the opportunity to challenge for a podium position in the cup race
1643143 we are happy with our progress so far on a small budget and i will be watching very closely this weekend how the first stages of our engine modifications go i expect it will be positive
1643144 after this weekend we will continue development with the engine and the electronics to improve the bikes acceleration out of corners
1643145 we didnt do a good enough job in qualifying which hurt us in the race
1643146 we struggled to find pace and it was hard to stay with the toyotas and renaults who were fighting in the championship lets hope its this track though and that we can bounce back in valencia
1643147 which allowed nick heidfeld to pass me otherwise i couldnt do any more the car has a lot of oversteer and rear sliding now well just focus on the next race and see that we can do there
1643148 for now we are going to keep trying to get some points on every event we are pushing for personal points as well for the drivers championship we are trying to improve on each event
1643149 that is the goal for the season if i can stay in the top ten in the drivers championship then that would be the achievement of a personal goal for the munchis team we want to stay ahead of the suzuki wrt and that would be great for us
1643150 vaguely tanned humans of unknown citizenship status but well just assume theyre illegals because were a bunch of racist dickheads suck
1643151 even though we had good speed at eastern creek it was a pretty disappointing weekend
1643152 we had pole position for the two races but we struggled to get the car off the line and then lost time with the race two incident
1643153 weve had good speed all year and we won a race and finished second in the other at phillip island last time so were confident of being back up the front this weekend
1643154 from one year to the next it is difficult to improve so drastically
1643155 it may be difficult for renault to step up to the level of the top teams in 2009
1643156 never has a team gone from being one of the worst to winning in one year
1643157 and it is the same this season it is so much more competitive than when i was driving in my championship year with
1643158 you really do have a much more difficult task to win three grands prix on the trot as hamilton stood to do should he have triumphed in hungary than you did back then it is just so tight with good drivers in both teams ferrari and

1643161 craig fought his utmost like he always has done but this was one battle he just couldnt win
1643162 craig was a fit lad and he didnt want to give in now was not his time to go
1643163 but thats the character of my boy he was young strong and brave
1643164 we keep thinking hes going to walk through the door or there will be a phone call saying its a mistake but it isnt
1643165 for his mum she always worried about the dark side of the sport i never did you think it will never happen to you
1643166 at three his mum bought him a pw50 yamaha motorcross bike and we played around the fields that backed onto the house
1643167 i took him to race meetings because i used to do grass track racing myself but it wasnt for him and i never pushed him
1643168 then in 1995 he went on to race mini motos and that was it he was hooked
1643169 at seven years old he could ride a yamaha like a speedway rider
1643170 i knew he had something about him and he wanted to win at everything he did
1643171 i hated him racing but he said to me mum you might as well cut off my arms and legs if you say i cant race
1643172 it was what he loved he died doing what he loved best we do take comfort from that
1643173 he told me if i die racing i will die happy
1643174 as i opened the curtains james came through the door and i said your hero is here craig
1643175 im sure that was the moment he went he heard my voice and knew james and his family and best friend tommy hill were there
1643176 someone mentioned to james toseland if he had heard what had happened to jonesy and he put his mic down and rushed from the gig straight to the hospital
1643177 and i just want to thank every single person who has tried to contact us
1643178 if any such attempt was made then indian government will be responsible for the fallout of such a move
1643179 im really pleased that rob will be joining us for road america
1643180 we hope that his busy racing schedule might allow him to return for further alms races but well have to work that out in due course we all wish patrick a speedy recovery and look forward to welcoming him back as soon as he feels able to return to the cockpit
1643181 i may not have been to the track before but im really looking forward to the whole experience

1643195 the findings in this study may be considered encouraging in many ways the average amount of alcohol has decreased in more recently born cohorts the percentage of the population exhibiting moderate alcohol intake has been increasing steadily and the percentage reporting heavy drinking has decreased over time while these data suggest the development of more favorable patterns of alcohol consumption over the latter part of the 20th century that also show that at the same time the cumulative incidence of alcohol use disorders has not shown a decrease and continuing efforts at preventing them are warranted

1643197 acceptance of qrxpharmas streamlined development plan for q8003ir is a measure of success in terms of reduced risk resource efficiencies and potential value of dual opioids we believe this outcome serves to reinforce the soundness of our business strategy to expand the clinical utility of existing compounds and deliver new treatments for targeted indications with well defined paths to regulatory approval and sales
1643198 no additional clinical studies or measures of safety and efficacy beyond those proposed by qrxpharma were requested
1643199 having successfully completed an initial phase 3 trial in april2008 qrxpharma continues to satisfy fda requirements and demonstrate the potential of q8003ir to provide equal or better analgesia with a reduction of total opioid dose and improved tolerability

1643208 using current kidney tests that were developed over 100 years ago 70 percent of kidney function must be lost before damage can be detected the newly approved biomarkers are far more sensitive and specific for drug induced kidney damage
1643209 clinxus has always been dedicated to introducing molecular biomarkers into the clinical trial process
1643210 our role in the next phase of the critical paths pstc effort will be to facilitate the clinical evaluation of these new biomarkers and diagnostic tests
1643211 this result indicates that it is unnecessary to carry the 1500 mg dose forward since the 1000mg dose may provide a greater margin of safety over longer treatment periods without sacrificing efficacy even at the dose of 500mg r7128 in combination with soc has demonstrated a greater percentage of rvr compared to soc alone which provides flexibility in selecting doses for future clinical studies
1643212 the results showed that regardless of gender or race kaletra dosed once daily or twice daily as part of a treatment regimen achieved consistent virologic suppression in patients new to antiretroviral therapy
1643213 additionally the kaletra tablet formulation is a convenient hiv treatment option that can be taken with or without food and does not require refrigeration which is particularly important to patients in the developing world who are disproportionately affected by hiv
1643214 this sub analysis of m05 730 provides additional clinical information on race and gender response with kaletra
1643215 the information can help physicians in making treatment decisions for the patient populations most affected by hiv

1643307 ibu mengapa wajah ayah jadi berkerut merut dan badannya kian hari kian membongkok dan sepertinya ayah menjadi demikian tanpa ada keluhan dan rasa sakit
1643308 anakku jika seorang lelaki yang benar benar bertanggungjawab terhadap keluarga itu memang akan demikian
1643309 saat ku ciptakan lelaki aku membuatnya sebagai pemimpin keluarga serta sebagai tiang penyangga dari bangunan keluarga dia senantiasa akan berusaha untuk menahan setiap hujungnya agar keluarganya merasa aman teduh dan terlindung
1643310 ku ciptakan bahunya yang kuat dan berotot untuk membanting tulang menghidupi seluruh keluarganya dan kegagahannya harus cukup kuat pula untuk melindungi seluruh keluarganya
1643311 ku berikan kemahuan padanya agar selalu berusaha mencari sesuap nasi yang berasal dari titisan keringatnya sendiri yang halal dan bersih agar keluarganya tidak terlantar walaupun seringkali dia mendapat cercaan dari anak anaknya
1643312 ku berikan keperkasaan dan mental baja yang akan membuat dirinya pantang menyerah demi keluarganya dia merelakan kulitnya tersengat panasnya matahari demi keluarganya dia merelakan badannya berbasah kuyup kedinginan dan kesejukan kerana tersiram hujan dan dihembus angin dia relakan tenaga perkasanya dicurahkan demi keluarganya dan yang selalu dia ingat adalah disaat semua orang menanti kedatangannya dengan mengharapkan hasil dari jerih payahnya
1643313 kuberikan kesabaran ketekunan serta kesungguhan yang akan membuat dirinya selalu berusaha merawat dan membimbing keluarganya tanpa adanya keluh kesah walaupun disetiap perjalanan hidupnya keletihan dan kesakitan kerapkali menyerangnya
1643314 ku berikan perasaan cekal dan gigih untuk berusaha berjuang demi mencintai dan mengasihi keluarganya didalam suasana dan situasi apapun juga walaupun tidaklah jarang anak anaknya melukai perasaannya melukai hatinya padahal perasaannya itu pula yang telah memberikan perlindungan rasa aman pada saat di mana anak anaknya tertidur lelap serta sentuhan perasaannya itulah yang memberikan kenyamanan bila saat dia sedang menepuk nepuk bahu anak anaknyaagar selalu saling menyayangi dan saling mengasihi sesama saudara
1643315 ku berikan kebijaksanaan dan kemampuan padanya untuk memberikan pengertian dan kesedaran terhadap anak anaknya tentang saat kini dan saat mendatang walaupun seringkali ditentang bahkan dikotak katikkan oleh anak anaknya
1643316 ku berikan kebijaksanaan dan kemampuan padanya untuk memberikan pengetahuan dan menyedarkan bahawa isteri yang baik adalah isteri yang setia terhadap suaminya isteri yang baik adalah isteri yang senantiasa menemani dan bersama sama menghadapi perjalanan hidup baik suka mahupun duka walaupun seringkali kebijaksanaannya itu akan menguji setiap kesetiaan yang diberikan kepada isteri agar tetap berdiri bertahan sepadan dan saling melengkapi serta saling menyayangi
1643317 ku berikan kerutan diwajahnya agar menjadi bukti bahawa lelaki itu senantiasa berusaha sekuat daya fikirnya untuk mencari dan menemukan cara agar keluarganya dapat hidup didalam keluarga bahagia dan badannya yang terbongkok agar dapat membuktikan bahawa sebagai lelaki yang bertanggungjawab terhadap seluruh keluarganya senantiasa berusaha mencurahkan sekuat tenaga serta segenap perasaannya kekuatannya kesungguhannya demi kelanjutan hidup keluarganya
1643318 ku berikan kepada lelaki tanggungjawab penuh sebagai pemimpin keluarga sebagai tiang penyangga seri penyokong agar dapat dipergunakan dengan sebaik baiknya dan hanya inilah kelebihan yang dimiliki oleh lelaki walaupun sebenarnya tanggungjawab ini adalah amanah di dunia dan akhirat

1643365 this is not a democratic issue or a republican issue it is an issue that affects all of us i am committed to working with all of my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to resolve the energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to act now
1643366 i think for obama the problem is drilling and is alienating environmental activists for mccain the problem is alienating anti tax advocates who are already sort of frustrated with him on some level
1643367 we have to drill here and drill now not wait and see whether theres areas to explore not wait and see whether theres a package that needs to be put together but drill here and drill now
1643368 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1643369 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since theres so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil

1643380 weve got to keep winning games we dont have that big cushion where we can go out oh well we lost this game weve got to keep pace thats something new for a lot of these guys in here myself included
1643381 he looked like he was starting to feel it he was up four straight pitches that to me is when guys will feel it their next outing more than just the pitch count
1643382 his ball moved all over the place inside and out he looked like the playoff beckett
1643383 like with hitters you get a ball to fall and you feel better about yourself
1643384 the one thing he hasnt done is get frustrated and run into more outs hes been an intelligent base runner he got into situations tonight where he could steal it and he did
1643385 you kind of look around and no ones counting on you to be that guy
1643386 youre just a complementary piece to that puzzle i think there was a little bit of relaxation that goes with that i mean since ive been here ive got two guys on base every second or third time i get up there

1643401 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1643402 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1643403 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1643404 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1643405 ive never really understood in all my years why has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1643406 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1643407 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1643408 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1643409 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1643410 i have no idea why ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear

1643424 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1643425 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened

1643435 weve got to work on the ones we have a prayer of saving
1643436 ultimately the decision about whether to actively assist the movement of a species into new territories will rest on ethical and aesthetic grounds as much as on hard science
1643437 passively assisting coral reef migration may be acceptable but transplanting polar bears to antarctica where they would likely drive native penguins to extinction would not be acceptable

1643560 its the economy people made a pretty loud statement tonight
1643561 its shortsighted to say that the present economy keeps us from doing whats best for kids
1643562 our history seems to be that when we have one of these situations if the bond gets defeated then they look at what they really need and come back later with a lower number
1643563 we did the best we could to put the facts out there but in the end the voters own the schools and they think things are ok for now

1643567 although i have only tried it once the taste never compelled me to want to try it again cottage cheese like some natural teas have a very bland flavor that does not exactly satisfy my taste buds that reason alone makes me dislike the dairy product because it does not satisfy me enough to want to try it again
1643568 my partner handed me a spray bottle i closed my eyes to breathe in the fragrance it was similar to the way a flower smells although it had another fragrance as well it had a romantic smell also surely enough i looked at the label to see the name of the body spray and it was called blossoming romance
1643569 ackerman talks about the sense of smell and that we take it for granted and are unaware that everything smells people the air my house my skin 42 all houses have a unique scent i have become so used to the particular odor of my home that i do not actually acknowledge when i am smelling it however some smells are very distinguishable
1643570 ackerman best explains this link between smell and taste in her book when she writes much of the taste of food depends on its smell we taste only four flavors sweet sour salt and bitter that means everything else we call flavor is really odor
1643571 when babies are massaged theyre more active alert and responsive more aware of their surroundings better able to tolerate noise and they orient themselves faster and are emotionally more in control ackerman 73

1643578 students and teachers will be able to buy the online gaming economy documental book at a substantial discount
1643579 i fully expect a sequel to be release within six months
1643580 typically we see interest wane a year after the initial release so it is important to stay on schedule and release subsequent books at pique points of public interest
1643581 it will be a top seller im sure and even though it is meant for those familiar with the online gaming economy literary world many others may find it of general interest as well
1643582 with the release of viggiani wymers new online gaming economy book were going to see record traffic levels
1643583 but were doing it to make sure no unauthorized copies get resold we want to avoid plagiarism and pirating as much as possible furthermore this will be our new procedure for future releases by author vinita uriegas who has pledged support for this system
1643584 pre sale polls show this new online gaming economy book doubling gross sales figures of other recent releases
1643585 and i believe rufener fausetts book may be a complete blockbuster if trends stick well see marked sales numbers within two weeks that will demonstrate year highs
1643586 im happy we were able to release my online gaming economy book on time
1643587 timing is crucial in this market and luckily we chose the right publishers for the job
1643588 this book speaks volumes about the impact of online gaming economy in society and we knew from a business responsibility stand point that releasing it on time would really make a difference
1643589 i think stackpole angelas new docu novel leads readers astray there is too much focus on making the fictional characters function whereas more attention should have been paid to the facts
1643590 i like the fact that it reaches out to those outside of the literary world this is a wise decision and proves a good way to educate others about new things
1643591 i think teaching this story will be highly educational for my online gaming economy students irregardless of what critics believe
1643592 heck if we always listened to critics nothing would be sold they serve a purpose but i leave the fact checking to qualified historians and researchers

1643760 we must begin with the mistake and transform it into what is true that is we must uncover the source of the error otherwise hearing what is true wont help us it cannot penetrate when something is taking its place to convince someone of what is true it is not enough to state it we must find the road from error to truth

1643784 el domingo empieza el desafio la lucha de las regiones
1643785 tras ver las primeras tomas de la serie televisiva en formato cinematografico luc an espectaculares
1643786 sali mucho mejor de lo planeado y tomamos la decisi n de lanzarlo en la pantalla grande as podremos ver un poco mas de asoka la aprendiz de anakin skywalker quien tendr un rol importante en la serie
1643787 las cintas con actores son fotorealistas la animaci n es arte y permite ver mas alla de la realidad con un poco de exageraci n y estilo
1643788 el verdadero desafio es llevar una hora de aventuras que cuesta en el cine us 50 millones por tan solo us 2 millones a la televisi n y sin perder calidad
1643789 la inspiraci n para crear a booster gold me lleg durante las olimpiadas de 1 984 en aquel entonces no estabamos tan comercializados o al menos como ahora un comentarista de oticias hablaba sobre un acuerdo comercial hecho por un atleta antes de las justas sin haber ganado tan solo una medalla una peque a llama se encendi en mi durante un a o y me tom luego un par de dias darle cuerpo al personaje
1643790 me agrada la idea de que se haya convertido en un heroe responsable y competente al que todos consideran un inutil con execpci n de batman si mezclamos eso con su personalidad le a ade un toque de humor nico a la serie
1643791 crec leyendo a estos personajes y me gustaban mucho por su factor nost lgico diferente e interesante cuando iba a empezar a atrabajar en la serie el editor dan didio me comento sobre los adelantos que iban a hacer en cuanto a la adquisici n de estos personajes y que si as lo deseaba podr a introducirlos al universo dc no como nuevas versiones o reencarnaciones sino como los personajes originales me pareci una magnifica idea el revisitar y redefinira estos personajes
1643792 nos tomo mucho tiempo y trabajo hacer esto realidad pero bi n vale la pena desde el primer momento que trabajo en dc comics he querido hacer algo nuevo y emocionante con estos personajes
1643793 el solo concepto de tener a 100 000 personas con los mismos poderes que superman y superchica es algo perturbador en especial cuando ven a la tierra como a un nuevo krypton para superman y superchica al principio parece algo bueno pero no ser nada facil no fueron educados como el no entienden nada de nuestros valores no saben lo que es importante para nosotros y por si fuera poco cientos de soladdos seguidores del general zod estaban en kandor cuando brainiac la redujo
1643794 eso no significa que vamos a dejar de explorar la amistad y el trabajo de equipo de los personajes en las series

1643802 it is our belief that in future the scarcest resource in our world will be consumer attention at starcom mediavest group our vision is to be the leaders of the consumer attention economy
1643803 in 2006 we embarked on a journey to be the masters of the art and science of consumer attention advancing a forward view of consumers and the communication landscape creating and activating transformative ideas that connect brands to consumers and predicting and quantifying consumer outcomes understanding and measuring intent is the central to that initiative
1643804 intent moves us beyond engagement and gets us closer to predicting and assessing a measurable behavioral reaction of the consumer
1643805 the consumers response to a message could be on any of the four platforms consideration deep curiosity validation seeking an opinion expression giving an opinion amp exploration active searching on the web it can ultimately encompass a consumers desire to purchase or recommend a brand
1643806 keeping in view the changing way of doing business this association will tremendously help in positioning the pride hotel as a global brand to reckon with and the business and leisure travellers will have the ease of getting instant confirmation and the best of the deals for their travel and stay

1643811 a graveyard memorial was something that you looked at but with the berlin piece youre amongst it
1643812 its an attempt to convey a feeling of the horror that is being commemorated you do feel cool and you do feel distant and you feel almost a weight above you thats about trying to convey the experience or some sense of the experience of the event or some sort of sense of disorientation which is as physical as it is intelligent
1643813 each stele slab has an individual marking reminiscent of new zealand which tells you about the flora fauna and history
1643814 therefore its an extremely dense memorial and its extremely exciting
1643815 i dont find it very special its quite ordinary some of us on the jury wanted anish kapoor who put forward a wonderful design rising out of the serpentine lake with seats either side like an amphitheatre so people could sit down and contemplate
1643816 we had to think hard about what diana was like and who she was and what she meant to people in the end we thought anishs proposal caught the spirit of dianas character and that it would excite people they would travel from all over to visit it
1643817 you cant go through the main street of the capital of the most powerful country on earth without seeing it
1643818 its like a trench in the landscape and you cant help but realise the enormity of this trench and the wall of names and thats what has the effect its very effective because its so simple
1643819 i dont think showing off in a memorial is an appropriate thing to do at all and thats why the vietnam one in washington works so well its utterly minimal
1643820 its very moving because its so simple and monumental and definitive its lodged itself in everyones mind unlike the more recent one to the women of world war ii
1643821 i cant get why that was considered a good way to memorialise the women of wwii to have empty coats
1643822 it doesnt say anything about their contribution and it rather underplays their role its very puzzling and quite annoying
1643823 its quite staggering and moving it starts off with a series of empty chairs around an empty round table and then you walk in a line through a park towards a kind of gate
1643824 its got embracing figures curved into the stone and then you walk quite a way right through the town in a straight line and gradually you come to this thing up ahead of you which is this incredible column climbing into the sky
1643825 its very isolated so in that respect its very alone but the fact its shooting upwards its not too melancholy theres some sort of hope there especially for people who are religious
1643826 i would rather die than see you take reiko from me my death by your blade will be enough for her to hate you until you part ways
1643827 andy won it last year and set the record and ive looked up to andy for a long time so its kind of weird to be seen in his position
1643828 ive only done the event once before and that was two years ago
1643829 so its kind of weird to skip ahead to the front when i got like 23rd two years ago
1643830 mark is probably the best rower out here since hes been training the last eight weeks
1643831 we kind of specialized the boat to have a rudder in the back which i guess is legal
1643832 the strategy most people had was sprint to the island first and once we got there it was pretty easy going around and coming back
1643833 i was just planing on going faster than i did last year
1643834 its kind of the same last year was really cool because i hadnt won it before so i was like oh my gosh but its still really cool
1643835 i noticed that but just kind of cut around it
1643836 its the 81st year and its just a really neat family event
1643837 we have kids 8 and under swimming the lake and people into their 70s swimming this year so its just a neat atmosphere and with the boats and the rower and the spotter its a team effort
1643838 im just not sure this is where i want to be when christ returns ild rather be helping someone or on my knees praying i dont want him to return and find me sitting in a theater
1643839 this guy may be a theological crackpot but hes got some really good things to say
1643840 in the parable of the sower jesus explained that the seed is the truth the word of god
1643841 congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press

1643846 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad
1643847 sh t i like dana more than i like jesurgislac and dana is near pathological in his desire to throw people in jail hes a messed up monkey but i still feel his humanity despite some of the missing parts

1643852 we are very proud of the work submitted by these youngsters they are changing the way the industry is and the way it is viewed these very talented students are already work ready and with some able guidance and training will be producers of very intense and exquisite work
1643853 it was exciting to work with the young minds and it was an experience and learning for me they were so dynamic hard working and so swift that they surpassed my expectations
1643854 telecom sites in indonesia have traditionally depended on diesel to power their repeater stations and cell sites
1643855 in addition to being environmentally damaging diesel power has proven to be costly and difficult to maintain in remote areas leading to frequent breakdowns of diesel gensets solar power thus serves as an effective replacement for diesel gensets in remote sites with poor grid connection while also providing a cost friendly solution for reliable clean and efficient power
1643856 telkomsel is deeply committed to supporting clean energy development and environmental conservation we are proud to commit ourselves to reducing our energy consumption and carbon emissions with market leading renewable energy solutions and exceptional technical expertise
1643857 the electronic spot trading will allow producers to get the best possible price for their commodity at a given point of time since buyers from all across the country will be able to buy commodities through the national apmc it will unlock unprecedented value through benefits from better prices transparent trading guaranteed trades better warehousing and logistics and lower marketing costs for farmers traders and consumers
1643858 we will initially focus on these two states and later expand our presence to other states we plan to reach out to all the 7 500 agricultural produce marketing committees apmcs across the country over the next one year said
1643859 akash with his rich experience and in depth knowledge of media industry is sure to bring in great value addition for our organisation i am sure with his leadership our team will create great entertainment for our listeners i would like to welcome akash in this big family and look forward to a great innings with him
1643860 i remember when my familys company multimedia marketing group flew danny from the uk to our little redneck town in oregon to teach the company search optimization my dad still swears that they invented the term search engine optimization that day i think that was in 1997 or thereabouts
1643861 reality is that which when you stop believing in it doesnt go away
1643862 well we had a six run lead last night and blew that so two runs is nothing
1643863 poked to left field and down for a hit and seattle has retaken the lead
1643864 well significant profits next quarter with the release of our new las vegas nevada politics products
1643865 and they took it very seriously confidentiality especially in the las vegas nevada politics market is of core important and these students were able to finish a great analysis without duress
1643866 i always tell my las vegas nevada politics clients to wait at minimum 18 months before evaluating the success of a particular investment
1643867 that way those who get jittery early on allow themselves a chance to see the investment through
1643868 im thrilled to report record growth in the las vegas nevada politics sector
1643869 this signifies that anyone who invested their money more than three years ago saw a 25 return on their money which is fabulous
1643870 weve seen more people getting into investing and more company executives doing more aggressive marketing and sales with the knowledge that they are backed by a diverse number of share holders
1643871 its a shame that our industry isnt seen as more main stream
1643872 if more main stream investors got involved through good brokerages wed see a higher division of risk across the board this is especially important in our business model because if we rely on one or two large investment firms they can end up constantly twisting our elbows
1643873 las vegas nevada politics investing may seem daunting to some
1643874 but its really no different than the enigma of day trading or forex people are not necessarily afraid of investment process but merely of the high risk involved
1643875 its better to look through the mid range las vegas nevada politics companies for ones with strong growth potential
1643876 be prepared for a wait of on average 3 5 years before expecting any sort of return that is the way the las vegas nevada politics market works and with patience you can walk with big money
1643877 are key qualities to have in the las vegas nevada politics sector if you want to excel

1643886 london is one of the most vibrant poker cities in the world and the game is as popular as ever
1643887 our leagues have seen waves of new players coming through our doors and learning the game and poker in the park will be the perfect chance for those who havent been bitten by the bug to finally see why we love the game so much
1643888 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1643889 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1643890 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1643891 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1643892 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1643893 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1643894 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1643895 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1643896 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1643897 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1643898 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1643899 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear

1643902 they still havent made a decision on pakistan so until that time comes well see what happens
1643903 i think im going to wait until they say so and then make that decision on that day
1643904 destinations for which we advise you to reconsider your need to travel
1643905 we continue to receive a stream of credible reports indicating terrorists are in the advanced stages of planning attacks these attacks could target western or australian interests and individuals and places frequented by foreigners and could occur at any time attacks may be launched anywhere in pakistan including major cities
1643906 we want to go over and play in safety we want to make sure that were safe when were playing in any country so its not just pakistan its any country
1643907 as long as were safe and weve been guaranteed that all the security measures are right and so and so then theres no reason why we cant go
1643908 the selections on the night gave us the right options to be able to attack the new zealanders where we wanted to
1643909 unfortunately we werent accurate in the lineout play and that compromised us
1643910 its one of those things you can pick a taller lineout but irrespective of who you pick you have to be accurate in your skill
1643911 i thought the first two matches we met those physical challenges last week against new zealand we probably didnt
1643912 theres no denying it was a performance that wasnt good but i think the signs generally have been there
1643913 theres a lot of excitement about whats happening at the moment and they will be busting to get back into it to put that performance behind them
1643914 it was a little out of character and we will be doing our best to rectify that
1643915 i hope this brings you the closure that you seek

1643919 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media lapdogs
1643920 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1643921 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1643922 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes

1643928 there is an inner core of intimate associates who unquestionably knew that they were members of a group devoted to a common purpose and an outer circle of a larger number on whom the inner circle acted by personal pursuasion patronage distribution and social pressure it is probable that most members of the outer circle were not conscious that they were being used by a secret society
1643929 their aim is nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole
1643930 displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy
1643931 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media
1643932 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
1643933 the cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1643934 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1643935 attempt to try as it were id say to diffuse the whole situation
1643936 the problem was the cheney crowd was in too much of a hurry really bush never resisted them quite strongly enough
1643937 the white house then buried the habbush report they instructed the british that they were no longer interested in keeping the channel open
1643938 the brits wanted to avoid war which was what was driving them bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office
1643939 there was no such order from the white house to me or to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
1643940 that the intelligence organisations knew that saddam had no weapons of mass destruction
1643941 bush is innocent until proven guilty or have we forgotten that
1643942 john charles menezes clothing had added to suspicions he was challenged and refused to obey police instructions
1643943 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1643944 tenet turns to richard as he remembers it and says listen marine richard is a former marine youre not going to like this but here goes
1643945 displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy
1643946 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate
1643947 cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media
1643948 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence
1643949 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous

1643958 to put a permanent pc connection in a coffee shop and link it to internet
1643959 you dont even need a computer you can just go to a public library or you can go to an internet caf there is no control no regulation and no laws nobody is censoring the messages
1643960 you can sit in a coffee shop an internet caf in london use a server in south africa and send a message to north america without anybody being able to trace it
1643961 juveniles to enter or allowing unhealthy information to spread through internet followed by indian governments crackdown on net caf where the owners were asked
1643962 cyber cafes in pakistan will soon be made accountable as the government is all set to draft a law to regulate their activities
1643963 the state or quality of being secluded from the view and or presence of others
1643964 individuals are entitled to keep to themselves what they do online or offline unless some special situation like public interest in general demands otherwise in a civilized society no body has the right whatsoever to snoop over others
1643965 the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others
1643966 imagine what ordinary users do when they log on they check email and fire off replies chat surf some sites brows or play games what is there to be secretive or cautious about however cafes may be registered with some central authority seating arrangements in them should be open screen facing outwards this alone will clear so many doubts about the policy of any caf and will define the kind of crowd that gathers there
1643967 this is not the best way to track back miscreants any one up to some thing bad can sure outmanoeuvre such barriers big worry is that will any rule shift the onus of customers actions on caf owners or will we be made accomplice if and when something wrong happens
1643968 i am located near the university of the punjab hostels and my clients are mostly serious student who come here for preparing their assignments i try to provide them with an academic atmosphere in the cafe they search brows download documents and get required material printed or save it on their floppy disks for later use or they sit her and compose their assignments
1643969 i have some regular clients who can hardly read or write english but they have learnt to operate computers and internet what do you think they do online stop them and they will go find another cafe if the government has to ban pornographic sites isps should be regulated and not the net cafes
1643970 the scene in net cafes in multan is no different than any other city in the country some 70 to 80 per cent of the visitors come for entertainment whereas only 20 per cent visit for educational pursuits most of the visitors are male young boys in posh areas however female students are also seen visiting
1643971 i travel to different places all over the country in connection with my work and have to use net cafes to stay in constant touch with my company i use the nearest cyber caf where ever i happen to be i will revert back to telephone if some legal procedures are introduced to use the cafes
1643972 i do not want to get into legalities later on
1643973 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb

1643979 petrohawks haynesville shale investment has created over a decade of drilling opportunities for our company in this awesome natural gas play
1643980 since our first quarter conference call we have doubled our position in the haynesville shale our leasing and acquisition efforts are disciplined and strategic as we continue to add acreage in the heart of the play our proven ability to optimize costs and provide attractive price realizations are unique advantages we will use to capitalize on this play and grow our company in fact our operating costs on a per unit basis actually continue to drop while many of our competitors have reported cost increases
1643981 as we stand at mid year petrohawk is reaping the benefit of its initial investment in the fayetteville shale and other core properties and we have embarked on a new exciting phase of growth we estimate that proved reserves grew organically by approximately 25 at mid year and that figure does not yet take into account any contribution from the haynesville shale for production we expect our 2008 exit rate will be 50 higher than our 2007 exit rate and project 2008 average annual production will have grown more than 25 year over year pro forma for acquisitions and divestitures as our haynesville program accelerates throughout 2009 we expect to set even more aggressive goals for the company production in 2009 is expected to average 30 40 higher than 2008 during this period of accelerated growth the company will continue to value risk management through a low cost structure and hedging and maintain a capital structure sufficient to realize the value of our significant resource potential

1643993 he has been diagnosed to be deaf there is an early intervention program for your child
1643994 most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be
1643995 what does the deaf child bring to the family that is unique and wonderful what does the deaf person bring to the human race that is unique and wonderful
1643996 you dont take everything they say as the final say on anything and everything
1643997 what is best for my child but they deny of course their own interests and for its future thus more on individualistic terms
1643998 is it fair that cochlear implant babies are not allowed to learn asl and instead they are required to speak when hearing babies can learn both asl and verbal communication your opinion of a ci persons own identity deaf or hearing
1643999 its great to be deaf and being deaf is natural and nothing is wrong with that
1644000 its the attitude that makes the person succeed in being warmly embraced by people of that culture if the person is open and positive willing to learn from the people to take criticism and challenges and is real and appreciative whenever people welcome them that would define a successful acculturation
1644001 because there are a large number of deaf people who are acculturating into the deaf culture it is expected to have some
1644002 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1644003 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1644004 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1644005 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1644006 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions
1644007 ultimately only china can decide what course it will follow

1644017 the historical antecedents on the languages of signs in spain began from the educative point of view in century xvi when the monks undertook the work to educate deaf children benedictine monk d pedro ponce of leon taught how to communicate to the children
1644018 pedro ponce of leon had to include understand that was possible to express the reason without speech because he himself did whenever he showed his thoughts by means of monastic signs used with the deaf children a gestural system of communication
1644019 this book aims essentially at two goals the first is putting into place the work of the spaniards who invented and developed methods for the education of deaf mutes settling unequivocally that they have their origins in spain with ponce de leon and bonet the second goal which distinguishes hervas as advance to the modern language of signs is proof that sign language is a sign of human language among others as english russian or chinese this purpose beyond the ideas that enciclopedistas and french philosophers as condillac and diderot had on sign language
1644020 wherever the deaf have received an education the method by which it is imparted is the burning question of the day with them for the deaf are what their schooling make them more than any other class of humans they are facing not a theory but a condition for they are first last and all the time the people of the eye
1644021 we need room and relaxed opportunities to be creative to dream to imagine what it would be like nowadays if 127 years of oralism never existed and to act upon that creatively

1644037 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1644038 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1644039 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1644040 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1644041 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1644042 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1644043 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence
1644044 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1644045 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1644046 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner

1644049 we are keen to support the availability of more medicines over the counter where it is safe to do so making this medicine available from a pharmacy is a real example of how we are enabling people to play an active role in taking charge of their own healthcare
1644050 claims by labour that gordon brown is best able to steer the country through the economic crisis are simply not believed by voters labours reputation for economic competence has been torn to shreds
1644051 on current estimates the television advertising market has weakened in september where tough year on year comparisons apply given the rugby world cup in 2007
1644052 whilst itv has limited visibility on advertising revenues beyond september itv expects to outperform the total market over the full year
1644053 in the light of the weaker advertising and economic outlook
1644054 the change to the previous target also reflects regulatory delay to the planned kangaroo service we expect to meet the revised online target without relying on substantial acquisitions
1644055 the board remains confident that the turnaround strategy will deliver sustainable long term growth and is therefore maintaining its investment in programming
1644056 we cannot control the economic environment in which we operate
1644057 as a result of the recent slowdown in the television advertising market the board has taken some tough decisions which are reported here today
1644058 in the light of the uncertain economic outlook and the importance of maintaining programming investment
1644059 no sooner have companies breathed a sigh of relief about returning to surplus but they are back to multi billion pound deficits
1644060 with a possible recession looming and the threat of further regulatory intervention the outlook for continuing defined benefit provision seems rather bleak
1644061 it is inevitable that employers will keep on closing schemes to both new and existing members especially in the face of so much uncertainty around the funding and costs this is the final chapter
1644062 final salary pensions promise will soon be a thing of the past for private sector workers
1644063 i have always thought that the congestion charge is a blunt instrument it has proved successful in cutting traffic coming into london but on its own has not resolved the problem of congestion various works and schemes going on in the capital have also eroded its impact i am therefore introducing a more comprehensive approach to easing congestion in london
1644064 congestion would be a lot worse were it not for the charge
1644065 tfl needs to manage the roadworks better which is plainly possible traffic lights can also be rephased by giving less green time to pedestrians and more to traffic
1644066 without the congestion charge the traffic problems in london would be much worse however as a result of other interventions such as utility and construction works the reduction in road space has had a detrimental impact on congestion levels and is slowing traffic down
1644067 this is not a blame game all we want is for hsbc to facilitate the delivery of our presents
1644068 we believe this would be easily achieved and could actually be cheaper than organising refunds the deliveries could be organised at cost price and would be a huge publicity coup for them it could save them money as well
1644069 were going to remind hsbc that there is more than just numbers involved and that they have an opportunity to do the right thing and help everybody including themselves
1644070 hsbcs view is that this should never have happened and had the directors acted sooner to address their financial difficulties and appointed administrators when hsbc recommended it may not have happened
1644071 hsbc fully appreciates how wrapits customers feel about this issue and understands their distress and concern that a resolution be found quickly
1644072 labour have said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing
1644073 it is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest free environment but the level and variety of these infections is concerning we need greater transparency in nhs infection control and publishing data like this is one way in which we can drive up overall hygiene standards
1644074 such findings are truly revolting how can patients be safe amid bed bugs fleas and rats once again safety is just rhetoric and not a reality for patients particularly the elderly and those with suppressed immunity
1644075 what about those trusts who ignored this freedom of information request and said nothing if these are the standards of those coming clean what does it say about those who stayed silent these findings reveal what happens when money is taken away from where patients expect to see it spent if these hospitals were restaurants they would be closed down and out of business nhs trust boards must get a grip and show patients they are serious about their legal responsibility for safety
1644076 the use of pest control is seen as good proactive management
1644077 the healthcare commission have confirmed that health concerns around pest control have to date been negligible
1644078 the claim that insects spread hospital acquired infections is entirely unproven there is no evidence of their carriage of antibiotic resistant bacteria being a hazard to patients despite this we expect hospitals to take continued action to tackle these pest problems
1644079 weve had bursaries for potential officers for a number of years
1644080 if they are able to stick with their college course they are probably more motivated and more self disciplined and are the sort of characters we want to join the army
1644081 a lot of growing up takes place between 16 and 18 we know that a year at college can make a huge amount of difference
1644082 by providing a financial incentive and allowing people to get through their college education we are getting a hugely better educated more mature motivated and informed young person
1644083 a lot of it is because they simply havent thought through what being in the army is about
1644084 we would expect them to join the army as soon as possible after completing their courses
1644085 they have to sign up for the minimum of four years
1644086 a lot of students in fe particularly here in lewisham need all the financial help they can get
1644087 some of them are under pressure from parents to leave college and get a job this is a little financial incentive to support them through
1644088 this just in the dead and actually fucking the hell out of the living i repeat the dead are fucking the hell out of the living stay in doors
1644089 the giddings field has been the incubator of many new ideas and technological improvements to oil field technologies that have transferred to other oil fields around the world it is the largest oil field found in texas during the last fifty years technologies and procedures such as acid treatments large fracture treatments seismic horizontal drilling multilateral wells and underbalanced or controlled pressure drilling work together as a drilling and completion system to make the giddings field a hotbed of activity we plan to utilize some of the same locally experienced drilling operators and follow the same proven well re entry and completion processes for our leased acreage

1644091 we are very excited and proud to be partnering with bp a world leader in both the traditional and alternative energy industries that shares our commitment and vision to rapidly evolve next generation ethanol into a commercial scale solution for our energy needs
1644092 in addition to bps world class capabilities in traditional energy production logistics and distribution their commitment to accelerate the development of the global biofuels market was a significant factor in our decision to partner with bp in addition both organizations are aligned on the significant market opportunity and operational imperatives for achieving rapid commercial scale success
1644093 bp is very pleased to be entering this important relationship with verenium we believe energy crops like sugar cane miscanthus and energy cane are the best feedstocks to deliver economic sustainable and scaleable biofuels to the world this deal puts us at the front of the cellulosic biofuels game
1644094 in partnering with verenium we now have the most advanced technology for transforming these energy grasses to biofuels increasing our ability to invest earlier in the us to meet the requirements for cellulosic ethanol laid out in the recent energy bill we also have the possibility of enhancing the productivity of our brazilian assets verenium has already demonstrated the technology making this real and an appropriate fit with our commitment to bring more sustainable biofuels to the market more quickly

1644103 reading between the signs workbook a cultural guide for sign language students and interpreters
1644104 in cross cultural encounters it is easy to jump to an erroneous conclusion about another persons motives behavior and character when we base our judgements on assumptions from our own culture one way to arrest our rush to judgement is to separate out three aspects of perceiving anothers behavior d i e is an easy to remember initialism that might come in handy but actually gaining the skills involved requires some practice
1644105 many deaf people do not have a complete understanding of deaf culture
1644106 nothing can be changed you have to accept it like this
1644107 understanding the diversity better and including yourself and respect the differences
1644108 we from deaf residential schools are the deaf culture the rest of you arent
1644109 you must conform to this way of thinking if not you will be rejected
1644110 we from deaf residential schools are the deaf culture the rest of you arent
1644111 please dont sign in front of anyone but only in the room
1644112 youve just got to keep playing better and hopefully play yourself back into that huddle and until then youve just got to keep making plays
1644113 yeah i mean thats the goal is to get back out there with jay
1644114 brandon he makes five or six great plays every practice so hes definitely our go to guy and were going to miss him those first couple of games
1644115 but weve got guys who are going to step up weve got veterans in keary colbert and darrell jackson and weve got a young eddie royal whos having a great camp so weve got guys who are going to step up and once brandon gets back its full steam ahead
1644116 if you take a look at what ive done toward the second half of each season you would hope that i could start off that way and kind of carry that throughout the whole season
1644117 thats something ive wanted to do trust me and something im planning on doing just staying healthy staying ahead of the game and just kind of naturally let everything take place
1644118 and i think thats a reasonable goal for me to be up there among the top tight ends
1644119 ive got to play well this season to prove i want to get a part of this
1644120 i think he has the experience where he doesnt really need the preseason games
1644121 hopefully in the next couple weeks we can get him back and he will be ready for the first regular season game
1644122 follow me and i will make you fish for people
1644123 the appropriate conceptual frame for understanding the management of colonized occupied spaces and subjugated populations
1644124 runs the risk of erasing the active agency of the palestinian subject represented as either passive victim of israeli dispossession or aggressive insurgent but with interpretative control wrested away
1644125 the inclusion of israel in the state of exception debate
1644126 tempting as it might be it can reinforce the global immunity israel receives for its membership in the camp of democratic states the very discussion of israel within the parameters of this debate assumes that israel is another case of a western liberal democracy dangerously deteriorating into the abyss dreaded by agamben
1644127 israel uses oppression to defend it against democracy leading to the maintenance of the state of oppression
1644128 de democratizing israel could give palestinian resistance hope for change if israel is seen as a permanent state of oppression the palestinians may glimpse a light at the end of their tunnel of suffering and abuse
1644129 israel is a scandalous case of the modern paradigm of sovereignty because it reveals what lies beneath the smooth surface of other countries the persistence of the exception in israel the ongoing state of emergency the violent moment of birth and the persistence of its ethnic nature are features that one might find in some countries at some points in time israel is unique in that all of these features are present most of the time
1644130 palestine has become the emblematic solidarity movement of our time our spanish civil war our cuba our nicaragua the use of palestine as shorthand for inter ethnic conflict and seemingly intractable difference has taken on a new significance with outcomes that are bad for palestinians and for antiracism in many other places
1644131 talk about palestine without much attention to the situation of palestinians
1644132 a highly intelligent and enterprising race backed by large financial resources
1644133 a comparatively poor indigenous community on a different cultural level
1644134 it is not that might makes right in this case it is that might manufactures the conditions and parameters the terms of political and by extension historical and representational possibility
1644135 problematic position as an exiled citizen of israel and as such a member of the perpetrator group in relation to representing palestinian subjectivity
1644136 a kind of memory that was deliberately and systematically hidden
1644137 orientalist discourses of remaking and interpreting the east especially the use of womens rights to construct a picture of palestinian society as primitive and the tendency to present palestinians as native informants rather than experts
1644138 were not interested in hearing palestinians present any overarching political narrative
1644139 is an issue which israeli organizations need to promote more than palestinian ones
1644140 theres probably no god now stop worrying and get on with your life

1644145 but not only has mccain not peddled any of it hes condemned it
1644146 to my knowledge senator mccain has never mentioned senator obamas race much less in the tone senator obama implied
1644147 effectively assured that race would once again become an unavoidable issue
1644148 i advised jesse helms to do what hes always done
1644149 the prolonged alienation from the outside world and improper food might have created adverse effects on their mental and physical state

1644152 i have to go to the washroom help me sit i will eat when qaiser come
1644153 i know a man who is our enemy but now he is our friend my son never treated us in a severe manner and he used to give us proper food
1644154 we will trace qaiser question him and later hand him over to the doctors for medical checkup but right now it is unjustifiable to lodge an fir against him and send him to jail
1644155 coders who explore technology through innovation and research play a vital role in developing and securing the software and hardware we use everyday yet this important work can be stymied by bogus legal threats
1644156 effs coders rights project will provide a front line defense for coders facing legal challenges for legitimate research activities
1644157 those of us doing research on computer security and privacy need to be able to discuss and publish our work without fear of legal threats
1644158 the coders rights project will give critical legal help to programmers and developers who do the hard work in keeping technology robust and users safe
1644159 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
1644160 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
1644161 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
1644162 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1644163 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1644164 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1644165 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1644166 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1644167 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1644168 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature
1644169 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood
1644170 their bodies wont be able to tolerate pregnancy and delivering children
1644171 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
1644172 a once or twice a century event deeply rooted in fears of insolvency of major institutions
1644173 if that becomes widespread globalisation could reverse at awesome cost

1644176 hoe fuck you bitch you turned me fucking down hoe i hope you drop dead
1644177 its totally unfair the insurance company hasnt paid out and this has become about money
1644178 everyone not just teenagers should be very careful when they have a drink or hire a moped and always make sure they are fully covered even if it means reading the boring small print
1644179 it has been just terrible seeing her all swollen up like after a fight
1644180 charlottes eyes are a third closed and she cant talk or smile but she blinked looking at pictures of her gran
1644181 the doctor was more positive today but she could regress any time over the next month and they cant rule out brain damage or epilepsy
1644182 she had insurance and she got on the back of a moped not the front
1644183 you are required to take all reasonable care to protect yourself and your property and to act as though you are not insured
1644184 the policy of insurance has strict terms and conditions which need to be adhered to for the policy to be valid
1644185 under the general exclusions applying to all sections of the policy it states no section of this policy shall apply in respect of your drug addiction or solvent abuse excessive alcohol intake or you being under the influence of alcohol or drug s
1644186 we would further point out that no section of the policy shall apply in respect of any claims arising from needless self exposure to peril except in an endeavour to save a human life
1644187 the information in our possession indicates that the serious injuries were sustained as a result of the above exclusions and ms robinsons claim has consequently been declined
1644188 you dont expect this type of thing at a cricket match it was disgusting
1644189 i shouted stop it you stupid people there are kids about i think the loud blast of the tannoy brought them back to their senses
1644190 it was one silly man who decided to start something and then it all kicked off
1644191 im a cyclist and use public transport a lot my main concern is whether the proposals are going far enough because currently the amount of traffic on the road is ridiculous
1644192 i think they are going to do what they want regardless of what we say
1644193 these so called improvements will not benefit most people my company is considering moving out of manchester because the expense
1644194 they have sent out quite a lot of information but im a bit cynical
1644195 slowly but surely we have seen a steady decline in pump prices which was initiated by the supermarket price war however the diesel price has crept up slightly in the last day or so
1644196 global prices are still considerably higher than they were just one year ago when oil was just over 70 dollars per barrel
1644197 we feel that pump prices should be dropping further to reflect the new wholesale costs
1644198 this is an environmentally friendly way to have it delivered because the boat doesnt use as much diesel as lorries
1644199 at this point were making an association between the parent case and children bottles storing that in a database thats what we call our commissioning event for the bottles as theyre being born with a license plate
1644200 at this point weve tagged more than two million bottles
1644201 were seeing performance rates of 99 983 percent in terms of tags that have performed post packaging one of the things i attribute that to is a good qa process at our label converter which identifies and rejects any bad tags before we ever see them the performance range is acceptable but no bad tags go out the door if an rfid tag doesnt read properly it goes through a rework process so that 100 percent of the bottles go out with readable rfid tags
1644202 there are plenty of vendors out there making tags in various form factors the same with equipment we conducted preliminary qualification studies tested our packaging and ran it through both our labs and vendor labs to gather some readings on what our potential success might be we narrowed the field coordinated vendors for additional testing and put together protocols ours was not an out of the box solution
1644203 we excitedly waited for our first set of rfid labels to arrive in our packaging department
1644204 the supplier backed down on the tensioner and sent us another set of label rollstock with the rfid tags embedded this second set looked great but as our engineer moved the web to the packaging line the entire roll unwound like the worlds largest paper telescope that was two down like the story with the three bears the third time the supplier got the web tensioning just right
1644205 we had to make decisions early on at some risk as to choosing technologies that we felt the industry would accept
1644206 we had some experience already because of the wal mart initiative so we decided to move forward with rfid though we are looking at 2d bar coding as a redundant feature because a lot of our industry partners view it as a more reachable interim solution
1644207 we use gen 2 rfid with oxycontin bottles and cases and we use a linear bar code on pallets
1644208 they are facing not a theory but a condition for they are first last and all the time the people of the eye

1644210 bangladeshis have found a better place to live and work now and the administration is highly responsible to categorise these influx people as legal indians with duplicate pass port with the administration help the bangladeshis now not only involved themselves with work and living rather they are now intend to rule us by playing elections
1644211 our state is slowly and steadily going to the hands of these bangladeshis but the students wont let this happen and will fight all to stop it for a better future when the govt is not taking care of our structural academy rather it has ruined our future with these migrants bangladeshis are now not only the problem of the state but it has also affecting the other parts of the country as we can see the hands of simi huji involved in the insane activities in india
1644212 we dont consider any political barricade over a matter of our state and its existence the fence are open the migrants are playing elections high court said the authority to stop the influx what else the govt need to act
1644213 we still believe in satyagraha and follow the principles of non violence but there should be some reciprocation from the govt but how long the students will shut their eyes on it
1644214 we have information that kamaluddin ahmed who played election here and being found guilty under assam accord is still inside the state though the court has passed his deportation reports even after its proved informed tapan gogoi gs of aasu
1644215 its time for bloggers and yes vloggers too to take accountability in how we use language to critically examine our deaf lives and to explore ways to push for a stop to deficit thinking and to push for critical examination of the audistic system we need to devote our energies and creativities to topple
1644216 that deficit thinking spills over to the deaf community influencing us to tear each other down over minor details rather than the big picture or big ideas and goals
1644217 it is not our backgrounds who we hang with who our parents are or how well we sign its our attitude influenced or not by deficit thinking that either unites or divides us
1644218 i am with you ella on generating an open mindedness and appreciation of differences in our people those that have a healthy and mature perspective of what having a good discussion as you would say are teachable and those that arent sad to say are not

1644229 the deaf as a class have had little cause to love him because of the nature of his interference in their affairs neither his great inventor nor his great wealth rendered him infallible but the fame of the one and the glamour of the other made him the most powerful and influential figure in america deaf mute education for thirty years past he chose to use this wealth and influence along lines that have been constantly condemned by the great mass of the educated deaf of our country he denied these educated deaf he privilege to decide which methods and means of education were best for the younger generation of their kind in this respect he was like the pigeon that defends its nest but not its eggs or young he was concerned more with the manner of their education than with the deaf themselves

1644233 the proposed offer price fully and fairly values lonmins asset base and growth pipeline while recognizing the inherent risks time and investment required to restore production to previous levels

1644240 when people become so blinded by ideology they commit crimes that trample the rights of their neighbors and put lives in danger the fbi must act
1644241 we hope this reward serves as an incentive to take the often difficult step of bringing important information to the attention of law enforcement
1644242 the whole idea of domestic terrorism is definitely a high priority especially in a case like this where lives were placed in danger
1644243 we hope to glean enough from the video to determine how many people are involved and their basic descriptions to corroborate some leads we have gotten up to today

1644259 we carry out regular inspections on all our hospital sites and take pest control very seriously
1644260 labour have said over and over again they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show they are failing
1644261 how can patients be safe amid bed bugs fleas and rats if these are the standards of those coming clean what does it say about those who stayed silent
1644262 the health care commission have confirmed health concerns around pest control have to date been negligible

1644269 we replaced the whole line from the infeed to the exit
1644270 we replaced the bottle descrambler the bottle cleaner the filling systems the capper the induction sealer the labeler and the case packer
1644271 but because of the four liter bottle we use an infeed hopper thats about 10 times the size of the others
1644272 before we could only unload bottles six at a time
1644273 now we can dump a case of 24 at a time
1644274 it picks up the bottles inverts them blows air in and then pulls a vacuum to draw the air out before returning the bottles to the line
1644275 theres a feedback loop that will either slow down or speed up the auger
1644276 as the powder builds up on the auger over time on a shift it has to go faster to provide the same amount and rate
1644277 most in line cappers have no problems with a standard bottle but when you have an offset neck theres a challenge because you dont want to cap it and indent the top of the bottle
1644278 if its on loose it will be rejected due to height
1644279 the system also informs us whether the labels on if its skewed or if its straight
1644280 when a machine is down it automatically stops the upstream machine so the bottles dont back up
1644281 and when a machine starts running again the upstream machines restart automatically
1644282 we really did our homework so everything is running as designed
1644283 and were getting the actual output speed that we requested sometimes you ask for a speed and vendors give it to you but only if youre running at 100 percent capacity yet were hitting the actual speed that we requested while running this line at around 80 percent of capability
1644284 if it wasnt for coach making us do 100 yard sprints five or six or seven times half fields gassers wed be out of breath by the second quarter
1644285 were starting fresh this is our first year of two a days everythings new to us winnings going to be new to us too
1644286 overnight youre not going to go from a 1 9 team to a 9 1 team just by doing nothing i think these kids realize that they want to win nobody enjoys losing you dont put all that work in to go out there and lose on friday nights
1644287 these kids realize i think through the first couple of days that theyre going to do better and theyre going to be competitive but theyre going to have to work hard
1644288 i think well have a much better chance to win games this year since we have new coaches and a lot of new players it is different but i think its different in a good way
1644289 everybody was showing up in the summer and working hard so it pays off to get ready for the heavy running in the heat that the first days of august brings
1644290 the first week here is just basically conditioning a lot of those kids are going to have to play almost all the time and to stay with those teams that have 30 or 40 or 50 kids they have to be in shape
1644291 they cant get in that last quarter and just be wiped out thats just not an option we have here
1644292 couldnt believe it ive played since i got in middle school just to come out here and think its my last year and ive got 10 more games left its a little sad but it just makes me want to play harder
1644293 this is my last year im going to go out hitting hard im just going to try to have a little fun and have a great time
1644294 you look at it like you were a freshman once when youre team captain youve got to help everybody
1644295 with the opportunity comes more responsibility but its something i enjoy i truly enjoy football i enjoy all the things about it i enjoy being with the kids
1644296 and theres a commitment here theres a dedication a lot of the kids seem very inspired about what theyre doing
1644297 small numbers are always going to be an issue but that doesnt bother me when the kids are willing to work and to buy into the system that im bringing in
1644298 i enjoyed that experience and learned a lot we had talked about this position and since pocahontas was closing it sort of worked out for me one thing was closing another was opening up
1644299 theres a lot of different responsibilities coming from an assistants role to a head coaching role that i didnt know about he has made that transition a smooth transition and i appreciate it
1644300 i would say that the experience at pocahontas has probably been the most valuable thing for me
1644301 it isnt like when i came to montcalm i was expecting the first day i was going to see 45 kids out here i knew the numbers
1644302 i learned at pocahontas that if you sit around waiting for more kids to come out youre wasting time you have to work with the kids you have and make them better because those are the kids who are going to be with you throughout the year
1644303 i dont mind the small numbers as long as those that you have are willing to work
1644304 coach havens was a great coach we were very excited showing up knowing that we had a good coach taking over coach havens spot were hoping for a winning season this year
1644305 i dont mind it its not going to hurt you
1644306 the purpose of the survey was to gain a better understanding of what nurses go through to get feedback and to make packaging better and easier for end users
1644307 during a procedure a single sterile barrier package is acceptable as long as it maintains device sterility
1644308 to stop using cheap material on the outer packaging most of the products arriving on the dock today are falling apart before they begin to reach the end user
1644309 these kids theyve never died through the whole year we get behind we come back we take the lead we come back and everything
1644310 i have to give all the credit right now to bernardo
1644311 with a big walk he started everything with two outs he wasnt rushing hitting he was patient hitting he took the walk and i have to say he was outstanding with that at bat
1644312 the whole thing about it is hes having a good season so far
1644313 he has been swinging the bat and everything tonight he was kind of rolling over a little bit but my hitting instructor talked to him during the game and told him a few things
1644314 the mercer cup was nice to win because the fans over here deserve it and everything
1644315 we feel comfortable were playing a lot better were doing the little things and everything and i give all the credit to the players theyre really playing hard and busting their butt and i have to give all the credit to them
1644316 when i was a young golfer i really focused on establishing a handicap low enough to get into the tournament which was called the daily telegraph area championship in those days
1644317 i started competing here in the mid 1970s and i have served in an administrative capacity since 1992 when the bank became a co sponsor of the tournament
1644318 i helped former pocahontas tournament director ron satterfield with the behind the scenes work things like tee times trophies tee prizes etc
1644319 i had been the corresponding secretary for the pocahontas for several years and after dr rob jones took over i helped him for the past few years
1644320 when rob expressed a desire to change his role within the tournament i agreed to become the director
1644321 for example i was tied with todd satterfield for the lead going into the final round in 1982 we were both seven over par after 36 holes last year the leader after two rounds was six under thats a 13 shot difference
1644322 i recall that in 2001 when i was caddying for kirk satterfield i got to see that years pocahontas champion brendon dejonge when he shot a 60 thats the course record and i witnessed every shot
1644323 kirk finished the round at two under for the day and lost eight strokes to the lead
1644324 in 2004 seven time pocahontas champion todd satterfield shot a 63 on sunday and came from 11 strokes back to win
1644325 during that round he played the 10th 11th and 12th holes in four under and took complete control that was an amazing stretch of golf
1644326 i remember mr shott sitting in a golf cart to the left of the 18th green every year
1644327 he would make it a point to speak to each golfer at the end of their round on sunday
1644328 first century bank is committed to the future success of the community
1644329 by sponsoring this tournament we help to showcase the beauty of the area and this wonderful course additionally the bank promotes ideals integrity dignity and sportsmanship that are embodied by the game of golf
1644330 it will be firm and fast but with no u s open rough we want each competitor to enjoy the rewards of playing well and playing intelligently
1644331 in the spring it seemed like i had the same role as usual so im excited to keep the same role i had
1644332 the diversity of our offense will depend on the personnel we use
1644333 this summer we had a lot of seven on seven passing drills so that got us better acclimated to the program
1644334 i didnt run no huddle in high school but we ran a lot of one back two back stuff in high school
1644335 it was confusing at first but everybody made their adjustments were getting into it and getting to know everything so were getting a lot better
1644336 all it takes is for us to learn the plays so far everything is good

1644338 this is not a democratic issue or a republican issue it is an issue that affects all of us i am committed to working with all of my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to resolve the energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to act now
1644339 i think for obama the problem is drilling and is alienating environmental activists for mccain the problem is alienating anti tax advocates who are already sort of frustrated with him on some level
1644340 we have to drill here and drill now not wait and see whether theres areas to explore not wait and see whether theres a package that needs to be put together but drill here and drill now
1644341 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1644342 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since theres so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1644343 pagrindin vakar lio id ja orientuota kokybi k ir teising
1644344 sen obama has said expanding our nuclear power plants quote doesnt make sense for america unquote
1644345 he also says no to nuclear storage and no to nuclear processing i could not disagree more
1644346 supports safe and secure nuclear energy however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered obama thinks key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
1644347 i saw sen obamas latest attack has to do with oil and campaign contributions
1644348 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it sen obama voted for it people care not only what you say but how you vote

1644354 chichester got in close to the san marino community he ingratiated himself with san marino society he joined all the right clubs
1644355 i met him a few times he came across as a very debonair guy chichester seemed very clever and he had a bit of a brit accent like some new englanders
1644356 it was the talk of the town for a while after the couple and then he disappeared
1644357 she received a message that they were on a secret mission and then a postcard from france
1644358 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
1644359 weve got to keep winning games we dont have that big cushion where we can go out oh well we lost this game weve got to keep pace thats something new for a lot of these guys in here myself included
1644360 he looked like he was starting to feel it he was up four straight pitches that to me is when guys will feel it their next outing more than just the pitch count
1644361 his ball moved all over the place inside and out he looked like the playoff beckett
1644362 like with hitters you get a ball to fall and you feel better about yourself
1644363 the one thing he hasnt done is get frustrated and run into more outs hes been an intelligent base runner he got into situations tonight where he could steal it and he did
1644364 you kind of look around and no ones counting on you to be that guy
1644365 youre just a complementary piece to that puzzle i think there was a little bit of relaxation that goes with that i mean since ive been here ive got two guys on base every second or third time i get up there
1644366 depends on the way you look at it because the center fielder almost caught it
1644367 well take what we can get that was one of the more interesting plays youll ever see im not going to look a gift horse in the mouth
1644368 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1644369 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1644370 i skate around in skates and tights its not that big a deal
1644371 from the 40 000 i donated we raised over a million
1644372 i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1644373 despite the complexities of the fighting thats going on between the rebels and the government there are 2 1 2 million men women and children who have been driven from their homes by a government that doesnt want them there the un needs to get peacekeepers into the area there should be 26 000 troops in there
1644374 athletes should have the right to say there are things in this world that are not right and we need to address them
1644375 one of them is darfur and china is the host country and its keeping those people from fulfilling their dreams theres potential olympians there
1644376 im not stunned that a non democratic government that doesnt endorse individual rights would be heavy handed
1644377 now we look at china it seems like theyre clamping down more and more and more in every single regard
1644378 everyones so desperate to do business in china that nobodys calling them on it
1644379 china has great economic ties with sudan so they back the sudanese
1644380 they dont really care what happens it seems like to the people in darfur
1644381 peace in darfur would be a much more huge accomplishment infinitely more satisfying
1644382 as soon as i put my skates on i thought this is what i want to do
1644383 when i was 15 i watched the 1994 lillehammer olympics and saw norways speedskater johann koss win three gold medals
1644384 youd have the worst insomnia because youd be worrying about am i going to be able to skate the same times i skated yesterday
1644385 i skated the best 1 000 meters ive ever skated and got the bronze
1644386 it is of course fantastic and a big relief but the biggest realization i had was basically that i had just pushed myself to manic depression and had been miserable and then when i did it i looked around and thought this is it the sun rises the same way and i still had to train seven hours a day
1644387 i realized you have a real shot to do something and not just win a medal and feel good about yourself
1644388 i decided next time not to do just a puppies and ice cream interview
1644389 so much of the news in the us is absolute garbage
1644390 its easy to say im not going to watch anything serious ill watch this garbage on britney spears
1644391 i dont blame the media as much as i blame ourselves if thats all you know it erodes a lot of what makes this country as great as it is
1644392 do i think its wrong that britney spears got 10 million more minutes of air time than 300 000 people in africa getting slaughtered yeah i think its bad but i try to focus on what i can do
1644393 as an american citizen if things get rough i can always pack up and go somewhere else
1644394 what infuriates me though is when you see people willfully supporting the dictator that enables this or giving the arms to one group of poor people so they can slaughter another slightly poorer group of poor people that infuriates me
1644395 olympic committees in the united kingdom belgium or new zealand countries that enjoy the same freedoms that we do tell you its not our place to be talking about this thats someone elses issue and no one else is solving it that infuriates me
1644396 it is great that mr cheeks voice is raising awareness especially at this time
1644397 the situation in darfur has cried out for international attention for years the suffering continues and still requires human intervention and protection for millions of civilians who are displaced
1644398 it is our hope that more athletes use the platform to shine the spotlight on human rights china needs to be pressed on their involvement in sudan
1644399 but not a lot of people are attacking the idea that these 2 million people need protection they may want me to go away but you cant assail the fact that these people need our help
1644400 jis nepaprastas jis geriausias mano draugas ne sivaizduoju be jo gyvenimo sutik s tau skirt mog i karto tai supranti a supratau
1644401 while its clear there is benefit to a significant number of men its equally clear that many men end up being diagnosed and treated for cancers that would likely not have caused them any significant harm
1644402 we talked about everything that has happened since this whole process started
1644403 we rehashed all the different things thats gone on we agreed and disagreed our whole focus was was he a member of our football team and where was his mind at he was not at the proper mindset to be part of our football team
1644404 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1644405 i understand the attention he gets for being in his position i think that he has the tools mentally physically emotionally whos had better training than aaron rodgers in being an nfl qb i believe in aaron because hes very talented
1644406 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1644407 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1644408 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1644409 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1644410 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1644411 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1644412 everything went kind of sour a few weeks or a month back but you never felt like it would get to the point or to the talks of him actually being traded
1644413 i felt once he stepped back in here he would be the quarterback him not being here today i guess management has a different route so at that point weve got to go out and do our job
1644414 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1644415 i am not a racist ive never made a racist comment and i didnt attack obama personally
1644416 played the race card and played it from the bottom of the deck
1644417 the mets have made willie randolph a martyr in this city
1644418 by mapping the different air flows and solar direction across the site we were able to position different sized windows accordingly minimizing heat loss in the winter and heat gain in the summer
1644419 some of thats just a carry over from last season cause we had a pretty good season last year
1644420 and some of its the fact that we know weve got a lot of new girls coming in this year
1644421 yeah im always excited were always excited when the season starts and just happy to be out here
1644422 i think most years youre happy to have a several month layoff
1644423 we were ready to go in november last year it seems like its been a long winter and were ready to go and some of the girls weve talked to feel the same way
1644424 most of our girls play other sports whether its running track tennis
1644425 i know a few of them have gone to camp and there was an indoor program that some of the girls participated in also
1644426 we started yesterday in the middle of the day the hottest time of the day
1644427 no complaints about the weather or anything they just jumped out there and went at it
1644428 were seeing a handful of upperclassmen who didnt play last year whove decided i guess that their interest in soccer has been renewed
1644429 and we know some of that is based on the success we had last year
1644430 last years team we were blessed with an abundance of not just skill and athletic ability but leadership and just a lot of characteristics like that
1644431 the few returning players that we do have know that there is kind of a burden on them that were going to look to them to provide that
1644432 this year because of the number of new players that we have theres a pretty wide range from our top player to the least experienced player
1644433 so were probably going to do a little bit more work on fundamentals this year than we have in the past
1644434 well evaluate this season the same way that we do with every other season
1644435 are the girls making good decisions and are they practicing hard and are they playing hard every time out
1644436 thats how we evaluate every season and this season will be no different
1644437 the development of the situation in zimbabwe until now has not exceeded the context of domestic affairs
1644438 it is not truly democratic that less than a million people can decide the fate of almost half a billion europeans
1644439 we think it is a real cheek that the country that has benefited most from the eu should do this there is no other europe than this treaty
1644440 now is the time for a courageous choice by those who want coherent progress in building europe leaving out those who despite solemn signed pledges threaten to block it
1644441 now that they have used the accession and structural funds when they developed enormously im a little surprised that the solidarity is at an end
1644442 you should know each other and you should report strange people and strange activities
1644443 obama arrives in berlin faces large anti democratic party protest
1644444 seoul reuters u s president george w bush arrived in south korea on tuesday for talks focused on communist north korea and was greeted by a minor protest aimed mostly at his host instead of a big anti u s rally that had been expected in a surprise boost for bush who has largely managed to set aside prickly issues with seoul it was a rally in the city centre in support of what is likely to be his last visit to east asia as president that ended up attracting a huge crowd

1644447 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
1644448 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you

1644467 weve had an amazing response to the recent launch of quarkxpress 8 at drupa in germany and from the customers and media around the world
1644468 now with its easy support for global publishing and quarkxpress 8 being the first ever simultaneous global release of quarkxpress a global tour was an obvious choice
1644469 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules

1644482 by obstructing these compromise proposals to investigate unsolved civil rights crimes and protect children without borrowing more money the senate leadership is denying justice to victims of the past present and future generations it is also sending a message that congress defiantly refuses to live within its means and will not even consider paying for new spending by cutting wasteful washington spending what we have seen this week is a cynical ploy from democratic leaders to use victims of crime diseases and other calamities as props in a partisan political campaign these tactics have embarrassed and discredited the senate and helped reinforce its nine percent approval rating
1644483 the decision by senate democratic leaders to obstruct a compromise supported by alvin sykes the president of the emmett till justice campaign and senator dodd the sponsor of the bill is deplorable and indefensible the emmett till compromise would simply require senate democratic leaders to acknowledge that congress should live within its means like every american family the compromise would require the department of justice to prioritize existing funds in order to fund this effort this step was necessary because senate democratic leaders had no intention to fund this program this year even as they accused me of obstruction and harboring other base motives
1644484 there is no reason for democratic leaders to insist that these bills pass only in the context of their so called tomnibus bill that was soundly rejected and viewed as an exercise in demagoguery and mindless partisanship democratic leaders can now explain why they have drawn a moral equivalence between victims of civil rights crimes and online predators on one side and botanical gardens and war of 1812 commemorations on the other side senators were elected to set priorities and no normal person would say these causes deserve equal attention
1644485 senate democratic leaders also objected last night to legislation designed to protect children from online pornography and exploitation their only basis for objecting was their insistence that this legislation can only pass in a package that also includes legislation regulating the interstate commerce of non human primates
1644486 dont know about you but right about now im counting my blessings sure glad we live in america

1644497 the preparation of this comprehensive plan was completed by mccpp as per the initial contract
1644498 the firm was then hired to execute this plan for the bic under additional contract terms as the general partner of the bahrain centre of excellence
1644499 as time moved on and mccpp continued to develop the agreed plan many of the contract parameters caused delays and funding was not made available per the timelines

1644520 this is an entirely new finding it is a novel antibody that appears to be very effective in killing the hiv virus the main question now is if this can be applied to developing a vaccine and possibly used as a microbicide to prevent sexual transmission
1644521 moreover im troubled by our historical heavy focus on hiv aids while ignoring things that kill far more such as prostate cancer
1644522 prostate cancer kills more than aids quite i never said that never implied that went out of my way to do the reverse
1644523 back to the article you push for as i understand it this does not yet point to any certainty for a preventative vaccine for hiv it is potentially a powerful treatment for aids and one that may lead to a vaccine
1644524 the first step on the way to a potential preventative vaccine for hiv aids
1644525 national or any one of dozens of oft violent nationalist movements around the world these are frequently anti semitic and racist groupings so im not sure id choose to tie my flag to that mast
1644526 thinking back the leader of the separatist nationalist party and premier of the province roughly analogous to an american governor premier jacques parizeau forcefully proclaimed in angry tones on live television after a narrow loss in 1995 that
1644527 it was the first place in the british empire to give full rights of citizenship to jews
1644528 quebec was one of the more anti semitic places going outside of europe during the second world war
1644529 jews were forced to attend protestant schools until 1998 1998 catholics were of course free to attend schools of their own faith yet more tolerance
1644530 yes quebec separatism was so friendly to the jews that tens of thousands of them fled the province with the rise of separatism toronto displaced montreal as having canadas largest jewish population the best tolerance of all loved so well they left
1644531 the above is ethnic cleansing its not a harsh ethnic cleansing with guns though its not without violence in a generation areas went from being 10 20 french to being 90 french
1644532 thats a staggering demographic change and rarely occurs in areas genuinely at social and ethnic peace
1644533 i dont think anyone but a fool would argue that quebec was at social and ethnic peace in the 60s to the 90s
1644534 the first media market where gm chose a black man as its spokesperson with respect thats pretty thin beer is it even true i am highly skeptical
1644535 ill simply note from direct experience that the treatment of blacks in large quebec cities in the 1980s was on a par with anywhere else the treatment of blacks in small francophone towns was amongst the worst ive seen outside of parts of the deep south a treatment not matched by northern us towns or english canadian small towns
1644536 granted most of my friends are apolitical or adq types who view both the liberals and the pq as tired dinosaurs but they know a hawk from a handsaw
1644537 moreover it takes a truly staggering degree of arrogance to come on and spread utter disinformation spinning quebecs relationship with jews as you have and accuse someone who simply writes out the truth as

1644641 tosh so good to see you i want you to meet ellen westerfield
1644642 i got to observe you in the preliminaries and you were wonderful
1644643 you talking to the president of the pilates method allegiance
1644644 and when ellen found out you werent a member yet she said she just had to meet you
1644645 we are a non profit organization that sets standards to protect the public we need to raise critical funds to establish credibility and ensure consumer safety
1644646 its just some of the people coming into the industry dont have any we make it our business to protect the purity of pilates
1644647 we believe the pilates method should evolve in accordance with current scientific research and bio mechanical principles dont you
1644648 we clarify what pilates was what it is today and where its going tomorrow
1644649 that seems like a big job but i guess somebody should be doing it
1644650 you get the honor and prestige of belonging to an organization whos mission is to protect the public and to keep the method pure
1644651 you set yourself apart from those who arent safe and often injure their clients and you get to be on our membership roster which will bring you loads of referrals to help you build your business
1644652 ah that requires membership to attend meetings doesnt it isnt that rather elitist and convenient a great way to suppress dissent to only let in those who pay to agree with you
1644653 hi ellen pleased to meet the woman at the top this is my friend honey
1644654 you know i feel its only natural to seek to consolidate and control power prestige and income i just take issue with the validity of your efforts
1644655 what kind of organization is worth belonging to that promotes fear of being left out to gain compliance and acceptance
1644656 of course i dont mean you ellen but the founder of your organization who came from nowhere picked up someone elses dream and said he would lead for the good of all yet keep control for himself isnt that how this allegiance started the altruistic dream of a long time teacher becomes an opportunists avenue for power prestige and control what was his name kevin bacon
1644657 and the organization has come a long way from its beginnings
1644658 but how far can an organization deviate from its mission and the means to achieve it
1644659 your organization wants me to care more about who they are in the pilates world rather than what anybody can learn about pilates directly from the creator himself you want me to care more about the messengers than the message the fact that somebody you know knew joe once upon a time means more than an understanding of what joe was so passionate about right
1644660 sure they want you a new comer to the pilates world to pay dues so a few members of the aristocracy can secure their prestige power and income at your expense by setting standards that limit what you can teach
1644661 you want me to join a union slash cartel that does not hold pilates as an idea open and available to everyone and anyone how does that benefit anyone except those in control of setting the standards which ignore the ideal nature of pilates in the first place
1644662 this is an example of selling fear to protect income and prestige and asking all the new comers to contribute money to make a set of rules that puts someone else in a position of authority and dictatorship over what and how they teach the method now thats an allegiance
1644663 we are not a trade union or a cartel we are a non profit
1644664 non profit only means you dont care about money probably got too much of that already so whats left the prestige of control
1644665 when i find i need it ill join but doctors belong to organizations and lawyers belong to organizations just because they belong doesnt mean i would trust them
1644666 maybe you should join if youre looking or needing to belong to a group
1644667 but i dont want to support any organization that fails to admit pilates is an idea and seeks to limit my creativity in teaching
1644668 maybe so but ive never known anybody that has belonged ever saying they picked up clients from their association it only gives them a superficial reason to say that they are better than the other guys down the road
1644669 right now im so busy with clients i cant handle any more business and nobody has come up to me and said why arent you a member of so and so or certified by so and so when that becomes and issue when i let fear run my life ill consider joining
1644670 ill do what i want maybe you should do what you think you should do
1644671 on a cout lalbum on la beaucoup aim a tombe bien car on aurait t embarrass du contraire

1644675 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1644676 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1644677 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1644678 i know a great place a couple blocks away i will make a reservation for three
1644679 at the moment the commercial networks arent offering us the right carrots
1644680 weve been offered money weve been offered better conditions but im yet to be offered an affair with kerri anne kennerley
1644681 when they start offering the real stuff then well start thinking of going but until then theyre just not trying
1644682 wed really like to have a show that doesnt involve us working 110 hours a week
1644683 that would be a welcome change apart from that wed like it to be funny
1644684 the only reason we got on tv in the first place was cause there was no one else at the time
1644685 now that theres all these other really really solid comedy acts on tv maybe well have to go to commercial tv where theres no quality whatsoever
1644686 we certainly didnt think a wed end up spending 11 hours in jail for it and b wed have a court case that would end up going for almost a year and c wed still be asked about it a year later
1644687 i think maybe sonny might not have that long in the game with the injuries he had maybe he thinks he does not have much longer in the game and needs to get out of it what he can
1644688 its getting to the point where its getting quite embarrassing
1644689 we need to show plenty of heart this week and get some pride back in the jersey because at the moment were just embarrassing ourselves and the club
1644690 you can come up with thousands of excuses about why were going bad but at the end of the day theres not one player thats going to stop us from getting 40 points put past us
1644691 once we get behind on the scoreboard the heads are just going down at the moment and the excuses come out so weve just spoken about getting rid of that and turning things around
1644692 weve been saying that every week but weve got to do it now
1644693 once upon a time there was a prostitute called maria
1644694 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1644695 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1644696 they passed a man sitting on a bench near dove house road they continued to walk towards arrendene road and as they approached the bridge near waters edge the man walked past them heading towards the town centre
1644697 moments later both girls were grabbed from behind one managed to free herself and alerted police the other was pulled into bushes and was seriously sexually assaulted she pushed the man away and he ran off towards newly built flats
1644698 it is important that we identify and speak to these people as they may hold important information which could assist this inquiry
1644699 even if you arent one of these people if you were using the old railway line between 1pm and 2 30pm on thursday july 24 and havent yet spoken to an officer i would urge you to come forward something you saw that you may feel is insignificant may actually help identify the offender or someone else who may be able to help
1644700 this is a devastating blow for the newmarket community st felix middle school is highly regarded by its pupils and former pupils
1644701 we are urgently looking at the options on how to provide alternative arrangements with as little disruption as possible for the start of term in september
1644702 i was truly devastated sick with worry that the school wouldnt be open again i phoned my best friend and we were crying over the phone about our much loved memories at st felix
1644703 even though the building is dead the school and the pupils wont be
1644704 we have not yet had an approach from suffolk county council but we are happy to discuss the situation with them and help in anyway we can
1644705 listen all the world knows that everton and sevilla are after me
1644706 but i have a contract with rennes and i do understand that rennes want to keep me
1644707 my contract with the club expires in june 2010 however i am staying this year because i have a good relationship with rennes
1644708 next year maybe i will want to further my career but i need to respect rennes they gave me the platform to be who i am
1644709 were familiar with many of the local drivers those we havent seen before get checked with the computer
1644710 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1644711 weve done this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool to whitewash their human rights record on tibet
1644712 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1644713 its absolutely critical that a message is sent to the chinese government to meaningfully address and end violence and repression in tibet or they will never be truly accepted by the international community
1644714 use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1644715 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1644716 supply musicians with the tools they need to make great recordings
1644717 because of the disruption and concern its caused i expect there has been a number of staff who have voted with their feet and left middle schools to look for jobs in neighbouring counties
1644718 it will have been a contributory factor but its difficult to say for sure without a detailed analysis
1644719 it would be interesting to see how schools in the first phase of reorganisation in lowestoft and haverhill had performed however not all schools in suffolk are middle schools it could be that there has been an impact at junior level as well
1644720 as about half our children at key stage 2 will be in middle schools it would be surprising if there wasnt some effect teachers are very concerned for their own jobs and are discouraged by the lack of support from the county council
1644721 as a response to this suffolk is reorganising schools so that all pupils will be taught within a two tier system
1644722 we are seeing the benefits of some good improvements in the teaching of reading which is encouraging to see
1644723 i had been out in the caravan earlier putting stuff in it which i had cleaned after we got home and then put back ready for the next trip
1644724 in a sleepy little place like this where we have lived for 15 years you just do not expect something like that
1644725 we have never had any problems before it was like living in a nightmare we were just in the middle of it all
1644726 in the car park outside my house two of the cars were completely blown up and its affected the others nearby
1644727 mine has been completely destroyed my tyres are ruined and everything inside is melted too
1644728 i woke up at about 3 30am with a sound like a bomb i looked outside and there were big flames everywhere
1644729 the fire service was here within minutes but they couldnt stop the damage and it was 5 30am by the time they left
1644730 i woke up at about 3am and the car was on fire
1644731 oh i dont eat too much i eat just the right amount and work out im very healthy
1644732 and everybody says im skinny but im so not im just this way and im healthy
1644733 the defence secretary has said reports british soldiers delayed helping iraqi troops in basra because of a deal with militiamen were
1644734 it is clear that any deal dependent on a militia as unscrupulous as that controlled by moqtada al sadr was likely to unravel there were too many fighters driven by criminal motives to allow any hope that the accommodation would encourage al mahdi army back into the political process or isolate the extremists instead british troops became party to a clique terrorising the city a fact resented by its residents and by the iraqi government
1644735 the conservatives are being evasive about their funding plans for the arts
1644736 wow ive had that book a long time i should really read it
1644737 its so tempting to slack off in sixth year but id urge people not to and to just go for it because if i can get into cambridge anything can happen
1644738 i was aiming to get four as and a b but was trying to be realistic i was shocked when i saw the five as and thought for a minute it might be someone elses certificate im just really glad that all my hard work paid off
1644739 my secret was to not be daunted by the workload and get through it a bit at a time i hope to do well again this year as i would like to study medicine next year im also looking forward to celebrating with my friends
1644740 i was really pleased when i read the text i was expecting good grades but did better than i thought
1644741 i am aware of the catastrophic effects my actions have had upon others
1644742 i am painfully aware of the devastating loss i have caused for another family to endure i accept i am totally to blame and for that i am sorry
1644743 i consider that it is rather early in the disqualification period to remove it but i do take into account your otherwise good background and particularly have regard to the very powerful terms of the letter from your employers
1644744 taking all the circumstances into account i am persuaded you should have the opportunity to follow this employment
1644745 this wasnt a lunatic driving madly along a road this was a policeman going to his work within the speed limit overtaking and making an error
1644746 driving on the wrong side of the road without being able to see what is coming is courting disaster
1644747 its been a good pre season with just one defeat there have been a lot of positives and very few negatives
1644748 but as much as you try and make pre season games competitive they do not have the same edge as the real thing
1644749 i would far rather drop three points in the league cup than the league what we will do is get the rustiness away for the ashfield game
1644750 the games will be competitive though and we want to go and play well by the time ashfield comes around we will be ready
1644751 its very difficult right now to pick a team and at the moment we dont know what our best line up will be a lot of players have played their way into contention and its now 50 50 in some positions
1644752 we have a squad of 23 players and thats a big squad but these are the decisions willie and i have got to make were absolutely delighted with the squad
1644753 this format got me a job 20 years ago what could be wrong with it now
1644754 cc 3 0 in the footer and style css wonder what their reaction will be
1644755 i have found out there aint no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them
1644756 our first games not until saturday so its the perfect chance for us to take advantage of the opportunity of a night off and see what were up against
1644757 it means weve got an idea how the others will set their stall out
1644758 he will be an important part of the team with myself tam and stewart so well be splitting up to watch the opposition
1644759 playing east kilbride away will be a totally different game than it would be from playing at home with a bigger pitch so we will adjust our game plan accordingly
1644760 ive a lot of great memories from my time at east kilbride thistle and still have a lot of friends there on the committee and playing staff
1644761 i know their management team colin mitchell and ian penman who are two nice lads and have a lot of time for the committee and the club there
1644762 i always wish them all the very best apart from when they play us of course
1644763 theyve got a lot of good lads whos played for cambuslang or ive had before guys like alan mccrae alan paterson and davie atha who are more friends rather than football colleagues so its a good chance to have a catch up with them too
1644764 it feels great to win the award but if it wasnt for the performances of the rest of the team i dont think i would have won it
1644765 they deserve it as much as i do especially my defenders and the whole team have to take credit for the award and our performance last season
1644766 we are all back in a couple of weeks with some friendly games and then the league starts up again
1644767 we want to win the league again and this time win the scottish cup as well
1644768 obviously its disappointing to be missing the start of the season
1644769 we have never beaten aberdeen before so it would be great to get that monkey off our backs right away and save any hassle
1644770 the aberdeen clash is a big game up here but ill miss out on that one and the following game against hamilton because my red card took me over the points threshold
1644771 i had a spell with dundee united which for various reasons including a new manager coming in it didnt work out for me
1644772 when he craig levein joined he brought some new players in and he didnt take to me but once i got a fresh start with inverness ive been enjoying my football again and playing well
1644773 weve had a good pre season away in denmark where we picked up three draws and it was a good experience getting to play against teams with different styles
1644774 the squad is looking good and we are ready for the new season now
1644775 i think over our last four years in the premier league we have stabilised ourselves and are now a decent spl outfit i dont think aiming for the top six is outwith our capabilities but we need to make a good start to the season and pick up some points
1644776 craig is a very positive person and his attitude rubs off on the other players and he believes we can get a spot in that top six this year
1644777 my aim for the season is to play as regularly as i can and keep as many clean sheets as possible
1644778 but playing against the top teams like celtic and rangers is what you want to be doing
1644779 in my absence theyve had the chance to assess the players and theres three or four who i was thinking werent good enough but have proved to be more than adequate and some who i thought were good enough but havent shown it
1644780 im delighted with the way things have gone for sure and all credit to them theyve had some decent performances and one bad one over the piece
1644781 we went down to kilbirnie without nine players whod be strong contenders for the starting line up for the first game of the season
1644782 we were unfortunate with holidays weddings injuries and whatever and were without but weve got to take the plus from the game in that it shows us how far weve got to go
1644783 im not too disappointed about it you never want to lose a game 5 0 but in the second half our entire back four was missing and we brought in players from different angles pulling players back from midfield to defence and so on
1644784 we also had guys who had just come back from holiday and this was their first game back so im not too broken hearted by it
1644785 but youve got to remember kilbirnie beat pollok 5 1 in a cup final six weeks ago so theyre not a bad side
1644786 pre season games are great for a certain measure of how far weve come but its very different when it comes to competitive games
1644787 sometimes it can be hard to build guys up for a pre season friendly against with all due respect to them amateur teams especially if theyve just got in from work on a monday night
1644788 its not the kind of game that whets your appetite so weve got to do the best we can to get them up for it
1644789 ive always been totally against trail bikes and i have continually told declan that under no circumstances is he to go near them
1644790 im absolutely delighted that hes going to be okay in the end but im very angry with him as well for not doing what hes told
1644791 these bikes are a big problem in pather because theyre very popular with a lot of kids the police are always chasing them for being on the bikes but it doesnt seem to put them off
1644792 hopefully declans accident will deter mums and dads buying these bikes as toys because they most certainly arent the speeds they go at make them very dangerous and declans accident could have been a lot worse
1644793 declan has learned his lesson and he has promised never to go on a motorbike again he thought itd just be a quick bit of fun but because of the accident he isnt even able to ride his own bicycle during the rest of the summer holidays
1644794 one good thing that has come out of the whole thing already is that the family of the girl who owned the bike declan crashed are getting rid of it and a couple of friends who were thinking of getting trail bikes for their kids have said that they definitely wont now
1644795 its just crazy that some parents are spending up to 2000 on something thats so dangerous and inappropriate for their children if one child is deterred from wanting a trail bike after seeing how declan has ended up it will have been worthwhile
1644796 a young boy has suffered serious injuries which not only affects him but his family and it is tragic under the circumstances
1644797 we must reiterate these machines are not toys this is an example of what can happen if these vehicles are used in such circumstances
1644798 to be fit for use on the road they must be legally taxed insured and where applicable have an mot with the most relevant driving licence
1644799 in lots of situations parents are buying trail bikes and the like for their children and they are not fully aware of the legislation which affects such vehicles
1644800 the use of such vehicles is governed by the road traffic act and if anyone wants any information they can contact their local police office
1644801 such vehicles shouldnt be ridden in public places without the correct documentation
1644802 even if they have the permission of the land owner they are still using them at their own risk
1644803 strathclyde police actively encourages the safe use and responsible supervision of young children on such machines
1644804 in recent years there have been a number of deaths and serious injuries to the riders of such machines and complacency should never be adopted as to the danger of using them without the necessary equipment and safety checks having been properly carried out
1644805 children should be supervised at all times when such machines are being used by them
1644806 many people locally myself included will have been pleased to hear the commitment of the council leader to actively looking at all the options to keep the mill street branch open a result which we all want to see
1644807 i have had discussions with steven purcell the leader of glasgow city council who has told me of his plans to keep post offices open in glasgow including financial support from the council
1644808 residents locally will be aware that organisational change particularly when taxpayers money is involved is sometimes a necessary part of public life in much the same way that the council itself has had to take difficult decisions for example on the schools modernisation programme which involved the closure of earnock high school in hamilton
1644809 on the case of the recent post office announcement i do not believe that royal mail have made the case for closure at the mill street branch a view which has been reinforced by postwatch who have also highlighted concerns i hope that we can continue to keep a united approach to safeguard the future of this community facility
1644810 i will work along with local mp tommy mcavoy to build a case for the retention of the mill street post office
1644811 postwatch scotland believes that the proposed closure could have a negative impact on quality of service currently being provided
1644812 i am extremely encouraged with the support of the council leader
1644813 the amount of signatures we have gathered shows the strength of feeling in support of retaining the post office
1644814 it is not only vital in terms of post office services but the closure would have major implications to all the other shops there they all provide a local lifeline for those who are not so fit
1644815 the snp are happy to welcome all converts for the fight to save wallace street post office
1644816 i hope south lanarkshire council will join snp msps and councillors to make sure local constituents object to these plans during the consultation period
1644817 we were hoping to speak to as many people as possible so as to try and jog their memories
1644818 its possible that without even realising someone may have seen or heard something that will be of interest to our investigation
1644819 i was pleased with the responce from the public as everyone was very co operative and understood the importance of the exercise
1644820 we are currently sifting through the information we gathered to see what we are able to find
1644821 in the meantime i would appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the disturbance take place or anyone with information that may assist police enquiries to contact the incident room at london road police office
1644822 the notion that there is something called black america is a subject of debate
1644823 a black mother from cuba and a white father from australia
1644824 dude ive been reading these since 14 in the first series
1644825 john was born in 1962 and i was born in 1964 i moved to east kilbride as a baby and we were both around when it was a brand new and rapidly expanding town
1644826 east kilbride is not new any more and that is why slc is investing millions in its infrastructure with new high schools new primary schools new care facilities new sports centres investment in our roads and the extra investment planned for the town centre and elsewhere
1644827 so i would issue an invite to john that when he has time he should come up and i will give him a personal tour of the town where he can see for himself where the investments are being made and i will explain to him the plans we have for the future
1644828 i think the idea of the money that was wasted on it when you look at some of the social and economic destitution that people are living in
1644829 im from east kilbride and i have been up there a few times in the last month
1644830 culturally theres not really that much going on it seems to me theres not much for young people to do but drink i just think did we really need another level of bureaucracy
1644831 rabbie burns wrote a great poem about politicians such a parcel of rogues in a nation its not changed
1644832 whether theyre scottish or whether theyre in westminster theyre all wearing the same grey suits and theyre all promoting themselves what it seems to me theyre doing is actually protecting their own careers rather than doing any good
1644833 east kilbride is great if you have kids that whole lifestyle is very seductive
1644834 you get a job get married then you have kids and you think
1644835 but for people who want to do something else theres nothing there so you have to move away even to glasgow culturally theyre worlds apart
1644836 admittedly east kilbride is not perfect but its a lot better than a lot of places
1644837 we should be proud of our town and maybe the
1644838 john is not the first to do this and im just grateful that others from east kilbride such as ally mccoist have seen fit to put something back into their hometown and be proud of it
1644839 we are unable to pursue this incident further as the victim does not want to press charges it is always frustrating when people who have clearly been the victim of an assault decide not to press charges but its something we have to deal with
1644840 there were all sorts of rumours flying around about what had happened some people thought there had been a murder
1644841 its very very dangerous to cross there and we dont want them to wait until someone is killed before they decide to do something
1644842 this isnt the first time we have complained about this section of road and a lot of woman have been complaining about it recently
1644843 i had to help a man across just the other day
1644844 ill take the petition to the appropriate department and ask them to do a traffic impact study
1644845 during school hours there is a lollipop man here but hopefully there us a chance of getting the crossing
1644846 in light of the concerns raised by parents we will be carrying out a survey when the schools return after the summer holidays
1644847 i have found out there aint no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them
1644848 dude ive been reading these since 14 in the first series
1644849 blogs will be sub labels because they can generate music
1644850 entertainment is a more zen thing no you dont need to have anything we live in such small spaces you dont have room to store 1 000 records if you want to hear a crappy gwen stefani song you can hear it and not keep it
1644851 dude ive been reading these since 14 in the first series
1644852 are you taking the boys with you to the store
1644853 are you willing to start up a movie for the girls
1644854 dude ive been reading these since 14 in the first series

1644860 children in the back seat lower suspicion we let it move through
1644861 they parked the vehicle the adults run out and detonate it with the children in the back
1644862 the brutality and ruthless nature of this enemy hasnt changed
1644863 i do not want to know its those lesbian things again
1644864 i got the ball and ran at one of their big defensive lineman but after the tackle he kind of just jumped on me and it just snapped my collarbone
1644865 school was always important to me and it was pretty tough doing all those courses in that little of time
1644866 when i decided i wanted to further my education i figured i would try and play again prove myself again
1644867 it will be nice for my family to not have to drive so far to watch me play
1644868 but they have always been supportive and even went to games in moscow
1644869 i still have my brother and some friends on the team so it will be different going against them
1644870 i left on good terms with everyone and i had some good times up there as well
1644871 from what i have seen so far and what i know about idaho we are almost identical at every position it should be a good one and im sure ill hear some boos
1644872 i am willing to do whatever to help the team and prove myself
1644873 allora giovanotto dimmi qual la cosa a cui tieni di pi

1644879 chiunque si pone come arbitro in materia di conoscenza destinato a naufragare nella risata degli dei
1644880 la cosa pi bella che possiamo sperimentare il mistero la fonte di ogni vera arte e di ogni vera scienza
1644881 chi non ammette linsondabile mistero non pu essere neanche uno scienziato
1644882 se almeno fossi in grado di spiegare in che modo funziona lomeopatia
1644883 allora dovrei affermare che ho ragione perch tengo pi fantasia di loro
1644884 si potrebbe dire che leterno mistero del mondo sia la sua comprensibilit
1644885 sono sicuro che questo bambino ha un grande futuro davanti a s
1644886 domani parler combatter per le mie idee mi mettano pure alla berlina per i secoli a venire io sosterr sempre lomeopatia
1644887 sait maintenant parfaitement ce qui fonctionne et quil le fait bien
1644888 clearly too many have used freedom of the press as a weapon not only to strangle our free speech but to erode and ultimately destroy the right to keep and bear arms as well in doing so you promoted your profession to that of constitutional judge and jury more powerful even than our supreme court more prejudiced than the inquisitions tribunals it is a frightening misuse of constitutional privilege and i pray that you will come to your senses and see that these abuses are curbed
1644889 i can hear the shocked indignation of gun toters already its nobodys business but mine if i want to pack heat au contraire because the government handles the permitting it is everyones business
1644890 a state that eagerly puts sex offender data online complete with an interactive map could easily do the same with gun permits but it does not
1644891 as a sunshine week gift the roanoke times has placed the entire database mistakes and all emphasis added online at you can search to find out if neighbors carpool partners elected officials or anyone else has permission to carry a gun
1644892 did we make it easier to obtain the information yes but its still a public record
1644893 the odor ripened when bloomberg filed civil lawsuits against these gun shops rather than turn over evidence to the proper authorities for criminal prosecution bloombergs office refused to turn over that evidence and instead the billionaire mayor launched a high profile media campaign demonizing the targeted gun shop operators
1644894 the alternative is an open ended bleeding of our blood and treasure with no end in sight and no pressure on the iraqi government to make the changes necessary
1644895 i dont ask people to vote on the leaderships behalf particularly on a vote like this
1644896 for people who are undecided and looking for a reason to vote for the supplemental moveon is going to make a difference providing instant cover for these members
1644897 jim clyburn said he was doing an assessment so thats what i was doing now that hes whipping im going to start whipping
1644898 i beg to differ that theres anybody whipping against this bill
1644899 rahm emanuel told us a vote against this bill is a vote to give the republicans victory
1644900 moveon put out a dishonest poll that did not offer its members a real choice to end the war and now the peace movement is lobbying activists to reform moveon or drop off its list
1644901 we were basically declining to take a position as long as we could to strengthen the hand of the progressives we did the poll at the last time we felt we could have an impact on the final vote
1644902 well encourage people to vote for that and for the supplemental
1644903 we are trying to end the war thats the mandate
1644904 dude ive been reading these since 14 in the first series
1644905 unincorporated territories acquired by the united states were not part of the nation for constitutional purposes
1644906 given how the cheapening of citizenship is so much the unnamed battleground in debates over immigration national security and surveillance its telling to see for whom these definitions are enforced to the letter i e the parents of u s citizens and for whom they are bent old guard white male republicans
1644907 dude ive been reading these since 14 in the first series
1644908 the people have a god given right to bear arms
1644909 mir ist es wurscht dass wir gegen brasilien spielen unser ziel ist die goldmedaille daf r m ssen wir jedes spiel gewinnen
1644910 we got down at the people level and are staying
1644911 once the people know we are going to be around then all kinds of things start to happen
1644912 my roe may not be modified with supplemental guidance lower down and ive written a letter to all coalition forces saying your chain of command will stay with you i think that solved the issue
1644913 we will not go along with a partisan fishing expedition aimed at honorable public servants
1644914 testimony should be on the record and under oath thats the formula for true accountability
1644915 fine roll the dice take your chances and call your mommies it will be a long ride and you wil not like it
1644916 in terms of presidential prerogative in terms of preserving confidential communications with your staff yes
1644917 its so difficult to find a pr person at their desks especially in the afternoon
1644918 at the end i think the link does look better over what i am talking above but dont get bored yet this komicwords page will expanded fully into more better content in the future what i need you to do know just

1644928 un intervento di alto profilo mica una volgare lottizzazione rilancer lintero quartiere circostante di san berillo dar lavoro a sei ottomila addetti fino al 2014 doter la citt di strutture come il nuovo mercato coperto la questura ma il ministero degli interni ne pagher laffitto ndr 37 mila metri quadri di verde pubblico e altrettanti di parcheggio pubblico sotterraneo a due piani e far da volano per il recupero del waterfront lintera catania cambier volto

1644937 a radical racist group one of the most anti american groups in the country which has permeated u s campuses since the 1960s and continues its push to carve a racist nation out of the american west
1644938 the organizations very nomenclature the national council of la raza is hate speech to the core despite all the contortions of the group raza as its latin cognate suggests reflects the meaning of race in spanish not the people and thats precisely why we dont hear of something like the national council of the people which would not confer the buzz notion of ethnic racial and tribal chauvinism
1644939 america seeks a world in which there are no nuclear weapons
1644940 a global ban on the production of fissile material for weapons

1644942 violent crime in the city of chicago is out of control im offering resources of the state to the city to work in a constructive way with mayor daley to do everything we can possibly do to help stop this violence
1644943 it might be able to free up some resources that the chicago police uses for capital needs to be able to maybe to hire more police officers or possibly ask some to come out of retirement to put them into these violent zones hot zones where clearly i think part of the challenge is that gang bangers outnumber police officers five to one

1644950 beer pong is a virtual rendition of the popular college drinking game that requires players to toss ping pong balls across a table and into a cup of beer if your cup is hit you drink
1644951 we never anticipated such a severe reaction to the word beer says jag jaegar co owner of jv games which released pong toss on july 28 with a kid friendly rating of t for teen
1644952 the controversy isnt entirely surprising the point of beer pong is to get your friends drunk and parents and university administrators generally frown on that sort of thing last fall georgetown university banned beer pong specially made beer pong tables and inordinate numbers of ping pong balls and any other alcohol related paraphernalia in its on campus dorms even in the rooms of students of legal drinking age the university of pennsylvania yale university the university of massachusetts at amherst and tufts university have also banned drinking games were pleased that tufts has put this in writing says michelle bowdler a health administrator at the school although we understand that twenty one is the legal drinking age we dont want our students participating in activities that could do excessive harm to themselves or others

1644988 a government that robs peter to pay paul can always depend on the support of paul
1644989 a democracy is nothing more than mob rule where fifty one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty nine
1644990 a wise and frugal government which shall leave men free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labor and bread it has earned this is the sum of good government
1644991 i predict future happiness for americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them
1644992 all tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent
1644993 dependence begets subservience and venality suffocates the germ of virtue and prepares fit tools for the designs of ambition
1644994 it is always better to have no ideas than false ones to believe nothing than to believe what is wrong

1645001 after a rambling free ranging talk about the worsening economy and the price of gas he told us that he would give us all two things to help us get through perilous times
1645002 all of those scripture verses given do talk about the prospering of gods people the idea that this is always referring to physical wealth is patently absurd avanzini and all of his huckster compatriots only use scripture as proof texts for their own ridiculous claims that god wants everyone wearing brioni suits and rolex watches
1645003 he went through several bible references where stones talked in the old testament here avanzini introduces the stone idea he strolled down the aisles his ring winking in the lights and held out a shiny stone for a woman to hold avanzini told the assembled crowd of about 650 people that these stones should be rubbed whenever people faced rising prices or higher prices at the pump the ushers went down the aisles with buckets of shiny smooth stones and handed them out
1645004 his gideons offering of a goat to god was such a sacrifice for someone who lived in a cave
1645005 perhaps the man sensed a few hostile vibes from the audience from our row in particular because he warned us not to let the devil keep us back from getting free from debt by putting a gift for his ministry on our credit card
1645006 avanzini then prayed an igniting prayer over the stones everyone was clutching presumably we still have to ignite our own with a credit card gift but maybe his igniting prayer was considered the first step the entire thing was an unspeakable tragedy these men target the poor in particular because they are the ones desperate enough to need a breakthrough that is the evil in all of this the rich arent stupid enough to give away their cash to the likes of avanzini its the poor and the needy the hurting and the ill who desperately need help who are vulnerable to these sharks
1645007 joel feels our pain and has made himself wealthy reportedly earning 13 million for his last book advance alone and his church prosperous 75 million and counting in annual revenue by urging us to let go of it to turn it over to god to accept gods favor so that we may be as prosperous as joel
1645008 osteen is one of a new breed of televangelists joyce meyer t d jakes and creflo dollar are also rising stars who are preaching a less sanctimonious more inclusive message his church is in that part of the economy that thrives in troubled times that can count on full pews when wallets are empty and an ever more receptive audience if we do go into a full on recession

1645029 we marched all night arrived at franklin tenn in the morning here we halted and built a line of works and we thought as the rebels seemed anxious for a fight that we would try our hand on them at this place so we made all necessary preparations we had cannon placed along our line of works about 50 yards apart besides a number of well fortified forts containing several pieces of artillery at 4 oclock p m the enemy came they drove in our pickets and made a desperate charge upon our works but were driven back with a great slaughter however this did not satisfy them and they came again and again until they had made as much as 8 or 10 different charges upon our works they took a portion of our works at one time but they were immediately retaken by our men they fought with a desperation worthy of a better cause the battle lasted 7 hours we retreated at 11 p m co d had one man killed co e one wounded the enemy loss was reported at 8 or 10 thousand our regt had helped build a great many lines of works during the war but this was the first time that they had the privilege of fighting behind works during a general engagement we retreated to nashville and went into camp at fort negley the enemy followed us but they did not make a charge upon us at nashville as they did at franklin i think that they had got about enough of charging but they halted some distance from the city and built works we remained in camp some 15 days and there was some fighting going on every day during this time

1645070 the color bearer of the thirty third was killed some fifteen paces from the works
1645071 when lieutenant h c shaw of company k carried them forward and when in the act of planting them on the works was killed his body falling in the trench the colors falling in the works
1645072 we marched all night arrived at franklin tenn in the morning here we halted and built a line of works and we thought as the rebels seemed anxious for a fight that we would try our hand on them at this place so we made all necessary preparations we had cannon placed along our line of works about 50 yards apart besides a number of well fortified forts containing several pieces of artillery at 4 oclock p m the enemy came they drove in our pickets and made a desperate charge upon our works but were driven back with a great slaughter however this did not satisfy them and they came again and again until they had made as much as 8 or 10 different charges upon our works they took a portion of our works at one time but they were immediately retaken by our men they fought with a desperation worthy of a better cause the battle lasted 7 hours we retreated at 11 p m co d had one man killed co e one wounded the enemy loss was reported at 8 or 10 thousand our regt had helped build a great many lines of works during the war but this was the first time that they had the privilege of fighting behind works during a general engagement we retreated to nashville and went into camp at fort negley the enemy followed us but they did not make a charge upon us at nashville as they did at franklin i think that they had got about enough of charging but they halted some distance from the city and built works we remained in camp some 15 days and there was some fighting going on every day during this time
1645073 i was in the pentagon on 9 11 and in its aftermath i witnessed the most remarkable and chilling attempt to consolidate and abuse executive power circumvent and ignore the rule of law and reverse engineer due process and the rules of evidence to deny our newest enemies a fair trial
1645074 my primary purpose was to say thank you for the work that youve done to provide additional encouragement and support
1645075 i respect them i appreciate them i want them to be safe in doing their jobs i want them to be respected by the public
1645076 just because a couple people did some really bad things some horrible things some outrageous things the rest of our dhs workers should not be painted with a negative brush
1645077 maybe the language was a little vivid but as a parent and as a city worker and as a worker at dhs i feel the same way
1645078 you want to see the passion from the person in charge under no circumstances should someone die on your watch
1645079 he needs to see us as the professionals we are he needs to see that were risk takers we risk our lives every day we go places where police wont go
1645080 i think hes willing to help us become a better agency i think he knows weve made a lot of strides
1645081 every time a mayor comes in and theres a scandal they say they will fix things
1645082 it wasnt until i was in college that i began dealing with the enormity of what happened and was ready to take on the fight for what was right and just
1645083 my wife carole and i had a 15 minute private meeting with president bush we made a decision that we wanted something to happen
1645084 does it bring us one step closer to what we wanted to accomplish yes do we still want to know all of those who were responsible yes
1645085 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims
1645086 now these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve
1645087 many positive things have been accomplished since 1988 better air security improvements with first responders and support for other families affected by terrorist acts
1645088 but every day i miss my brother and all the positive things dont change that my children will grow up without an uncle
1645089 were coming up on the 20th anniversary and id like the whole thing to be over
1645090 its been grueling and frustrating but weve survived because we have each other to lean on
1645091 is still on the surface and will be with us the rest of our lives
1645092 have been a trial for us to get justice we dont want revenge we want the facts out we want to know why it happened and mete out punishment
1645093 if you play in this country live in this country and you grow up in the heartland and you put on a russian uniform you are not a patriotic person in my mind
1645094 i stopped praying for god to put me on that u s team
1645095 and i just said show me very clearly where you want me to go what you want me to do open doors shut doors ill go whichever way you open
1645096 it was in my contract to say would you agree if such and such plays out you would play for our national team it wasnt until december or january of this year that i started seriously thinking about it
1645097 rather than starting with a core and working our way out we decided wed start with a larger national team be as inclusive as possible because of everyones overseas commitments then select the team closer to olympic time
1645098 our position is that she has every right to do exactly what she did
1645099 in her opinion she didnt have a shot to make our team so she went with the russian contract not every player was offered that opportunity i know it was a difficult decision for her
1645100 i wish i had the opportunity i wish i had been given the opportunity will you come play with us from usa basketball and russia saying well pay you 20 million to play for us and watch what decision i would have made watch i would have loved to have been given that opportunity that would just settle any money any patriotic dispute

1645106 he just had an ignorant attitude but i never talked to him i just knew him by seeing him
1645107 i dont understand why he did what he did he saw my son i know he saw my son
1645108 i lay there staring at my kids all damn night long its messed up to say but i was just thankful i knew where everybody was and everybody was ok
1645109 she didnt want to be here from the beginning but she didnt have a choice for her pocketbook
1645110 they call it the daddy race they see people wearing the shirt and it makes them and me very proud

1645112 charlottesville has grown a lot and its population has changed
1645113 there were distribution problems before so were doing this to better serve the community
1645114 the principal route serving students was a long 120 minute route
1645115 i was riding the blue route and then it changed into the orange route i was lost and confused what happened
1645116 we want to provide more complete transportation options for students staff and faculty
1645117 if i had known that they were going to pay to have a bus i might have actually lived there
1645118 i didnt want to drive anywhere theres nowhere to park and gas is expensive

1645127 for all the stage door excitement and box office success this is not the greatest dane
1645128 some parts of the role particularly the manlier more noble elements are underplayed mr tennant is also upstaged by a deliciously subtle turn from patrick stewart as the wicked but practical king claudius

1645155 i take responsibility for my being involved in this relationship and i regret the hurt caused to anyone including my family

1645190 she and i have been asked that question a thousand times and we are sorry that we dont have any funny stories to tell you about it
1645191 we have reviewed 500 of those to date we have not found a similar problem in those cases
1645192 its obviously an embarrassment and we would rather not be in this position
1645193 only this morning we concluded testing and have got to the stage where we are satisfied we cant rely on dna evidence in this case
1645194 we have very sophisticated systems in place to guard against cross contamination in the laboratory the evidence is they work 99 99 per cent of the time here the 01 per cent has slipped through and been picked up
1645195 we have refined the process to ensure the 01 is picked up before the information is released and passed to the public
1645196 this is human error we have systems because humans arent fool proof and occasionally make mistakes but the system picked that up and the public can and should have confidence in the integrity of the dna testing processes in place

1645205 you dont have those connection fees you arent paying anything to the utility company for waste treatment facilities youre doing it all
1645206 we dont want to get something thats so experimental that in four five years it breaks down and we have a big embarrassment
1645207 we wanted to combine the best of both worlds the best of this ancient philosophy of architecture where the whole idea is to bring its inhabitants into alignment with natural law
1645208 but thats also what the modern environmental movement wants it to be its all about natural law theres a nice convergence there from sort of two different angles from the east and the west so to speak from ancient to modern
1645209 theyre looking at a mostly eastern oriented building and from an energy standpoint a solar energy standpoint we want to basically have our collection area facing south
1645210 so theres an east and south orientation issue that had to be worked out theyre very sensitive to try and bring in that east light and were trying to also bring in that south light

1645257 scientists have wondered for a long time why madness and creativity seem linked
1645258 it appears likely that low levels of latent inhibition and exceptional flexibility in thought might predispose to mental illness under some conditions and to creative accomplishment under others

1645260 it appears that we have not only identified one of the biological bases of creativity but have moved towards cracking an age old mystery the relationship between genius madness and the doors of perception

1645278 in 18 aug 2007 the mareva department of interpol has blocked our servers and websites and locked them all and also all our mirror websites and brought our case to an international court without any document against us just as we were the best hy high yielding paying on internet while we have over 580 000 investors worldwide in 200 countries
1645279 the fsc has been receiving calls from the public requesting assistance in gaining access to swiss cash
1645280 callers report that they are unable to gain access to the entitys website to check on their investment
1645281 but they have blocked access to our websites so most of our investors would imagine that we are scammers and disappeared from web and got all their money with us
1645282 we set an criterion for the air quality of qingdao olympic sailing events according to that of the sydney olympics and qingdao has already set up 23 automatic environmental monitoring sub centres in its urban area three of which are working around the olympic sailing venue
1645283 the centre collects real time data from the subcenters every an hour and finally makes a daily assessment of the citys air condition
1645284 august is always the clearest month of qingdao throughout the year so air quality would be out of question during the olympics
1645285 we sample and examine the water once every day the frequency is much higher than the international standard of once half a month
1645286 we are completely confident that the water quality will meet or even surpass the requirement during august
1645287 we have made a commitment to reach our target of 4 000 police officers by the end of 2009
1645288 we will reach this target not only in numbers but in the quality of training as well
1645289 your job is unlike any other job yours is a calling not just because you were looking for work it is a lifelong dedication

1645292 the economic bilateral took place within the context of south africas priority to consolidate bilateral political economic and trade relations with namibia with a view to advancing the african agenda

1645300 o homem nao morre quando ele deixa de existir ele s morre quando deixa de sonhar
1645301 one of the things that i sort of learned in the first season was that we called season one volume one and it was entitled genesis
1645302 it just happened to be twenty three episodes long volume ii is entitled generations and it by no means has to be an entire season long i wouldnt expect it to be an entire season long in fact were looking at that volume to end in the middle of the season which allows us to wrap up certain stories and allows us to have new stories begin so you dont get a sense that if you jump on the train that youre aggressively being pushed off of the train because you dont know whats going on thats a big concern with us
1645303 the idea is actually to do smaller finales so that we dont have to carry the burden of having every single character come together to do this great thing well build to certain mysteries that feel like they need to be solved and things will be solved and other ones will kind of straggle along as with many volumes of books and comic books
1645304 no no no everybody still gets woven in its just that the cliffhanger aspect or the finale aspect may not involve them as much as some of the other people
1645305 the premiere is an episode entitled four months later and so we pick up the stories four months after we left off at the end of the season there is tremendous mystery in what happened during those four months and thats part of why youre watching these first few episodes theyre revealing what actually happened so the recap in a way is sort of built into the story
1645306 a lot of it was planned for and felt fairly natural its a big cast one of the things we are doing this year because were not asking the audience to start absolutely from scratch were not so concerned now about every episode having every single character in it so were able to sort of pull back and ebb and flow and let certain characters come to the surface for an episode and sit out an episode the idea of being able to focus on a couple characters is something we really learned last year was a really valuable thing to do but you had to have earned enough interest in those characters to then focus on them

1645366 there are undoubtedly dozens of women across the borough who make a real difference to their communities on a daily basis who have come through adversity and are a source of inspiration for others or who have achieved a great deal in their very young lives
1645367 i would encourage anyone who knows a woman in the ards who merits a nomination to complete a form its a very straightforward process but with a potentially very rewarding result

1645369 ive been going to the island for years and i havent felt safer anywhere
1645370 weve always had 24 hour patrols but more to make sure our guests werent pestered
1645371 there has been major growth in tourism on the island with an increase in boutique type properties offering a more upmarket experience
1645372 even at this tragic time it is important that we maintain a sense of perspective
1645373 whilst spouses may have the skills experience or qualifications to make them the most appropriate candidate for work in their partners parliamentary or constituency office this is less likely to apply to mps children whether under 18 or young adults
1645374 furthermore recent incidents involving the employment by mps of their children demonstrate clearly the negative impact this has on public confidence in members
1645375 the proposal is therefore that mps children should no longer be able to gain paid employment in their parents constituency or parliamentary offices or in any other role relating to the parents work as an mp
1645376 everyone employed by the dup is employed on the basis of merit and the skills they bring to the job
1645377 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
1645378 there is no limit on the amount of sewage that can come out of these overflows they represent a licence to pollute
1645379 it is imperative that we have good water quality for our marine life and for tourism and swimmers everyone needs to see clean beaches
1645380 northern ireland prides itself on its wonderful scenery and nice environment but its a contradiction if its not as clean and wonderful as it should be
1645381 which will develop and enhance sports facilities in the borough
1645382 most young people are simply enjoying their school holidays however the police service is also aware that boredom and a lack of available entertainment plays a role in the decision of some young people to engage in activities that can lead to criminal behaviour
1645383 the police have been instructed to think constructively about the sharing of facilities with community groups and other statutory bodies such as the ambulance and library outlets in order to maintain a presence on the ground
1645384 in june it was made clear to the psni that they will not receive support for piecemeal closure an integrated plan with genuine alternatives is required
1645385 sharing a station is an idea were considering among many others
1645386 policing is about people it is not about buildings the psni has a responsibility to use all of its resources in the most effective and efficient way
1645387 with more than 500 000 children in florida not having insurance kidcare opens doors for every child to have access to health care

1645389 we heard rumors last week and the week before but they were just rumors so we didnt worry
1645390 they said last week they were going to lay off at least 200 people
1645391 its good i wish them well theyre all good people
1645392 ive already lost a job at at amp t i was there 25 years
1645393 that hurt no matter what i was hoping to stay another year or two at e one if my health was good
1645394 theres more jobs out there and well all get through it
1645395 i guess go home and sit down and relax for a while and look through the package they gave us and get on the internet
1645396 it will put upward pressure on prices and all of our costs are recovered through our cost based billing
1645397 in four years we cant build a coal plant in four years we cant build a nuclear plant and solar energy is expensive and it would have been hard to get 300 megawatts of power from solar
1645398 we looked at all of our options and this was out most cost effective option
1645399 it would be detrimental to taxpayers in the city of ocala to just give them those assets
1645400 in the real world the court would give instructions on how to deal with the minority shareholder
1645401 what i find most rewarding is helping other people become successful
1645402 we feel the court decided the case correctly and theres nothing new there to be considered that would change that
1645403 thats an issue well deal with when we get this lawsuit resolved

1645405 my dad is a huge baseball fan so he has already gotten their autographs
1645406 he asked a little later if we could possibly take two players to make sure one young man had transportation with another player
1645407 the third one we thought would be hosted by my mom but he stayed with us one night and bonded with the other players so we kept him too so thats how we got three
1645408 theres no distractions here were able to focus on baseball
1645409 hopefully we will be able to play in belleview next year and have more support from the community
1645410 we played 18 days at the rotary sportsplex in ocala and the most we would play there is 20 days should we lease it from the city
1645411 so its a misconception that the field is being built just for us
1645412 and down the road its a pride thing something the entire city can get behind and support
1645413 while the team has the name belleview bulldogs its really a regional team and hopefully it will be something they will build on for next year
1645414 it makes belleview look good and next year when they are playing in belleview it will make the city look even better
1645415 how do you get any better than this to have your first year and go to the championship
1645416 having them has been well worth it theyre great guys
1645417 for us environmental awareness and activism isnt just a question of health
1645418 its a moral and ethical issue that we hope to teach our three little girls
1645419 ive seen a dramatic increase in parents taking environmental responsibility for their children in the past 15 years
1645420 theyre realizing they need to get involved in greening their communities
1645421 after they advised me on water filtration and solar paneling
1645422 i realized wait a sending my children off to a school which can be a toxic environment
1645423 i believe its important to do your part and be responsible
1645424 but at the same time i dont want to be freaking out about it
1645425 the term used in the letter outlining the agreement is initially and certainly theres absolutely no reason if sinn fein have the mandate why leaving aside this arrangement that as a principle we have the entitlement if we have the mandate to any departmental responsibility
1645426 what we were trying to do in a sensible way was to deal with what are expressed as unionist concerns there are also nationalist and republican concerns i mean can you image a dup justice minister
1645427 so theres a trade off here in a sensible way
1645428 it is with regret that i am resigning from sinn fein this is due to disillusionment with the current sinn fein strategy i no longer share the belief that this strategy will lead to irish unification
1645429 i will remain as an independent republican councillor and will continue to concentrate on issues affecting the people of dungannon
1645430 we have received a formalised complaint from mr mcmahon and we would not be in a position to comment until that has been investigated
1645431 he didnt know me and he still cant speak its clear that hes still a very unwell person and that the flight home has taken a lot out of him
1645432 at least hes back on home soil at the moment hes in the casualty department in the royal victoria hospital in belfast where hes being examined and assessed before they decide which specialist unit to transfer him to
1645433 the only thing that has changed is that my son is back home hes still very ill and in a lot of pain the flight home had four stops in the us canada and in iceland because the plane is a small jet and it had to re fuel but it took a lot out of paul
1645434 hell still be in hospital for a long time to come possibly up to four months but at least hes close to home
1645435 its totally unacceptable that the level of behaviour has climbed to its current level and is threatening the livelihood of businesses in the town
1645436 i have been approached by both local residents and businessmen who are very concerned at the current lawlessness which seems to be focused around the police station in the church road area
1645437 several weeks ago there were two cars burnt in the carpark of a local supermarket the response by the police was said to be slow by one local resident
1645438 my concern is that the psni do not seem to be responsive even outside the police station they have a camera on the tower which they refuse to use for community safety and the new cctv cameras do not function
1645439 the police seem to be losing their grip on the issue and it needs immediate action to ensure that these unacceptable activities are addressed
1645440 in two weekends the fire service were called out to three fires set alight in buildings around the police station and needed police support before they could attend one of these
1645441 all the good work done by inspector julie blain is being lost and people want to see action now to take the situation back in hand i have raised the issue of the cctv cameras and been given assurances that they will be operational as soon as possible
1645442 police will investigate any reports of anti social behaviour in glengormley
1645443 we are aware of several recent incidents on property in the centre of the town as a result crime prevention officers are engaged in providing crime prevention advice to property owners and keyholders in the area
1645444 neighbourhood police officers are aware of ongoing problems patrols have been heightened and where offenders are detected they will be dealt with in a robust fashion and brought before the courts
1645445 however we need the support of the wider community and would appeal for anyone with information to contact police on 0845 600 8000 or ring the crimestoppers charity anonymously to on 0800 555 111
1645446 the central and crucial point in this debate is that the dup will not agree to the devolution of policing and justice powers to the northern ireland assembly until such times as there is sufficient community confidence to allow it to occur
1645447 successive governments have encouraged sinn fein to think that unreasonable demands by them will be met if the demands are repeated often enough
1645448 it now appears that sinn fein think we in the dup are not prepared to continue confronting this nonsense they seem to think a snap assembly election is something we do not want
1645449 i and my colleagues are already in pre election mode having canvassed thousands of homes in our constituencies in recent weeks
1645450 this will prove invaluable if an election is brought about in the autumn it is difficult to see what anyone thinks will change after any election but if that is what is required for sinn fein to see that the days of their demands being followed by delivery from others is over then it will have been a price worth paying
1645451 engage properly on important issues like education the environment the irish language and of course policing powers
1645452 our eye firmly fixed on our political goals as we continue to negotiate with the dup and the two governments on all of these issues
1645453 it was quite a well developed fire and there was a lot of damage the room at the front was completely gutted
1645454 i have a partner and a four year old daughter and she has known nothing other than barking dogs during the summer we cant even open a window i live in the countryside and have quite a large garden it means we are not able to enjoy our own surroundings in our own home
1645455 i am very pleased that antrim borough council took the case this far and the result obviously shows how bad the case was he has about 30 dogs and they are barking day and night
1645456 environmental health officers carried out numerous observations at the complainants home and found that the dog barking was so loud and intrusive that it was likely to prevent the complainants from getting to sleep at night or relaxing in their garden during the daytime
1645457 this is a welcome result which sends out a stark message that noise nuisances will not be tolerated in this borough it has demonstrated that flouting the law can prove to be a very costly business
1645458 we are delighted that the magistrate viewed this matter so seriously as to impose the maximum fines available as well as issuing an anti social behaviour order it is hoped that this will now mean that the complainants can finally live in the peace and quiet that is so rightly expected when living in the countryside
1645459 the family is angry that police failed arlene i believe they should have done more
1645460 the evidence was there he should have been arrested i think they left it too long
1645461 he had his alibi and his evidence cleaned up i believe if the police had done their job right hannah could have been living today
1645462 did not respond with vigour to reports that a vulnerable person was missing having last been seen in the company of a man who was a known sex offender
1645463 together these aspects should have alerted them sooner to the possibility they were dealing with a potential murder inquiry
1645464 they should have conducted their investigations accordingly until this proved not to be the case however the grounds to arrest this man were available within 48 hours of arlene being reported missing
1645465 his statement to the missing person inquiry included a number of inconsistencies he was on bail for serious sexual offences and had been convicted of a number of sexual crimes
1645466 these factors should have raised serious concerns for the whereabouts of arlene
1645467 i can feel the pain mummy oh the pain its terrible
1645468 rising tides can quickly isolate you and large swells often completely submerge these rocks so we urge every angler to check local tidal information and weather condition before venturing out onto these rocks
1645469 we always urge everyone going to sea to make sure their electrical systems and engine are well maintained and in good working order
1645470 a good anchor and chain should always be carried as part of essential safety equipment
1645471 i had to request all carters medical notes from the royal victoria hospital rvh city hospital ulster hospital and great ormond street in london
1645472 i need them so that dr douglas nordli the head of the epilepsy centre in chicago can read them and familiarise himself with carters case
1645473 but so far he has only received the notes from great ormond street were having problems getting them from hospitals here and the royal want an additional 50 to discharge carters notes
1645474 its difficult and something you shouldnt really have to cope with when you are dealing with a very sick child
1645475 at present its just medication after medication they call it a game of trial and error to find the right medicine to stabilise the seizures
1645476 hes been on 20 anti convulsion treatments and also steroids carters also been tested for a number of syndromes but doesnt fall into any definitive category
1645477 thats why the childrens memorial hospital in chicago offers such hope they can carry out the necessary tests to identify carters condition and how we can go about reducing the seizures that grip him
1645478 the belfast sewers project is crucial to reduce the risk of flooding in belfast and we are working very hard to minimise any inconvenience caused to the public during construction
1645479 i met with ni water to raise the concerns of both members of the golf club and residents on park road and i am pleased that they took these concerns on board and agreed to take steps to address this
1645480 housing and regeneration are of crucial importance in this area i felt it was important for me to discuss the needs of local people and see the area at first hand
1645481 i am determined to deal with local issues in a manner that is sensitive to the needs of the community
1645482 this visit has been worked on for the last year it was important that the local community group and myself work together to try and improve the area that the minister recognises the needs and concerns of residents within beechfield itself
1645483 the minster took the time for a walk about and to speak to residents about areas of concern which were pointed out to her including alleyways graffiti and rubbish a short meeting was then held in the community flat and areas of concern were highlighted to the minister on funding for a computer class and to look at the possibility that a part time community worker be looked into to help move beechfield forward
1645484 any basic instinct can come out in the context of sleep
1645485 ive always thought of us as a canadian band but ive never thought of us as part of the canadian music industry at all
1645486 the initiative operates in conjunction with other schemes such as the citysafe crimewatch network which links businesses so they can share information and the get home safe initiative which is aimed at keeping the streets safe at night
1645487 the multi agency approach has resulted in a huge reduction in anti social behaviour illegal street trading and traffic violations making belfast a much safer and more pleasant place to live work and spend time
1645488 working in partnership to tackle crime in belfast city centre is producing excellent results and i look forward to another successful year for belfast city centre beat
1645489 we are committed to funding this dedicated police presence in the city centre for the fourth consecutive year

1645491 not a process we can or should try to stop
1645492 desire to be known for a perverted form of sexuality
1645493 it is a cause for regret that a section of the community desire to be known for a perverted form of sexuality which in certain incidences has provoked the unacceptable and totally unjustifiable response of violence
1645494 such a response however must not intimidate the church into silence
1645495 the act of sodomy is a grave offence to every bible believer who in accepting the pure message of gods precious word express the mind of god by declaring it to be an abomination leviticus ch18 v 22 thou shalt not lie down with mankind as with womankind it is an abomination
1645496 the issue of human rights is no longer a basis for this parade as successive governments have legislated for the lowering of the age of consent the authorisation of civil partnerships and the inheritance rights of a nominated partner
1645497 this parade is not a welcome addition to our city neither is it a positive celebration of a profitable lifestyle flaunting a form of sexuality that generations of men and women have righteously resisted and by gods grace will continue to resist
1645498 it doesnt define people as complex individuals who are brothers sisters sons and daughters
1645499 it defines people by a sexual act which is deeply offensive
1645500 it certainly creates a climate of hatred by defining people as perverts it gives others licence to attack
1645501 its divisive and goes against and undermines equality legislation its also damaging to community relations
1645502 i think the ad does breach a number of codes on so many levels i know for me i feel that it was a very public attack the language is so strong and its disgraceful

1645508 the court of arbitration for sport cas has upheld the appeals filed by fc schalke 04 sv werder bremen and fc barcelona against the decision issued on 30 july 2008 by the single judge of the fifas players status committee that consequently has been set aside in its entirety
1645509 the olympic football tournament beijing 2008 is not included in the co ordinated match calendar and there is no specific decision of the fifa executive committee establishing the obligation for the clubs to release players under 23 for this tournament
1645510 the requirements to justify a legal obligation of clubs to release their players for the football tournament beijing 2008 on the basis of customary law are not met
1645511 in view of fifas recommendation made to the clubs to release their players as well as of the olympic spirit the cas call upon the good will and good sense of fifa and the clubs to find a reasonable solution with regard to players who wish to represent their country in the olympic games

1645531 the problem for future study is to determine the actual level of emotional awareness possessed by young infants a tricky empirical problem
1645532 this points us to a general problem with the literature in this area namely that accounts based on very similar data differ widely in the degree to which they attribute social awareness to young infants it is not clear how to provide a direct empirical test that would provide a choice between richer interpretations like trevarthens and more cautious ones like schaffers however maybe a strong preoccupation with identifying the infants ability leads us away from the central issue many workers argue that we should concentrate on the dyad rather than on the infant as the developing unit from this point of view it matters less whether or not there are social intentions behind the infants acts the crucial point is that parents treat these acts as if they were intentional workers like lock 1980 and newson 1979 adopt the philosophical stance of macmurray 1961 to argue that it is this parental predisposition to treat their offspring as intentional beings that leads eventually to their becoming intentional beings
1645533 because we cannot know the subjective world that infants inhabit we must invent it so as to have a starting place for hypothesis making this book is such an invention it is a working hypothesis about infants subjective experience of their own social life
1645534 while no one can agree on exactly what the self is as adults we still have a very real sense of self that permeates daily social experience
1645535 it is a basic assumption of this book that some senses of the self do exist long prior to self awareness and language these include the senses of agency of physical cohesion of continuity in time of having intentions in mind and other such experiences we will soon discuss
1645536 the newborn does not have good control of his or her head and cannot hold it aloft in the upright position but when lying on their backs so that their heads are supported newborns do have adequate control to turn the head to the left or right head turning became the answer to the following question can infants tell the smell of their own mothers milk macfarlane 1975 placed three day old infants on their backs and then placed breast pads taken from their nursing mothers on one side of their heads on the other side he placed breast pads taken from other nursing women the newborns reliably turned their heads toward their own mothers pads regardless of which side the pads were placed on the head turning answered macfarlands question in the affirmative infants are able to discriminate the smell of their own mothers milk
1645537 in fact what we are calling intersubjectivity trevarthen calls secondary intersubjectivity trevarthen and hubley 1978 the later differentiation of a uniquely human intersubjective function intersubjectivity does seem to be an emergent human capacity however it is not meaningful to speak of primary intersubjectivity at three or four months of age as trevarthen does 1979 this can only refer to protoforms that lack the essential ingredients for being called intersubjectivity only trevarthens secondary stage is true intersubjectivity
1645538 every emotion has a formal object if it has any object
1645539 the process through which the significance of a situation for an individual is determined
1645540 ronald de sousa 1987 argued that emotions are not reducible to beliefs desires or combinations of the two but represent a logically and functionally separate category of capacities they contribute essentially to the strategic choices of human deliberation and they are themselves assessable as rational or irrational in accord with criteria which overlap but are not identical with those in terms of which we judge moral and esthetic value
1645541 to date cognitive science does not seem to have provided any crucial tests to decide between competing models of the mind
1645542 communication and cooperation in early infancy a description of primary intersubjectivity
1645543 one knows intuitively as a psychologist or simply as a human being that the easy access we have into each others minds not so much in the particulars of what we are thinking but in general about what minds are like cannot be explained away by invoking singular concepts like empathy
1645544 my first brush with it the problem was in studying the development of exchange games in infancy when i was struck with how quickly and easily a child once having mastered the manipulation of objects could enter into handing back and forth handing objects around a circle exchanging objects for each other the competence seemed there as if ab ovum the performance was what needed some smoothing out very young children had something clearly in mind about what others had in mind and organized their actions accordingly i thought of it as the child achieving mastery of one of the precursors of language use a sense of mutuality of action

1645592 jawab seorang pria bernama ruaf yang duduk didepan wanita tadi sambil menunjuk sebuah buntalan kain yang sedang digendong anggota mereka yang lain yang rupanya berisi bayi
1645593 bagus kita tidak butuh tangisan bayi yang bisa membuat pasukan sanctuary menemukan kita semua siap
1645594 aku pun akan bersikap begitu kalau aku kehilangan seseorang yang kusayangi apalagi nyawa orang itu hilang di tanganku sendiri kau lihat kan ciel belum menghapus darah ellen yang melekat di tangannya

1645597 ciel apa tak ada jalan lain ke dunfall selain lewat hutan ini
1645598 bayi itu bersin karena hidungnya tertusuk ujung daun cemara lalu dia mulai bergerak gerak gelisah
1645599 oh tidak tenang sayang kau akan baik baik saja jangan menangis ya
1645600 tenang kita semua harus tenang mungkin sebaiknya kita cari gua atau apapun yang bisa melindungi kita dari hujan salju
1645601 kita sudah beristirahat untuk ke 4 kalinya hari ini dan kau mau istirahat lagi kita tak mungkin berlindung lagi ruaf waktu kita bisa habis

1645607 berikan ini padanya begitu ia cukup pantas untuk memakai kalung
1645608 seru ruaf mereka semua berlari secepat mungkin sebelum si frodice melihat mereka baru berhenti berlari ketika mereka sudah cukup dalam masuk gua dan yang pertama kali dilakukan tahtian adalah mendorong ruaf marah
1645609 kini semua orang di gua itu menangis marah kesal pada satu sama lain juga pada diri sendiri
1645610 kalian tak mengerti tak mengerti betapa inginnya dia melindungi satu satunya keturunan abarcass yang tersisa

1645613 kurasa aku tahu kenapa frodice tadi mondar mandir di depan gua
1645614 teriak ruaf sambil terus berlari dan menoleh ke druan yang juga ter engah engah

1645649 the court of arbitration for sport cas has upheld the appeals filed by schalke 04 werder bremen and barcelona against the decision issued on 30 july 2008 by the single judge of the fifas players status committee that consequently has been set aside in its entirety
1645650 no specific decision of the fifa executive committee establishing the obligation for the clubs to release players under 23 for this tournament
1645651 does not affect the eligibility status of the players who have been validly entered by their national olympic committee and who remain fully eligible to compete
1645652 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1645653 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are a unique opportunity for a player as they are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1645654 it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player and his national team who can benefit from such an experience but also his club
1645655 i have never spoken about records it is you guys in the media who have been writing about that only my coach bob bowman and myself know my goals and that is what i am hoping to achieve
1645656 he wished me luck at the us trials but apart from that i have not really spoken much to him
1645657 its a top of the line facility its exciting when you walk into the pool i can imagine the whole thing jam packed and being loud its definitely something im looking forward to walking out on that first day and being in that atmosphere
1645658 i see the way i was in los angeles in 1984 when i competed the first time and then i look at some of the younger team members
1645659 when i see some of the younger swimmers in the squad bounce off the walls with excitement i have to remind myself that i was like that myself
1645660 i lost my grandmother to cancer and i know its not an easy battle his goal was to swim at the olympic games and hes excited we are all supporting each other in everything we do
1645661 this has taught me that there are other things apart from swimming there is a lot more to life it has placed everything in perspective
1645662 i was inspired by him even before i was diagnosed
1645663 we would like to be better than we were in athens four years ago and we were already pretty good there
1645664 the relationship was consensual and it ended earlier this year after a period of some months
1645665 i take responsibility for my being involved in this relationship and i regret the hurt caused to anyone including my family
1645666 i feel this statement is warranted to put the facts in context given the media interest
1645667 i have medical advice that i am suffering from depression and have been for some time
1645668 i hope that the media will respect the privacy of myself and my family as i make my recovery
1645669 i wish to thank all those people who have expressed their good wishes and offers of support
1645670 i appeal to elaine to contact us either directly or through any intermediary to let us know how you are because we are desperate for news because we love you and miss you dreadfully
1645671 although elaine has been missing for 15 months we have not given up hope the fact that there has been sightings of her in adelaide is significant

1645674 i have apologised to all people concerned including mr gesah for these events
1645675 we obviously regret them its preferable that they hadnt occurred but they have and so we cant really do more than that
1645676 we will continue to review all those cases until we are satisfied there is no similar issue of cross contamination with respect to those cases

1645696 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1645697 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1645698 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1645699 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1645700 im glad that he stepped up to this but lets be clear he doesnt have any support in his own party yet for this and unless he can get republicans to agree with his point of view we could be here for an extended period of time

1645723 this lawsuit against santa clara demonstrates the cras ongoing commitment to establishing a flexible and reasonable statewide standard for nutritional information disclosure

1645736 the demographic assumption upon which amr khaleds thesis rest are dubious they assume that birthrate trends continue indefinitely and that cultural religious groups remain homogenous and unchanged over time those are very shaky foundations in my view
1645737 within 20 years muslims will become the majority in europe
1645738 therefore their solution is to continue the provocation against the muslims and to continue to do things that would provoke the muslims who would make mistakes such as bombings and other unusual responses then the european people would say whats this what are they doing then they would have a pretext for what would follow

1645757 when people become so blinded by ideology they commit crimes that trample the rights of their neighbors and put lives in danger the fbi must act
1645758 we hope this reward serves as an incentive to take the often difficult step of bringing important information to the attention of law enforcement
1645759 the whole idea of domestic terrorism is definitely a high priority especially in a case like this where lives were placed in danger

1645769 permission to state the following on his behalf i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
1645770 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1645771 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1645772 we feel an obligation to help open the door to allow for more of our brothers and sisters to enter
1645773 it is a labor of love rooted in creating social change

1645775 universities can reach out but they have to reach out to everyone
1645776 were focusing on students with low income and disadvantaged backgrounds
1645777 last year there were 10 counties from california that did not send a single student to berkeley ten
1645778 there is some additional flexibility afforded to students in terms of their outreach and how they design outreach
1645779 we call the schools and get the demographics of how many african americans go to that school then we put together thousands of packets with fliers like an introduction to the university financial aid how to write essays
1645780 we go to the classes that have never heard of berkeley before
1645781 they are passionate about what theyre doing because they care
1645782 the students have seen the need for greater diversity and have taken it upon themselves to assist and supplement the universitys effort
1645783 i went out there and grabbed it and i was like oh my gosh that cant be gold it is and then i ran up to my dad and i showed him
1645784 i was going to go slew some gold to go to the senior prom and about the second shovel a 4 ounce gold nugget rolled right in the tip of my shovel
1645785 i stuck it in my pocket and ran to town
1645786 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1645787 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1645788 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes

1645806 im voting for the county hospital bonds and the school bonds in my area and thats it
1645807 it will be a low budget campaign and theres not much margin for error
1645808 i think we have to be as cautious as possible to get the best chance of passage
1645809 what weve found running initiative campaigns for more than 20 years is that silicon valley voters are really smart and they vote for what is in their best interest

1645827 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1645828 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1645829 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programmes that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1645830 in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1645831 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1645832 this is not a blame game all we want is for hsbc to facilitate the delivery of our presents
1645833 we believe this would be easily achieved and could actually be cheaper than organising refunds the deliveries could be organised at cost price and would be a huge publicity coup for them it could save them money as well
1645834 were going to remind hsbc that there is more than just numbers involved and that they have an opportunity to do the right thing and help everybody including themselves
1645835 hsbcs view is that this should never have happened and had the directors acted sooner to address their financial difficulties and appointed administrators when hsbc recommended it may not have happened
1645836 hsbc fully appreciates how wrapits customers feel about this issue and understands their distress and concern that a resolution be found quickly
1645837 i will not condemn you for what you did yesterday if you do it right today
1645838 its better to build two states and be friends than build one and become enemies for the rest of our lives
1645839 an israeli child from a far right settler group in the west bank city of hebron hurls a stone up the stairs of a palestinian family close to their settlement and shouts
1645840 and with so many intriguing angles to look at this pre season we had to jump out in front of the pack and give the people what theyre looking for
1645841 we have rid the country of the harmful practice that saw state decisions taken under pressure from commodities and financial monopolies media magnates foreign political circles and shameless populists a practice that was not only detrimental to our national interests but that cynically ignored the basic needs of millions of people
1645842 our children will no longer have to pay our old debts the state foreign debt has shrunk to 3 percent of gdp one of the lowest ratios in the world what choice can there be between the opportunity to become a leader in economic and social development a leader in ensuring our national security and the threat of losing our economic standing losing our security and ultimately even losing our sovereignty russia must become the country offering the best life and i am sure that we can achieve this goal not by sacrificing the present for some radiant future but by working day by day to improve peoples lives the transition to an innovative development path calls above all for large scale investment in human capital human development is the main goal and essential condition for progress in modern society this is our absolute national priority now and in the future russias future and our success depend on peoples education and health and their desire to improve themselves and make use of their skills and talents i am not saying this because presidential elections are just around the corner this is not a campaign slogan this is vital for our countrys development russias future depends on our citizens enthusiasm for innovation and on the fruit of the labors of each and every individual political parties must not forget their immense responsibility for russias future for the nations unity and for our countrys stable development no matter how fierce the political battles and no matter how irreconcilable the differences between parties might be they are never worth so much as to bring the country to the brink of chaos irresponsible demagogy and attempts to divide society and use foreign help or intervention in domestic political struggles are not only immoral but are illegal they belittle our peoples dignity and undermine our democratic state russias political system must not only be in accordance with our national political culture but should develop together with it then it will be both flexible and stable
1645843 russia has a response to these new challenges and it always will
1645844 the use of new technology calls for a rethinking of strategy in the way our armed forces are organized after all new breakthroughs in bio nano and information technology could lead to revolutionary changes in weapons and defense
1645845 the unhelpful remarks and really i will use a different word reprehensible rhetoric that is coming out of moscow is unacceptable
1645846 what if anything does the christian gospel have to say to powerless black men
1645847 threatened on a daily basis by the insidious tentacles of white power
1645848 we cannot afford to buy even one kilogram of maize because of the high price
1645849 many people would die if they didnt receive this relief food
1645850 we are facing so many disasters at the same time
1645851 we beg him that everything will turn out to be good
1645852 the only problem is that my feet hurt i spent seven days on that mountain it was hard it was terrible
1645853 i will not condemn you for what you did yesterday if you do it right today
1645854 i dont have any expectations but my goal is to win this time in the past when you first get there you are so overwhelmed with being at a national championship and trying to make the cut and advance into match play and playing well its a lot for one golfer
1645855 i think my game is at the point where i can make a realistic run at this championship my game feels very good right now i still have areas where i need improvement but its all a progression from here on
1645856 at the end of the event you have played 36 holes every day on long golf courses its a real test physically and mentally i know for myself once you get through stroke play its a huge relief just to get to match play and if youre lucky to win one or two matches its very draining
1645857 something i have greatly improved over the last number of years has been my fitness and my stamina both mentally and physically with the condition that i am in i feel i could go the entire process in winning it and i have the confidence knowing that i can compete with the best players in the nation
1645858 but i never considered myself a veteran im only 23
1645859 demian has put together a couple of wins in the ufc and i guess hes placed himself in a position where they want to test him
1645860 the one thing demian maia has is he always has that threat to submit you at any time
1645861 i believe strongly that his overall mixed martial arts game is nowhere near the level of his grappling game
1645862 so obviously i feel i have more experience against tougher competition and a heck of a lot more experience in the mixed martial arts world and im going to try and use those two things to my favour in this fight
1645863 and certainly demian maia in my opinion is nowhere the level of standup than those guys had
1645864 i want to fight the guys that are scratching and clawing at the top of this division but im not looking past demian maia its very clear to me that i have to take out demian maia to consolidate my spot as one of the top guys in this division
1645865 the middleweight divisions in desperate need of a contender right now
1645866 everybodys jockeying for position under anderson right now and any one fighter that can string together two or three quality wins will become the next contender and pat was able to do that
1645867 i couldnt speak highly enough of the guys as far as the team atmosphere and making me comfortable and the level of training
1645868 but i was living in a gym and just really really out of my comfort zone
1645869 i wouldnt say that was the reason for me being unsuccessful you know what im more comfortable at home in my comfort zone with all my resources that i have on hand i feel like im getting everything i need right here right now and i feel like im getting better every fight so im not going to change it up
1645870 i stayed at home and stuck with what works for me
1645871 for me my comfort zone is at home close to my family close to my three kids obviously i have a new business so close to my new business and i feel like im getting the training im needing here i have great coaches and im fighting a jiu jitsu black belt so why would i travel away from josh russell when hes right here with me
1645872 i think they were the two favourites heading into national eliminations and they came no 1 and no 2
1645873 at the nationals last year for the youth selects shain threw a no hitter and a two hitter
1645874 hes a phenomenal athlete hes another guy that has scouts looking
1645875 it can make or break you if they get solid pitching i think both teams will compete well
1645876 in the five years that i have been director we have never lost a game
1645877 the last time it was held in sydney we had games delayed but we got them all in but as of right now mother nature is not co operating
1645878 this all depends if we get the tournament going again on wednesday today
1645879 if not then it will be up to little leagues head office in williamsport pennsylvania
1645880 the surface has been covered but the ground has absorbed a lot of moisture
1645881 today we took 27 000 liters of water off that field and once we stopped the pumps that water was back again even a secondary field we looked at the infield was ok but the outfield unplayable
1645882 i know life sometimes can get tough and i know life sometimes can be a drag
1645883 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1645884 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen
1645885 id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it to be honest with you
1645886 were a good team and we havent been playing well
1645887 things happen like i said were not in middle school we should be able to get over it
1645888 i know if we run amp jump high enough we should be able to make it to the other side
1645889 two companies are going in one direction and were headed in another
1645890 when you are building up a route the first priority is to build up traffic
1645891 the belfast base is performing well and performing to expectation
1645892 we are where we want to be and quite satisfied
1645893 the damage that was caused to our reputation in the shannon area during three or four months of last year
1645894 market conditions for the industry remain very difficult on the back of high oil prices and a weak economic environment
1645895 long haul premium remains broadly flat versus last year while non premium bookings remain most sensitive to price changes
1645896 roughly half of bas revenues come from premium tickets so it is a very important profit generator particularly with the current economic weakness and plummeting consumer confidence
1645897 it is going up by 12 percentage points in the current financial year which is more than the total operating margin of the company
1645898 that is a challenge for the aviation industry which it cant match by raising ticket prices
1645899 if or when oil jumps up again airline shares will come down just as fast as they are now going up
1645900 we are delighted to take delivery of this fantastic vehicle one of 60 being donated by land river to red cross societies around the world
1645901 this will make a very real difference to some of the hundreds of thousands of people that red cross supports globally each year and to our work in communities throughout northern ireland
1645902 sustained growth which is seeing the company serve an extra two million customers a month compared to last year
1645903 creating more than 150 new jobs in northern ireland is great news for our business and our franchisees particularly in these tougher trading times
1645904 and with 4 000 jobs in total being created across the uk it is a clear signal that customers are responding to the restaurant modernisation programme and menu changes that we have been rolling out over the last couple of years
1645905 we may be entering choppy economic waters but as a company that is more recession resistant than many we can continue offering people a job with excellent career progression training and development opportunities and flexibility
1645906 this is my livelihood i want to make a name for myself
1645907 i also have to do it for boxing canada this is make or break if i do well in this tournament it can do well for our future fighters in this country
1645908 i dont want to call it a monkey on the back
1645909 i dont think we came back with the thought of fixing something so much has changed
1645910 the further you get from the athens regatta the less important it becomes i think that has evolved in the last three or four weeks the closer we get to the first race the less important is the last four years
1645911 i cant worry so much about the medal we are going to win
1645912 i think we have to win by the fact the team is a great team as a unit
1645913 if you are not prepared for the olympics its quite overwhelming
1645914 ive already walked through this pass before and i feel much more prepared
1645915 my whole goal for him was hes got to show me golf is the most important thing in his life
1645916 and the most important thing in his life is getting drunk
1645917 i had rib surgery two months ago i just had a cyst in my right hand and they finally got that out now ive got tendinitis in my left elbow
1645918 i work hard for those moments i like those moments its special today thats what i want to do try to help the team win
1645919 the most important thing to me is to stay healthy
1645920 my health is good i can do whatever i can to help the team win im very happy im back in the lineup
1645921 it changes the game hes one of the big superstars in the game i think moreso than his ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark he loosens us up with his charisma and character before and after the game hes a huge part of who we are
1645922 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1645923 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1645924 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1645925 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1645926 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1645927 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1645928 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1645929 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1645930 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1645931 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1645932 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1645933 security for the olympic games is of paramount importance the more we give the safer and more secure the residents will feel
1645934 i heard the attack yesterday morning it was not loud it just sounded like a cars tire bursting
1645935 it doesnt seem like there are more police on the streets but the neighbourhood patrols seem to be tighter theyre coming around and checking more often
1645936 are we there yet we must be there right baba
1645937 ah humbaba why youre late ive never known you to be tardy
1645938 well i wouldnt have been late if i didnt have to fight all those armed men on the road
1645939 aye they were a lot of them i had to fight an old wizard an elvish archer and a feisty dwarven fellow youre welcome for getting rid of the likes of them
1645940 could this man have truly disposed of gandalf the wizard gimili of the dwarves and legolas of the elves but they were going to be his comrades
1645941 we need you to destroy the evil lord grendel because i am sure of it that he is going to be on the warpath soon it seems that he is amassing an army to find his precious one ring and will burn the whole of middle earth to find it
1645942 well what would you say if i told you that we found this one ring he is looking for
1645943 what what could you mean do you mean to tell me that you actually have the one ring but thats preposterous the one ring has been in mordor for centuries how did you obtain such a thing
1645944 well we hard of the worth of such a ring so we thought wed go and git it
1645945 you went to mordor and simply took their most precious artifact
1645946 we didnt really take it per se but rather won it after killing everyone guarding it
1645947 no he wasnt there when we took it lucky us eh
1645948 i see well it seems that we still have a talk of you we request of you the monk and of you humbaba to destroy lord grendel and spare us from him tyranny forever more
1645949 splendid our brave companions have returned come and sit you must be weary from your journey
1645950 yeah that sounds great and all but what about our reward

1645959 it was a unique opportunity to create applications to deliver content to millions of facebook users across the globe
1645960 the entries were of a high calibre and we believe lot of the applications have the potential to be successful and popular in facebook
1645961 we were very impressed with the response from the it community in south africa and the creativity and quality of the applications
1645962 we have received a letter from vohra to visit the site we turn it down but we will convene a meeting of executive committee later in the day and then reply
1645963 we have already made the sass stand clear to the governor that nothing short of revocation of cancellation order and restoration of powers to the board will be acceptable
1645964 i dont know who you are why are you talking to me
1645965 the current global economic conditions will have an inevitable impact on northern irelands economic performance
1645966 although growth is forecast to decline in 2008 it is expected to remain relatively robust at around 1 8
1645967 a strong labour market and recent success in foreign labour market and export markets should help limit the impact of the slowdown on the economy
1645968 at a time when firms are already suffering from the fall out of the credit crunch rising oil and energy prices are particularly unwelcome moreover recent reductions in house prices have dampened consumer confidence
1645969 the strength of the labour market where the number of employee jobs stands at an all time high of 722 120 coupled with increased investment in r amp d will help many local firms retain their competitive position
1645970 but really my dad ian named me after one of his heroes guy gibson who led the famous dambusters raid with 617 squadron in 1943
1645971 gibson and his crew flew out of lincolnshire not far from where i live and he is obviously a hero in these parts
1645972 as far as i am concerned the ulster grand prix is my favourite race
1645973 im only a newcomer on this scene for im 25 years old but certainly you can take it from me that the ulster grand prix provides my favourite circuit in that dundrod has no stupid chicanes and is a flowing track its ideal for my style and im certainly hoping to do the business later this month
1645974 its really a weekend out for most of them and their main concentration is on the isle of man tt a couple of weeks later
1645975 i never seem to get any luck at this meeting for i had a big crash in the 600cc class at black hill
1645976 this north west performance was a part of what i regard as my worst season to date what promised to be exceptional turned out to be a nothing series of races i didnt want to wreck myself before the isle of man tt and i held a lot in reserve when i was riding at the north west
1645977 but at the tt i had more machine problems and i never managed to get into the action still the tt remains my main objective and hopefully ill do much better when i compete there next year
1645978 as for the ulster grand prix i give myself every chance next saturday i have won every class at the meeting except superstock so ill have to make up for that blemish i fancy myself for the superbike races and hopefully ill win one of them you know im really looking forward to this and i feel it has been such a poor season as far as i am concerned i really must do better
1645979 nothing upsets her even the odd obscenity which we are inclined to utter throughout a hectic race kate takes it all in her stride and shes very good at her job its not just that shes good for a woman shes as good as any man
1645980 i dont feel im quick i just get used to the bike and away i go the speed in many ways is irrelevant once you get up to a certain figure you just let it happen
1645981 but theres no doubt that mcguinness in particular has the class to take this race by the scruff of the neck
1645982 i remember racing against him in the mid antrim 150 it was my second year at the meeting and i spoiled his attempt to win a five timer after he had lifted the four previous races
1645983 i like the mid antrim circuit and if anyone were to ask me to show them a typical irish road surface i would take them to the mid antrim
1645984 i was third behind mcguinness and ian lougher in only my second time there that was really something
1645985 i think i have more wins there than anyone else
1645986 if our season is over on saturday then he wont be back but i would hope that andy can be back playing again by mid september and thats not suggesting anything other than club football
1645987 make no mistake hes a huge loss experience of croke park is a key element wexford have been there three times while the majority of our panel have never been there before
1645988 well treat them with the same respect that we would afford kerry or dublin
1645989 they are in the quarter finals on merit and we know we must raise our game to a different level if were to progress
1645990 i am looking at a number of measures and i am not going to be drawn on that today because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do it is helping people that is important i want to look at a range of options
1645991 onze procedure loopt nu al 17 jaar wij hebben nog geen eurocent schadevergoeding gekregen nadat 55 000 liter kerosine in onze tuinen liep wij laten ons nu niet meer met een kluitje in het riet sturen het is nu tijd voor actie

1645998 het is daarom dat we meerdere malen moeten terugkeren naar het begin om tussen al wat we verworven hebben de goede elementen uit te halen en ze als voedingsboden uit te zaaien voor het verder opouwen van onze wereld want een bloem zal elke lente weer met dezelfde traagheid haar schoonheid ontluiken de kat zorgt steeds weer met dezelfde liefde voor haar nieuwgeboren jongen vissen blijven de zee talrijk bewonen een kind zal steeds vallen maar weer opstaan met de wil te lopen het is aan ons om er voor te zorgen dat dit kan blijven voor t bestaan

1646001 weve lost more business to ebay than we have to any new competitors in the last two or three years
1646002 there is never legitimate stuff on ebay thats a lot less than retail unless its used counterfeit or stolen
1646003 usually the ebay prices are somewhere in the neighbourhood of half to three quarters of regular retail
1646004 taylormade has spent countless hours developing and testing numerous materials and technologies work that is not found in a counterfeit club
1646005 because we see these authentic clubs every day its easier for us to pick a fake out but for the consumer its tough

1646021 remember this day on which you left egypt the abode of slavery because adonai by the strength of his hand has brought you out of this place for seven days you are to eat matzah and the seventh day is to be a festival for adonai on that day you are to tell your son it is because of what adonai did for me when i left egypt
1646022 welcome to sderot below are some safety tips to remember while you are here there are qassams 1 when a qassam is fired from gaza the safety alert will sound and it is important to try to find a bomb shelter 2 if you cannot find a bomb shelter get inside stay away from windows 3 if you cannot get inside find a stairwell or a covered structure 4 if you cannot find cover lie down on the ground and put your hands over your head 5 whatever you do dont run and dont panic
1646023 we are arguing about hamas and i think they succeed because they make the people in gaza proud
1646024 if they dont come here to protect us why would i want to help them
1646025 once when a fell on our apartment building hitting the apartment next door i sat at the window and watched
1646026 ido told us when we came in she came here twenty years ago but she only speaks russian
1646027 that you want to be clean after you take a shower
1646028 if they launched a qassam right now you would see it go up like this
1646029 to the family from this morning they asked us to come back when they got home from work ten oclock thats now we should go back and talk to them some more

1646040 i have always thought that the congestion charge is a blunt instrument it has proved successful in cutting traffic coming into london but on its own has not resolved the problem of congestion various works and schemes going on in the capital have also eroded its impact i am therefore introducing a more comprehensive approach to easing congestion in london
1646041 congestion would be a lot worse were it not for the charge
1646042 tfl needs to manage the roadworks better which is plainly possible traffic lights can also be rephased by giving less green time to pedestrians and more to traffic
1646043 without the congestion charge the traffic problems in london would be much worse however as a result of other interventions such as utility and construction works the reduction in road space has had a detrimental impact on congestion levels and is slowing traffic down
1646044 up to 70 of people who have chlamydia have no symptoms they are at huge risk of serious long term health complications including infertility and ectopic pregnancy
1646045 we are keen to support the availability of more medicines over the counter where it is safe to do so making this medicine available from a pharmacy is a real example of how we are enabling people to play an active role in taking charge of their own healthcare

1646049 if we dont get a strong number oil prices will likely fall further
1646050 elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1646051 i expect prices to fall to between 100 and 110 by the end of the year
1646052 technical wise its oversold i do believe we will see some relief buying within the next one week
1646053 investors or speculators have entered the market but at this moment buying is not big
1646054 anyway platinum prices have decreased so much so any time automobile companies change their minds they will start to buy little by little
1646055 market participants who are still long might be looking for an opportunity to offload their positions that are above 900
1646056 any spike towards 900 will be met by selling pressure from those who want to get out of their stale positions
1646057 the security agents came to our home and took away my father
1646058 but my people would not heed my voice and israel would have none of me
1646059 so i gave them over to their own stubborn heart to walk in their own counsels
1646060 oh that my people would listen to me that israel would walk in my ways
1646061 i would soon subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their adversaries
1646062 he would have fed them also with the finest of wheat and with honey from the rock i would have satisfied you
1646063 con ello nos adelantamos a una presunta o posible decisi n del tsj de decir que con una sola decisi n y decir con ello que la sentencia estar a apegada a la constituci n

1646065 this progression of lies has brought us to one of the most dangerous nuclear crises since 1945 because the real threat remains almost unmentionable in western establishment circles and therefore in the media there is only one rampant nuclear power in the middle east and that is israel the heroic mordechai vanunu tried to warn the world in 1986 when he smuggled out evidence that israel was building as many as 200 nuclear warheads in defiance of un resolutions israel is today clearly itching to attack iran fearful that a new american administration might just might conduct genuine negotiations with a nation the west has defiled since britain and america overthrew iranian democracy in 1953
1646066 estoy contento con esta segunda oportunidad en el 2006 hicimos un buen trabajo pero la falta de preparaci n como selecci n nos perjudic esperamos que en esta ocasi n las cosas sean diferentes

1646084 of the murder cases filed in our office the slaying of the five students kidnapped in sta mesa manila last march 8 1992 was the most heinous
1646085 the victims after they were clubbed with wood and a hand gun were burned on the face with a blowtorch tied on their backs and necks and then twisted until their tongues came out they were tortured and died from a most painful death
1646086 once it is proven that our members are the ones responsible
1646087 the assailants grossly abused the name and reputation of inc in order to kill the suspicions of the victims no one would expect treachery at a reconciliation meeting to which one had been invited in the name of the religious group especially one whose adherents address one another as brother and sister
1646088 up to the time the inc released this statement it seemed as if the inc was behaving the way the aquila legis fraternity did after some members killed lenny villa until the inc released that statement people were beginning to regard the suspects as an inc gang not as a bunch of hoodlums who just happen to be inc members

1646093 ni miguel cabrera carlos guill n y mi persona no vamos a ir al cl sico mundial el a o que viene porque luis sojo ser el m nager nuevamente punto
1646094 sojo fue la peor decisi n que se pudo haber tomado esto es una locura ese tipo hizo las cosas mal en el primer cl sico y ahora lo vuelven a nombrar qu es esa
1646095 qui nes conforman el comit organizador encargados de escoger y anunciar a sojo el viernes humberto y carlos miguel oropeza y ellos como dirigentes de cardenales de lara montaron all a luis sojo ese proceso fue un paro una mentira un teatro por eso es que yo junto a cabrera y guill n decidimos no asistir al cl sico la nica manera de que representemos a venezuela es que sojo salga del cargo
1646096 nosotros somos los que jugamos y no puede ser que no nos hayan preguntado nada ellos el comit tomaron la decisi n que les dio la gana y ni yo ni mis compa eros estamos dispuestos a participar en este bochinche los fan ticos no se merecen una organizaci n as ni mucho menos un m nager como sojo que no dio la talla cuando tuvo su chance
1646097 alguien debe darse cuenta de que luis sojo no es el tipo indicado para dirigir a la selecci n y lo mejor ser a que lo quitaran de ah si no respetan a los peloteros por lo menos respeten a los fan ticos que quieren en el puesto del m nager a una persona apta tambi n quiero hacer un llamado a todos los peloteros que fueron al torneo pasado y a los que podr an sumarse como nuevas piezas tenemos que ser unidos en las buenas y en las malas la gente que cuadr todo lo relacionado con la selecci n del m nager no nos tom en cuenta y ahora nosotros debemos hacernos respetar aquel que quiera asistir que lo haga pero vean m s all de esas ganas no podemos subordinarnos a alguien como sojo
1646098 la nica forma de que vaya es que sojo no est
1646099 mi participaci n est en veremos a n no lo s
1646100 no me esperaba que anunciaran a sojo creo que hay muchas otras personas calificadas para ese cargo pero sinceramente el problema no es con l es con el comit organizador que en ning n momento nos consult nada
1646101 mi participaci n est en veremos porque la verdad no me gust nada como se manejaron las cosas aunque todo se puede conversar lo que realmente me molesta es la poca importancia que nos dieron a nosotros los peloteros
1646102 cuando parte de la comitiva viaj hasta estados unidos para hacernos unas encuestas en realidad fue un proceso poco organizado yo no llen ninguna de esas planillas aunque me imagino que de igual forma me anotaron ah como si yo hubiese dado mi voto a favor de sojo
1646103 sojo era la persona m s indicada por su experiencia
1646104 sojo no fue el responsable de lo que pas lo que sucedi fue que no bateamos lo suficiente

1646106 i dont like the way hes behaving thats not the will smith i know
1646107 the white house had concocted a fake letter from the director of the iraqi intelligence service to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1646108 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1646109 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1646110 they secretly resettled the intelligence official in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1646111 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1646112 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1646113 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1646114 suskind says that cia was directed to get an iraqi official to copy the bogus information in his own hand and then cause it to be leaked to the media there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1646115 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1646116 we need to send a message to the next president that if he conducts himself in a similar capacity it would be met with a response from the congress that you are going to be held to account there is a point at which you reduce congress to a debating society
1646117 echoed at the top of cia and was of course briefed to the president and vice president

1646172 women who have endometriosis express this enzyme in both the early and late stages of the menstrual cycle which means that the cells will continue to divide and lose their focus in supporting the establishment of a pregnancy
1646173 as a result the lining of the womb may be more hostile to an early pregnancy and the cells that are shed at this late stage in the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive and more able to survive and implant outside the uterus causing pain in the pelvic or abdomen area
1646174 this is an interesting piece of research which highlights differences between women with endometriosis and those without
1646175 however whilst we welcome any research which increase our understanding of this condition we appreciate that this is still a long way from providing a complete understanding of the condition or indeed new therapies
1646176 servizi in uscita sono tutti consentiti quindi non dovete fare niente azione
1646177 in quel momento mi trovavo in questura dove stavo facendo i verbali dei miei interventi in precedenza
1646178 frasi sconnesse e urla qualcuno dava calci al paraurti dellauto
1646179 durante il percorso per andare allippodromo racconta enzo pontani uno degli agenti imputati per la morte di federico aldrovandi bulgarelli gli comunica che erano arrivate ulteriori sollecitazioni dintervento arrivando allaltezza del parcheggio abbiamo iniziato a sentire delle frasi sconnesse e delle urla cera qualcuno allinterno del parcheggio abbiamo puntato le luci sul parcheggio perch era buio pesto abbiamo visto una persona che ha iniziato a dare due calci al paraurti della macchina
1646180 mi ha sconvolto il suo collo taurino aldrovandi era fuori di s
1646181 noi ci fermiamo e allimprovviso sbuca questa persona che ci d due calci al paraurto e lautista istintivamente fa una breve retromarcia di qualche metro non so dire quanto
1646182 inizialmente mi sembrava un extracomunitario perch era scuro forse per via dellombra
1646183 urlava polizia di merda stato di merda e ha tirato un calcio contro lauto
1646184 ma questo inizia a urlare frasi del tipo stato di merda polizia di merda e poi mi si scaglia contro con un calcio diretto al volto contro la portiera
1646185 il ragazzo saltava a vuoto alzava entrambe le gambe per aria girandosi appena io mi sono rivolto a lui il ragazzo ha detto le frasi che gli ho gi riferito
1646186 ha messo i piedi sul paraurti e il tergicristallo poi mi ha dato un calcio
1646187 il ragazzo saltava a vuoto alzava entrambe le gambe per aria girandosi appena io mi sono rivolto a lui il ragazzo ha detto le frasi che gli ho gi riferito
1646188 ha fatto uno scatto fulmineo ha messo il piedi destro sul paraurti per darsi uno slancio un secondo passo sul tergicristallo per darsi slancio e il terzo per dare un calcio diretto al mio volto
1646189 era una furia scatenata ho chiesto aiuto al mio autista
1646190 come se nulla fosse si rialzato racconta pontani sembrava rimbalzato da terra ha iniziato a sferrarmi calci e colpi e io mi sono limitato a parare questi colpi poi sono riuscito a cingerlo da dietro
1646191 sono riuscito a cingerlo alle spalle ad avvinghiarlo sotto le spalle solo che era una furia scatenata e ho urlato al mia autista vieni aiutami sono riuscito mala pena a trattenerlo a terra perch lui ha inziato a sgomitare a calciare sono riuscito con uno sforzo invcredibile a girarlo e a un certo punto mi sono sentito sfiorare la pistola e ho avuto paura perch ho pensato se mi prende la pistola qui qualcuno si fa male
1646192 sono salito anche io di corsa sulla macchina chiudo la portiera ma a quel punto non si chiude pi
1646193 siamo andati via dal piazzale ma lui continuava a urlare
1646194 lo vedevamo a tratti mentre usciva e entrava nel parchetto
1646195 in quei momenti si pensa ad altro non al tempo
1646196 pensavo volesse aggredire la mia collega mi sono messo in mezzo
1646197 forlani riesce con due o tre strattoni ad aprirmi la porta io scendo e spiego che cera una persona pericolosissima che mi aveva aggredito
1646198 capisco che voleva aggredire la mia collega e ho pensato se le salta addosso lammazza
1646199 ho visto la mia collega spaurita che stava indietreggiando e a quel punto mi sono frapposto tra lui e lei
1646200 cero io e i miei colleghi nessun altro pu dire com andata
1646201 federico con un calcio ha rotto il manganello di un collega
1646202 era una furia non mi dava tregua a quel punto i miei colleghi si sono avvicinati e vedendo in che situazione mi trovavo lhanno circondato e hanno inziato a colpire con i manganelli e a chivare nel contempo i suoi calci
1646203 io e forlani siamo riusciti a ributtare gi il ragazzo
1646204 nel momento in cui dopo averlo ammanettato mi sono alzato nuovamente lui ha ripreso a scalciare
1646205 arriva lambulanza e a noi sembra tutto a posto ma i sanitari si agitano
1646206 chiamo la centrale la telefonata delle 6 12 e sento in lontananza le ambulanze
1646207 ci mettiamo a due metri dagli operatori del 118 e ci sembrava tutto normale poi vediamo i sanitari agitarsi la dottoressa anche
1646208 la stessa telefonata ad altri sembrava affannata e non preoccupata o concitata
1646209 pubblico ministero faccia lesame allimputato e poi alla fine si riserva le sue conclusioni
1646210 fino al momento in cui ha visto i sanitari agitarsi era preoccupato o no
1646211 il ragazzo non chiese aiuto solo urla e cose incomprensibili
1646212 cosa vuol dire tanti si dica di quanti testimoni si sta parlando e in che momento
1646213 spingere il ragazzo mentre era a terra la polizia non fa queste cose
1646214 glielho gi spiegato come lo avevamo immobilizzato tenendolo per braccia e gambe
1646215 non ho avuto la percezione che il ragazzo stava morendo
1646216 no in tanti anni di strada risponde lui ho visto persone assopirsi riprendersi
1646217 la relazione di servizio mi sono fatto aiutare dallispettore dossi
1646218 generalmente non mi aiuta nessuno ma questa volta ero cos distrutto che mi sono fatto aiutare dallispettore dossi
1646219 le relazioni sono fatte in maniera sintetiche e quando parliamo di ausilio intendiamo che abbiamo chiamato anche lambulanza
1646220 mi sono tolto la pistola un poliziotto non lo fa mai
1646221 guardi che essendo stata unaggressione nei nostri confronti avrei potuta trattarla io come volanti ma proprio perch aveva avuto un epilogo cos terribile ed essendo noi sconvolti sono intervenuti i colleghi
1646222 aldrovandi si ferito al volto cadendo dopo essersi arrampicato sullauto
1646223 esclude che ci siano stati comportamenti lesivi vostri che abbiano potuto provocare quelle lesioni
1646224 i manganelli li impugnavamo in 4 lo hanno colpito alle gambe
1646225 li impugnavamo tutti e quattro i miei tre colleghi li hanno utilizzato per colpirlo alle gambe
1646226 come mai nella prima annotazione che lei fa nella sua relazione dice che ha chiesto solo ausili mentre nella seconda annotazione riferita alla seconda comunicazione via radio specifica che ha richiesto sia rinforzi che lintervento di unambulanza
1646227 ho colpito il ragazzo con lo sfollagente nella parte bassa delle gambe
1646228 sicuramente ho colpito alcune volte con lo sfollagente il ragazzo nella parte bassa delle gambe
1646229 quando sono arrivati i carabinieri federico era ancora vivo stava bene
1646230 lultima volta che ho visto il giovane dimenarsi stato quando sono arrivati i carabinieri sul posto che era morto labbiamo saputo venti minuti dopo
1646231 quando sono arrivati i carabinieri era sicuramente vivo stava sicuramente bene
1646232 una persona che respira secondo me dal punto di vista vitale sta bene
1646233 non gli ho chiesto come stava mi bastava sapere che respirava
1646234 dopo quello che era successo mi bastava sapere che respirava
1646235 no non c lho mai con nessuno anche se mi prendo delle parole o delle botte
1646236 e stato forte veder rianimare il rqagazzo senza capire perch
1646237 stata una cosa abbastanza forte vedere le pratiche di rianimazione sul ragazzo senza capirne il perch
1646238 le ferite alla testa per me compatibili con la caduta a terra
1646239 non sapevamo cosa ci aspettava andavamo solo ad aiutare i colleghi
1646240 imbocchiamo la strada e la percorriamo abbastanza lentamente perch non sapevamo che cosa ci aspettava sapevamo solo di andare in ausilio alla volante dei colleghi
1646241 la segatto ha chiesto ai colleghi ma vi hanno sparato
1646242 veramente arrabbiato carico digridgnava i denti stava venendo avanti e mentre stavo chiudendo la portiera sento pollastri che sollecita nuovamente lambulanza
1646243 mi sono gettato su di lui gli ho afferrato il cappuccio e lho tirato indietro
1646244 per tenerlo fermo gli ho premuto una mano sulla spalla e una sul gomito
1646245 luca pollastri ndr gli ha messo un anello ammanettando prima un polso
1646246 in quel momento spiega lo stavamo trattenendo in due perch ancora si dimenava
1646247 mai sentito dire basta non mi sembrava facesse fatica a respirare
1646248 ma non gli venuto in mente di girarlo per farlo respirare
1646249 il manganello si rotto mentre cadevo per terra con aldrovandi
1646250 voleva colpire gli agenti dopo che lo abbiamo ammanettato voleva rialzarsi era reattivo
1646251 non ho mai ricevuto in 26 anni di carriera denunce di nessun tipo
1646252 noi lo abbiamo girato lui cercava di muoversi e di alzarsi si muoveva su un fianco e voleva ancora alzarsi era molto reattivo
1646253 non abbiamo verificato lo stato delle ferite del ragazzo n in faccia n altrove
1646254 il mio manganello ha fatto perno sullasfalto e si spezzato allaltezza dellimpugnatura
1646255 sisentivano delle urla anzi non erano urla erano pi ringhi
1646256 ricordo che non era una nota che aveva carattere durgenza
1646257 si sentivano delle urla ma urla non il termine giusto erano pi ringhi
1646258 aveva lo sguardo perso e la bocca aperta con i denti serrati
1646259 vedo che un uomo racconta la poliziotta poi mentre si avvicina vedo che grosso
1646260 fu il mio capopattuglia a dire di prendere almeno gli sfollagente
1646261 pontani era il suo obiettivo ma tirava anche calci laterali
1646262 il ragazzo non ha mai chiesto aiuto non ha mai parlato n prima n dopo la collutazione
1646263 non lo ha mai fatto non ha mai chiesto aiuto non ha mai parlato n prima n dopo la collutazione
1646264 abbiamo percepito che stava accadendo qualcosa quando sono iniziate le manovre per rianimarlo
1646265 allinizio quando sono arrivati i sanitari sembrava una normale operazione sanitaria
1646266 quando lui uscito dal parchetto era solo un ombra poi quando si avvicinato ho visto che era un uomo e poi lo sguardo spalancato lho visto perch era incollato al mio

1646272 are you some kind of creep were you just hiding back there are you stalking me
1646273 no i was up here and then you were and i saw you and i dont think you should be doing what it looked like you were doing
1646274 whatever i was about to do wasnt any of your business
1646275 whatever you were about to do well whatever it was it looked dangerous and had i not said anything it would have just made me feel like a murderer for not at least trying to stop it from happening
1646276 oh so what youre saying to me is that i shouldnt jump off the edge of this building this edge right here
1646277 why should i give a flying fuck what some strange drunk on a rooftop says you dont even know me how can you want to help
1646278 there now you know me so just listen to me okay and maybe give me your name
1646279 well say what you need to say youre postponing my leap of faith here
1646280 do you mind if i sit down ive had too much to drink to be standing here like this
1646281 i dont know your reasons for wanting to jump off the side of this here building im not going to make you tell me but what i am going to say is that we all hit low points where we want to end our lives in this country and in this day and age its becoming a regular thing
1646282 outlets dont make your problems go away they just distract you from them
1646283 i want the pain to stop forever i dont want to feel anymore
1646284 oh like that makes me feel any more secure ethan are you a total idiot
1646285 i mean ya were just about to leap over the edge of a thirteen story building
1646286 you make it sound so easy to just forget your problems and live a completely pointless existence how am i supposed to go on if every bit of will power inside of me is completely dead i have no heart for anything i dont see in color anymore i cant smile food has no taste the sky is always gray im banged and bruised everywhere mentally and physically
1646287 no trust me doll i know what its like to want to end it all im a white collar regular i work a dead end job five days a week and during my time off i drink myself into a stupor and hit up as many drugs as possible i guess im lucky i couldnt get a hold of any heroin tonight or else i probably wouldnt be up here right now
1646288 youve always gotten your way in life havent you probably a jock in high school probably dated the prettiest most intelligent girl in school got amazing grades and was friends with everyone right
1646289 except i got this job to support my perfect girlfriend and i because we were going to try and buy a house get married and have kids we actually got pregnant but she miscarried after seven months i guess part of her blamed me and she left ive been this way ever since its been about a year now
1646290 so you were with her for about seven years then
1646291 thats got to be rough always getting your way then all of the sudden getting it taken away i guess im lucky ive never had anything
1646292 my mom died with i was really small of a drug overdose so i grew up with my dad and he wasnt the greatest guy he dated disgusting women one in particular she was a drug addict and a drunk but i guess she loved my dad they tried to have a baby and when it wouldnt happen they went to the doctor and she found out she couldnt have kids after that she started beating me because it killed her to look at me my fathers daughter with another woman and it didnt help that im the spitting image of my mother
1646293 women go crazy when they cant have children of their own
1646294 or if theyre kids are taken away it sucks that you had to go through that
1646295 thats not even the half of it after her abusing me she finally got so sick of looking at me she left my father when i was fifteen he blamed me for it every second of every day until i was eighteen and could leave he did so much to try and hurt me mentally physically emotionally he tried to poison me a few times then when i moved out i took off with a guy i had been dating we lived together for a while he was never home he always ran around with other women and yelled at me when he was actually home he spent all of his money on liquor we never had food and were lucky if we made rent about three months ago i finally packed my shit and left after all these years ive done such terrible things to just get by i hate myself
1646296 molly id be lying if i said that things arent going to be rough life is hard it sucks but it cant rain all the time the sun has got to come up look i know how you feel before you came up here i was going to jump to my doom too actually i was in the same spot you were standing right there
1646297 having met you even though were strangers i feel like i have a little more to live for im not saying my life is better than yours by any means but i feel like ive learned that things could always be worse and i want to work to make them better i dont want to sound weird but i want to ask you something
1646298 i want you to spend some time with me maybe i can make you see things the way im seeing them now instead of leaping to your death keep me company please
1646299 alright but im only going to give you one night if you double cross me or hurt me in any way i swear to fucking god ill find my way up here and jump without a second of hesitation

1646304 tuhan engkau adalah seorang gembala yang baik dalam mazmur daud pun mengilustrasikan engkau sebagai gembala yang membawa domba domba mu ke padang rumput yang hijau daud pada masa mudanyapun adalah seorang gembala domba dan apa yang dia ungkapkan tentang engkau sebagai seorang gembala aku percaya bahwa daud pun menemukan hal hal ini ketika dia sedang menggembalakan dombanya tuhan engkau allah yang mengetahui segala sesuatu jadi kaloengkau ada pada posisiku apa yang akan engkau lakukan dalam menghadapi domba yang nakal ini
1646305 tuhan aku nggak tega tapi karena engkau yang suruh aku untukpatahkan kakinya maka aku akan patahkan kakinya
1646306 itulah yang tidak dimengerti oleh umat ku ketika aku membiarkan mereka berbeban berat atau terluka atau aku ijinkan sesuatu menimpa mereka itu adalah untuk membawa mereka mendekat kepada ku
1646307 the big attraction for me was that bangor is closer to home
1646308 the travelling was becoming an ordeal for me it was absolutely starting to grind at me and i wasnt enjoying it
1646309 i was eight and a half years up and down the frosses road and thank god unscathed i just felt that it was time to move on its a lot handier for me now at bangor
1646310 its a new challenge for me at bangor and its the type of challenge i like
1646311 i came through a lot at coleraine and i think i came out of it pretty well
1646312 i know i have left the club in a pretty good state and memories of a few irish cup finals albeit the one in may was a defeat but i have very fond memories of a club that i have a lot of time for and people that i have a lot of time for
1646313 like many things in life i move on and i have accepted the challenge from bangor and the challenge is to keep the club in the premiership
1646314 were not going to kid ourselves thats what its all about for us this season
1646315 the club is very enterprising and very supportive i couldnt ask for anything more
1646316 like everyone else in the league well be aiming for the top six but i see us being in the bottom four
1646317 it will be a good achievement if we stay in the division and i am confident we will but getting into that top six well that will require a miracle
1646318 i watched the ryder cup that year but i doubt if ill recognise much of it to be honest
1646319 ive heard the set up is tough and im looking forward to it im driving the ball well my iron play feels good and if i can get my short game sharp ill see whos around the next couple of days
1646320 i always like to try to seek out good players like that and see if i can pick their brains maybe someone who knows the course a little bit maybe one of the ryder cup players from a few years ago see if they can show me around a little bit
1646321 ive had a great few months of play my second best finish in a major and i walked away disappointed i simply played badly struggled on the saturday struggled on the greens a little bit
1646322 yet i walked away with my second best finish in a major and i learned i can compete at this level with the best players in the world at the best tournaments in the world
1646323 im really feeling my games getting better i hit the ball great at akron i really did coming off not really doing a whole lot last week just resting and trying to unscramble my mind a little bit for the second half of the season
1646324 im going in again the same way i was going into birkdale that ive got the game to compete
1646325 ive always talked about the short game being the key really to the majors and it is youve got to learn how to get the ball up and down on these fast greens
1646326 this survey highlights that some sectors of the housing market are experiencing appreciable rates of price decline though the overall picture when balanced out suggests that there has only been a 4 reduction
1646327 but the main impact on the market is in the volume of transactions which have been more than halved over the year
1646328 while a correction in the market is taking place it is important to stress that price levels have not collapsed and the marking down of prices appears to be incremental rather than a one off correction
1646329 the survey shows that price changes vary widely across different parts of northern ireland and across the types of properties so people should be cautious about making over simplistic judgments
1646330 for instance there are different factors affecting both the resale and the new build markets
1646331 there is no precedent in this region for what is happening in terms of a genuine housing cycle so we are on a journey through the unknown which itself is feeding the uncertainty
1646332 anyone looking for the green shoots of recovery should keep an eye on transaction levels which are likely turn before prices do but it might be a while

1646349 aku menghabiskan waktuku selama setahun untuk belajar bahasa isyarat hanya untuk memberitahukan kepadamu bahwa aku tidak melupakan janjiku kepadamu ijinkan aku menj adi suaramu aku mencintai kamu
1646350 pak maaf ya saya mau tanya ke bapak apakah bapak percaya kepada yesus
1646351 nah kalau begitu kita ini satu iman makanya saya mau cerita ke bapak
1646352 pak ini sebuah pengakuan kepada bapak saya tidak mengarang atau membuat buatnya hari ini sebelum menarik taksi saya berdoa kepada tuhan agar hari ini saya diberi rejeki karena dirumah beras sudah habis uang sekolah belum terbayar dan dua hari lagi akan ada kebaktian gereja di rumah saya tapi saya tidak punya uang sama sekali
1646353 saya keluar dari pagi sampai siang ini tidak ada satu penumpangpun yang naik taksi saya seolah olah taksi saya ini barang najis yang tidak mau disentuh orang bayangkan pak sudah lebih dari 4 jam saya keliling jakarta tapi tidak ada penumpang yang mau naik
1646354 saya bertanya kepada tuhan kenapa saya diberi cobaan seperti ini toh saya telah menjadi pengikutmu selama sepuluh tahun ini saya ini dilahirkan kembali baru 10 tahun lalu setelah dari kecil saya menyembang dewa kini saya percaya kepada yesus kristus
1646355 tapi kenapa ketika saya setia kok saya seperti ditinggalkannya dan dijauhkannya hari ini saya kalut dan pusing pak karena masalah dirumah otak saya buntu dan beku tidak tahu lagi bagaimana harus menghidupi keluarga saya
1646356 saya hari ini berpikiran ingin bunuh diri saja dengan menjatuhkan taksi ini dari atas jembatan layang tomang mungkin semua urusan saya beres saya tidak pusing lagi dan keluarga memperoleh uang dari asuransi
1646357 tapi hati kecil saya kok melarang hal itu dan teringat akan ayat yang mengatakan bahwa tuhan tidak akan menguji kita diluar kemampuan kita sayapun berkata kepada tuhan yesus
1646358 tuhan yesus jika engkau ada maka utuslah malaikatmu sekarang juga untuk menyelamatkan aku
1646359 doa itu saya ucapakan ketika berada di lampu merah otista iii bapak berdiri di halte pfn otista raya dan menghentikan taksi ini
1646360 makanya ketika bapak menghentikan taksi ini dan naik saya langsung teriak puji tuhan engkaulah malaikat tuhan yang diutus untukku
1646361 bapak telah diutus oleh tuhan yesus untuk menyelamatkan saya dari perbuatan nekat dan bodoh yaitu dengan bunuh diri setan itu jahat dan menyesatkan iman saya kepada tuhan yesus seolah olah tuhan yesus meninggalkan saya dan membiarkan saya menderita
1646362 semestinya saya ingat akan cerita di alkitab tuhan yesus sebagai gembala domba yang baik ia tak akan meninggalkan domba dombanya tersesat
1646363 pak kejadian ini akan saya jadikan kesaksian pada kebaktian dirumah

1646430 taxpayers have every reason to be angry with the private sector managers and directors who behaved appallingly and have never been brought to book the company auditors who passed last years accounts without spotting the big holes in the company books the regulators the fsa who also gave the northern rock a clean bill of health and the government which was at best naive and at worst dishonest when it claimed to have secured the governments loans
1646431 starcourse said to be fair to vince he did ask and was told that they were secured against high quality mortgages
1646432 the facts of life invariably turn out to be tory
1646433 to be fair to vince he did ask and was told that they were secured against high quality mortgages
1646434 otherwise intelligent mps like cable seem to lose the ability to see the obvious

1646465 the people are so glad they have this soccer field again
1646466 before the reopening it seemed like everywhere i went somebody would always mention it to me and tell me how excited they were about the reopening soccer brings everybody together regardless of their age
1646467 everyone thought the soccer field would only have a positive impact on the north precinct of ramadi but after it was renovated everyone from the city started coming over here
1646468 it was originally built for the north district but really its for everybody the reopening has been big for the entire city
1646469 we decided to open the soccer field during the summer because we wanted to get more teenagers and young people involved in some sort of extracurricular activity
1646470 we wanted the youth to have some type of positive activity to help prevent any insurgents from trying to get into their heads and reversing our recent gains
1646471 todays reopening of the soccer field wouldve been impossible two years ago
1646472 we were too scared to go anywhere we didnt know what security was because there wasnt any the security situation in ramadi is the only reason why were able to be here today

1646479 when you accidentally knock your laptop off the desk the accelerometer is detecting a large strong new motion
1646480 if theres just a few of them then the server will know its just people knocking their laptops around accidentally
1646481 but if were flooded with a large number of triggers then well know that there is a large significant earthquake in the area
1646482 if it is an earthquake we could potentially send out signals to those who need it even before the energy from the quake has expanded out from the epicentre to those other people
1646483 in california we train pupils in schools to jump underneath desks when theres an earthquake drill
1646484 the words of the wise are like goads and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings they are given by one shepherd my son beware of anything beyond these of making many books there is no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh

1646486 but as scary as the situation is fortunately thank god nobody was hurt it shows that the airlines were able to handle these things in an effective way

1646491 news of payment denial is tough enough for a terminally ill person to bear
1646492 imagine if the recipient had pinned his hope for survival on an unproven treatment or if this were the first time he understood the disease had entered the terminal phase the impact of such a letter would be devastating
1646493 but im opposed to the assisted suicide law i havent considered it even at my lowest point

1646498 it is harrowing to hear a child saying that if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on
1646499 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police if that hasnt been done that is exactly the kind of information that the private investigators are going to follow up
1646500 he concluded that the man was monitoring the movements near that path and into the apartment the man looked suspicious he was watching the apartment

1646513 they had to descend without any safety lines and in that descent we know that some climbers have slipped down and their whereabouts are unknown
1646514 moving river of ice broke loose like an iceberg breaking loose from a glacier

1646517 he was barricaded outside in a gangway where there were apartment buildings and residences surrounding the area he was firing multiple shots in the air at police at the helicopter at wherever

1646519 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1646520 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1646521 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1646522 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1646523 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions
1646524 ultimately only china can decide what course it will follow

1646533 theres potential promise that vitamin c is part of the armamentarium for treating some cancers
1646534 which ones weve got to do more and find out
1646535 the body wants to get to a certain place and no more
1646536 short circuiting the bodys normal control mechanisms and finding theres an unexpected surprise that may be beneficial
1646537 should patients with any kind of tumor go out and get iv ascorbate vitamin c thats not the message here
1646538 like so many things that are intriguing or appear to be promising there appears to be a long way to go from the theory in the lab to the practical application in the clinic

1646564 recent food riots in several countries have made chinese leaders realize even more than before that food security must be resolved internally
1646565 if food supply is dependent on imports then you can never guarantee social stability and even national sovereignty can be jeopardized it serves to explain the much harder line taken by china at the trade negotiations this time
1646566 before it opens its agricultural markets entirely china needs guarantees that it can rely on safeguard mechanisms to protect its own farm produce
1646567 in the face of the food price crisis it is ironic that the debate came down to how much and how fast nations could raise their barriers to imports of food
1646568 we are a new member of the wto and must still enjoy treatment as a new member
1646569 the collapse of the talks has nothing to do with china
1646570 after satisfying its own demands the us had demanded from the developing world a price as high as heaven
1646571 it is unfair to pitch wealthy farmowners of the west regularly subsidized by their countries finance ministries against the millions of unprotected small size farmers of china
1646572 farmers and agriculture are still the pillars of many developing countries economies in the west though peasants represent only a fraction of the population and agriculture accounts for only a small portion of the rich nations gdps
1646573 as the worlds most efficient grain producer whose exports account for 40 of the global grain exports the us is the biggest beneficiary of soaring food prices
1646574 the us has calculated rightly that high grain prices would offset the decrease in its agricultural subsides in fact last year the us spent only 9 billion on such subsidies
1646575 the pakistanis have been violating the ceasefire over the past few months but this is the first time since 1998 that pakistani troops have crossed the loc and fired on the indian positions
1646576 attempts are being made to ensure that the run up to the polls is not peaceful
1646577 the loc clashes are part of a calibrated pakistani army effort to ratchet up tensions on the loc
1646578 islamabad hopes a crisis on the loc will give it the pretext it needs to pull troops out of the north west frontier province
1646579 to deflect pressure and resist any american demands for an increase in force levels to undertake concerted counter terrorist operations in the federally administered tribal areas and along the border with afghanistan pakistan could be raising the bogey of deterioration in the situation and threat on its eastern border with india
1646580 stepping up the frequency and intensity of firing cross the loc pakistan has tested indias patience with the suicide attack on the indian embassy in the afghan capital kabul last month

1646585 march 14 is based on the principles of sovereignty democracy and self determination for lebanon
1646586 in light of what we have had to contend with in the last three years whether the assassinations mainly targeting march 14 members the sit in sabotage of the presidential election which was postponed for more than six months the may 7 coup d tat by hezbollah that led to the fighting and the current continuous obstruction process the fact that march 14 is still able to operate is a miracle
1646587 the cohabitation between the state and hezbollahs armed organization is rendering the march 14 mission of nation building impossible
1646588 hezbollahs weapons are tied to a regional strategy as witnessed in the recent speeches of iranian officials stressing that stability in lebanon palestine and iraq can only be achieved through an international agreement on irans nuclear dossier
1646589 we need to focus our slogans and approach on the problem of hezbollahs weapons

1646697 the best design historically is in magazine design and this is basically taking the best of magazine design and bringing it into the web
1646698 it doesnt compute because it flies in the face of everything ive learned is good for the internet
1646699 web design is an artifact of a limited set of tools
1646700 the best design historically is in magazine design and this is basically taking the best of magazine design and bringing it into the web
1646701 it looks like its just a straight replica of print
1646702 but actually there was a lot of back and forth here about how to design this and optimize it for the screen so that it had a lot of signals that were print like in terms of layout but for example theres no scrolling theres no up and down to below the fold or anything like that so its definitely an experiment
1646703 thats a good citizen of the web but pulls all of the style characteristics and style flexibility and high production values from print pages over into the web
1646704 we didnt know what to expect what the reception would be like how many people would get it how many would tell their friends about it

1646707 thats probably the biggest upside for us when were putting it out
1646708 we can say well if theres 10 trades we can do five pages of trade coverage tomorrow its just a matter of do we have the people to do it

1646716 the way talend is handling all their database operators is pretty horrible
1646717 we decided to move away from this by creating db specific input and ouput components eg tmysqlinput toracleoutput and this for one main reason rdbms are all different hence they present different features and a generic component wont allow us to use more features than the ones that are common to all rdbms
1646718 we have been involved with charities before but this is the first time we have officially approached a charity like this

1646721 we are very much looking forward to working together as each year we have to raise 1 million to provide the special care to our seriously ill children

1646730 i thought they were friends someone she could talk to and help her
1646731 i am satisfied on the brief of evidence that there is sufficient weight to support a conviction
1646732 they showed up at my door and told me that she had been arrested
1646733 shes very very upset shes not dealt with prison before
1646734 i guess ultimately i wish i had said something i say that only with the benefit of hindsight
1646735 mr pink your friend is already at the table she has been enjoying watching you wait
1646736 please sit down crystal ive already taken the liberty to oder our lunch so there is no need to look at a menu
1646737 thank you err maam how would you know what i wanted to have for lunch
1646738 oh crystal please dont call me maam makes me sound like i should either be in a retirement home or in charge of a brotel you may address me as ms snow in public if and when we alone there may be more appropriate ways for you to address me
1646739 yes ms snow but how did you know what i wanted for lunch
1646740 lets just say i knew you would want to eat anything and everthing i wanted you to eat so it was easy for me to know you will be a good gurl and eat what i want you to have right
1646741 so tell me crystal are you sexually arosed and hard right now
1646742 how could anyone having lunch with a beauty like you not be excited
1646743 how nice to say crystal and i am glad your excited it will help you finish your lunch
1646744 crystal you may not have noticed but when that cute waitress brought our salads she also brought our salad dressing on the side but look the white cup holding your dressing is empty while mine has a very appealing ranch dressing dont you wonder why
1646745 no ms snow i did not notice that perhaps she made a mistake im sure i can ask for some salad dressing so it should not be a problem
1646746 true it is not a problem but you need not embarrace the waitress by asking for salad dressing after all she is a woman and unlike you she does not make mistakes i think we can find another method for you to get some salad dressing without interuppting our waitress dont you
1646747 well good point ms snow i guess we can share your ranch dressing that way we would not disturb the waitress
1646748 oh no gurl that would not work why should i be deprived of some of my salad dressing when you are the one without any can you think of any other way by the way is crystal still excited
1646749 another great point ms snow you should not be deprived and yes i am very aroused but i also have no clue on how to get salad dressing without asking the waitress or the hostess
1646750 well it seems simple to me little gurl lets look at the facts shall we first you agreed you should eat whatever i wanted you to eat second you currently have no dressing but you do have an empty container and thrid your so sexual arroused you can not think straight it seems simple to me do you see a way so that all the facts create a solution yet
1646751 well sissy shall we ask the couple at the next table what they think of your situation or perhaps if you ask me nicely i will tell you what you need to do but becareful if you ask me you will be obliagted to follow my instruction than again asking the next couple will require yourself to introduce yourself as crystal the submissive sissy
1646752 ms snow please help me by telling me the solution to my current problem of not having any salad dressing i promise i will do as you tell me i really appreciate any help you can give me
1646753 very good crystal yes you poor gurl i can and will help but there is a rule if you do not do as your told we will never meet again nor will we ever chat online again understood

1646779 what did you like about our program in spite of not purchasing it
1646780 well what would you say if we could offer you the entire 30 weeks for a one time payment of 1000
1646781 bill gives me a folder with the holy grail in it contract voucher for three nights hotel stay good for one year and a 300 gas voucher which turns out is only doled out 25 at a time per 100 in reciepts sent in per month
1646782 refrain from having an orgasm with specific instruction to do so from mistress
1646783 oh woe is me we only grew by 1 last quarter instead of our target 7 this is poverty on an african scale
1646784 oh yeah it totally has a point there is this lady on a boat and you totally get to know her its got an amazing story
1646785 how about jeff minter the guy who threw a sissy fit because a good game sold more than his crappy hippy fest rip off of tempest
1646786 hurrr hurrr i like this game you should buy it 11 10
1646787 eugh i didnt like this game avoid it 3 10 insert hilarious derogatory and useless comments for cheap laughs
1646788 we might talk about the ending just a heads up
1646789 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and finance needs
1646790 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1646791 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1646792 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1646793 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1646794 to assume were going to pay for it all is just wrong
1646795 nonetheless the pace of spending has been held back by various factors including deficiencies in capacity and security
1646796 morgan is doing well after his surgery last night to reconnect nerves and repair damage in his left arm and hand the surgery last night lasted four and a half hours hes visiting with family this morning as of this morning hes up and walking around and looking forward to his release in a few days

1646800 i hope you enjoy this painting as much as i enjoyed creating it
1646801 i hope you appreciate how much back pain and nipple soreness i endured to make this painting
1646802 actresses like me might be asked to play more stereotyped roles
1646803 you have to respect other peoples culture customs and needs its a delicate situation
1646804 im not just a white face with brown hair and blue eyes
1646805 youre always a foreigner you can never break out and become one of them
1646806 i want to make the western character a real person
1646807 even if they start as a stereotype i have the power to try to change it

1646810 s ections of the book pulse with sexual energy maguire keeps the prose crackling and the dialogue lively from the first page to the last

1646812 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in
1646813 are people actually doing it i really find it hard to believe
1646814 gives you time to make arrangements and take care of your personal matters
1646815 it is a way for you to plan your return home
1646816 we understand the impact it has on them when we knock on their doors early in the morning and take them out of their homes
1646817 they dont want their children to go through the trauma of being arrested in the morning
1646818 noted by ice as a factor in your immigration records
1646819 for anyone to say no one will do it thats absolutely wrong
1646820 this person back in your jail is now a person of interest in our investigation of that case
1646821 one of the things we are going to try to determine is is he chichester
1646822 those people would inadvertently give false information to cover his tracks
1646823 we cant even verify that he is a united states citizen
1646824 get a fair trial when the police department is leaking all this to the press
1646825 i was actually thrilled because i thought well good maybe theyve got some kind of lead and it would be nice to find out what the mystery is after all these years
1646826 we were never able to pin anything down on him never were really able to figure out where he came from what he had done he was one of these people that kind of appeared and then disappeared and no one seemed to know anything about him
1646827 she always believed he was alive and she didnt understand why he didnt write
1646828 surfaces in affluent neighborhoods and mingles in social circles by making friends with wealthy influential people
1646829 pass up wall street jobs and go to chicago instead
1646830 i think that back in the 60s and 70s a lot of the way we regulated industry was top down command and control
1646831 and i think that the republican party and people who thought about the markets came with the notion that you know what if you simply set some guidelines some rules and incentives for businesses let them figure out how theyre going to for example reduce pollution
1646832 it was natural for me to be interested in international affairs
1646833 a specialist in international development who was one of the early practitioners of microfinancing helping women buy a loom or a sewing machine or a milk cow to be able to enter into the economy
1646834 i thought that he was going to be a novelist or something like that
1646835 he seemed like the type of person who was observing the world and taking it in
1646836 he had a good profile for business international bright articulate a good writer and a knowledge of world issues and affairs
1646837 like a spy behind enemy lines i arrived every day at my mid manhattan office and sat at my computer terminal checking the reuters machine that blinked bright emerald messages from across the globe
1646838 sometimes coming out of an interview with japanese financiers or german bond traders i would catch my reflection in the elevator doors see myself in a suit and tie a briefcase in my hand and for a split second i would imagine myself as a captain of industry
1646839 they were boosters for multinationals and they thought globalism was the way we should be going
1646840 if youre just working on the technical financial points the social implications are out of the question
1646841 youre just dealing with how am i getting my money from here to there
1646842 made some comment like there should be a boycott of any company doing business there
1646843 i said he needed to realize that its the non south african companies who were hiring blacks and giving them positions of authority with decent pay thats what accelerates change not isolation
1646844 he always seemed aloof a little bit of a stray cat
1646845 i remember telling him he was making a big mistake
1646846 he let me know he had bigger fish to fry
1646847 he believed in markets and he believed in competition but he didnt believe the market was a level playing field
1646848 obama is pro market and he has a keen understanding of what free markets do and of the needs and value of business
1646849 barack obamas views on the american economy and the global marketplace were shaped by a variety of experiences
1646850 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1646851 the government will have an uphill battle to prove their allegations
1646852 the sheer number of retailers attacked by these cyber criminals demonstrates the much broader challenges in protecting sensitive consumer data from this increasing threat
1646853 broader action beyond retailers alone is required to protect consumer data banks and the us payment card industry must join retailers and work together
1646854 there are thousands of conduits to customer data security isnt working and tjx is the poster child of a big data breach
1646855 what is needed is a different approach to secure that data far more directly where it lives
1646856 we instituted significant system upgrades and we are continuously employing measures to help protect data against the ever increasing sophistication of thieves
1646857 the message is simply this we will track you down wherever you are in the world
1646858 we will see that you are arrested and you will go to jail
1646859 middle school students motivations are different and the mcas is not high stakes for them like it is for high school students
1646860 if middle school students are having a bad day it totally throws off their test scores
1646861 the state should pay more attention to the middle school level
1646862 often middle school is a critical transition for students from the more protective environment of an elementary school to the more complex social and academic challenges of a secondary school
1646863 i dont like to play games i just like to learn i need to improve in math and english
1646864 there has been longstanding confusion of what the focus of middle schools should be
1646865 if we want to compete with the rest of world and if we want kids to succeed they need to learn at high levels and having these few years of hitting the pause button has been disastrous
1646866 kids at this age need a lot of structure and unconditional love and people to be tough on them
1646867 you cant go after kids with extra mcas help all the time
1646868 but eventually you stop making excuses and start being honest and reflecting its hard to admit things could be better
1646869 as soon as he saw there was no foundation that nothing had been done at all he started vomiting
1646870 sometimes the people from the church used to disagree but now they dont say anything
1646871 asif ali zardari and nawaz sharif at tuesdays meeting discussed the issue of restoration of judges and other political matters but i cannot go into details
1646872 that this cant be a crime because heavenly father is the one that tells jeffs when a girl is ready to get married and that he is only following the word of heavenly father
1646873 were familiar with many of the local drivers those we havent seen before get checked with the computer
1646874 fortunately weve avoided major surgery and expect him back in training in the next six to eight weeks you never know the full story until you go into the knee thats why weve been open in terms of the prognosis but its great news for everyone at the club kenwyne is a big player for us

1646877 they have abandoned us they dont understand the depths of our true love but weve got each other
1646878 what the heck was i thinking and why didnt i listen

1646880 as for you you were dead in your transgressions and sins in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world

1646882 we have reached our time limit to find a solution that would help us keep the fury servers open
1646883 sadly no solution has been found and so we have no alternative than to shut the servers down in 48 hours
1646884 to the auran team who put their heart and soul into making fury thanks for your efforts as i said many times before we need to be much better than the competition to have a chance of succeeding we gave it everything we had and history now judges that it still wasnt good enough
1646885 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation state employees are facing pay cuts californias services are being scaled back and anxiety is rising in sacramento to find funds
1646886 rather than tackling real problems affecting californians they chose to waste time money and state resources it is shameful that legislators pursued personal agendas in spite of the facts
1646887 caregivers are not well served by court battles and legal fees rather they would have been far better off if state officials worked together with our industry to raise awareness about videogame ratings and the parental controls available on all new game consoles both of which help ensure that the games children play are parent approved

1646910 having been poor is no shame but being ashamed of it is
1646911 i have always thought that the congestion charge is a blunt instrument it has proved successful in cutting traffic coming into london but on its own has not resolved the problem of congestion various works and schemes going on in the capital have also eroded its impact i am therefore introducing a more comprehensive approach to easing congestion in london
1646912 congestion would be a lot worse were it not for the charge
1646913 tfl needs to manage the roadworks better which is plainly possible traffic lights can also be rephased by giving less green time to pedestrians and more to traffic
1646914 without the congestion charge the traffic problems in london would be much worse however as a result of other interventions such as utility and construction works the reduction in road space has had a detrimental impact on congestion levels and is slowing traffic down
1646915 belarus and russia are contained by the treaty of 1994 on withdrawal of nuclear weapons from belarus where the united states is the guarantor no one may breach the nuclear free treaty but the issues related to missile defense could be considered
1646916 it could be potential stationing of iskander missile systems in belarus potential deployment of strategic bombers in belarus kaliningrad etc
1646917 it will be possible to discuss all these actions after the united states inks a treaty with poland after it various actions of response but for the nuclear weapons supplies could be taken

1646920 i had always been interested in the environment and i heard that invasive plants are a threat to native plants in natural areas and by removing them there are spaces for the native plants to grow
1646921 i heard that one of the societys main goals was to protect native plants
1646922 we connected with joshuas project right away because it was so close to our organizations mission he was making conservation and environmental awareness fun beautiful and satisfying he tied together communities and ideas and had the creativity and leadership to carry it out
1646923 he brought many people with complementary values together for example joshua auctioned off a membership to the society as a fundraiser at the acton oktoberfest and with the proceeds was able to include even more plants
1646924 even though these plants may seem attractive and some people would like to use them in dried flower arrangements new england wild flower society urges you to avoid them too often birds carry the fruits right off wreaths and garlands or the fruits end up in landfills where they resprout these plants create severe environmental damage in many parts of the country they invade open fields forests wetlands meadows and even your own backyard aggressively killing off whatever plants are nearby bittersweet can even kill mature trees both plants are extremely difficult to control when they are cut off they quickly resprout

1646931 when she wasnt out at nightclubs she was taking acting classes we dated for only a few months but in that period i spent a lot of time with her and her friends whose behavior intrigued and appalled me to such an extent that i ended up basing a novel on the experience
1646932 most of the guys i know have really high powered jobs and make up for lost time when theyre not in the office

1646934 full commercial legalization of cannabis on the model now applied to alcohol would vastly increase the cannabis abuse problem by giving the marketing geniuses who have done such a fine job persuading children to smoke tobacco drink to excess and super size themselves another vice to foster
1646935 these experiences were of pure positive happiness when all doubts all fears all inhibitions all tensions all weaknesses were left behind now self consciousness was lost all separateness and distance from the world disappeared as if they felt one with the world fused with it really belonging in it and to it instead of being outside looking in

1646947 it was clear that they had been targeted and followed back to school we are very grateful that the body of the school was largely unaware and unaffected

1646956 is it a coincidence that the hitman got money from lived with and went out with people tied to rade kotur or his company
1646957 it is a lie when he said during questioning that he was afraid for rade kotur and that only a fool only someone with no brains wouldnt be afraid

1646991 i like steve and what he brings to the team hes had his ups and downs but i have a really good relationship with steve he seems as excited as anything and he had a bit of a bounce in his step i like steve in the side coach peter moores and i are singing from the same hymn sheet at the moment its all positive
1646992 and they now understand that it wasnt in the best judgement
1646993 upon realising how what theyd done had been perceived by the host nation
1646994 when you train your whole life for something dot all your is and cross all your ts why wouldnt you be better safe than sorry they have pollution in los angeles and if the olympics were in los angeles we would probably wear these masks too
1646995 and we would not forbid athletes from wearing masks if they felt it was in their best interests to do so
1646996 obviously we have to balance their right to do what they want with how those actions are perceived
1646997 you never want to go to someones house and cause embarrassment and in this case i think they did

1647007 i havent been to the venue as everything is locked down due to the typhoon but the way the stables work it is very enclosed and the horses are unlikely to hear anything outside
1647008 we have been told the typhoon will be downgraded to level three later this afternoon and if that is the case and we can still ride this evening then we wont really have lost anything training wise
1647009 you cant do anything about it but its something that happens and affects everybody im not too bothered about it because i could do with the day off
1647010 we cant leave the hotel because when theres a typhoon at this level 8 all the transport is cancelled so unfortunately we are all holed up in a hotel its similar to a hurricane and its not as bad as it has been but its torrential rain and high winds we are right by the coast so the sea is very rough
1647011 athletes that are flying in tonight have been booked into accommodation in hong kong overnight
1647012 were hopeful of getting some athletes out tonight up to beijing but if not theyll go tomorrow

1647015 for the lighting of the flame the last torch bearer this is the most secretive part and will be revealed at the very last moment
1647016 we hope and believe the athletes in the olympic games know they should not link the olympic games with politics
1647017 it would run against the charter of the olympics and the spirit of the olympic movement

1647020 people who dont normally owe taxes will get a check from the government and they might have great difficulty paying it back
1647021 they might get hit with interest and penalties for failure to pay back this check they got

1647023 most mortgages made between the fall of 2004 and the fall of 2007 the majority of them are underwater
1647024 what the current housing market needs is more sales more transactions and a return to liquidity with normal moving and mobility
1647025 this coupled with continued low new construction will reduce the inventory of unsold units and allow prices to stabilize and then recover

1647035 ill give it my best shot but i really dont know what to expect
1647036 the opera is unlike the movies they boo ive been disliked but from a distance but this is different
1647037 i still dont know how it will play out with this one
1647038 they showed me some footage but i dont have a feel for the movie i didnt see enough i wasnt sure who the terminator was i dont know if there is one or if hes the star or the hero these are the things that determine the success and how strong the movie will be
1647039 ive seen very little footage so i dont really have a feel for it
1647040 i hope they do well and i hope it is a huge hit i do hope it creates a spectacle on the screen that is what james cameron created

1647046 only 40 to 50 per cent of motorcyclists in rural areas use their helmets compared with 90 per cent in urban areas of this only a third use their helmets correctly

1647051 already an experienced and established hairstylist who has over 100 outlets in india has been engaged to provide training for the youths
1647052 youths from india will be in malaysia for about one to two months for practical training in similar courses
1647053 the ministry will also provide other forms of training for youths interested in going into the food hotel or catering industry
1647054 we want them to be professional chefs at food outlets or restaurants which are now being monopolised by cooks from india
1647055 we also put forward a proposal to najib for all indian trade bodies including goldsmiths tourist operators news agency associations barber associations and metal traders to be registered and placed under the chamber
1647056 the problem we now face is that most of these bodies are not registered so it is difficult for us to assist foreign workers who are victimised by their employers
1647057 climate change is making agriculture especially in developing countries unpredictable and unproductive
1647058 and yet deforestation and destruction of water sources continues unabated especially in poor commonwealth countries
1647059 the key word is partnership how to forge partnerships between various world blocs and agencies calls for full commitment by both developed and developing countries
1647060 individual and joint country challenges particularly through parliaments must be undertaken to invest in agriculture together with the research that goes with it
1647061 parliaments and parliamentarians are at the heart of the democratic process however one of the great problems we face in so many places is how to get the animosity the antagonism and the conflicts out of politics
1647062 my personal observation of the cpa and how it conducts itself is very similar to a democratic government that i know of very well
1647063 that is the malaysia government if malaysia is a multi racial multi cultural and a multi religious country and very successful at that so is the cpa

1647090 wah you dont look like your avatar must change it
1647091 a few of our athletes did wear masks as they came through the airport
1647092 those athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf they now realize and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organizing committee
1647093 i understand that about 200 of our athletes received those masks through the national governing body not directly from the u s olympic committee
1647094 we walked for nearly two hours inside the hole but returned after we didnt find the end of the tunnel
1647095 we also found a pond nearly the size of a room after walking for five minutes below the chautara

1647127 the irish wake in the sense of celebrating at a death originated with the ancient celts in their belief system once someone died in this world they moved on to the afterlife which was a better world and thus cause for celebration though it is a time of sadness the presence of friends and family makes it more bearable and there is generally great joviality as the deceased is fondly remembered
1647128 generally the wake is seen as the celebratory gathering after the funeral ceremony where people might share stories of the deceased over food and drink but most importantly to give the people a day to remember the person and to show their love of them
1647129 music dancing and physical games made the wake feel more like a party indeed there is tradition in some parts of the country to play a game of cards and include a hand for the deceased

1647142 the cost of living is crazy right now with two kids gas prices and rent im living paycheck to paycheck

1647145 its important to understand that if a young woman walks into a clinic and says she wants to be an egg donor the clinic doesnt just sit down and say sure and hand them money
1647146 there are national guidelines its a tightly orchestrated stringent process

1647157 fantastic arachnobatics cool action over the top fight scenes drama humor and a variety of awesome supervillains
1647158 ive come very close to writing spidey over the years but im eager to sit down with the real deal i find that peters voice comes very naturally to me spideys one of the marvel characters whose voice is so familiar to me that i can hear it in my head as i type
1647159 we had such a good creative relationship at that last place he worked that following him to marvel was an easy choice to make id have written captain ultra stories for the man but luckily he offered me the web slinger himself
1647160 theres a vitality to peter and his supporting cast that i dont think has been felt in years the sense that anything could happen has been reawakened i sat down to dinner with writers bob gale and marc guggenheim half of the spidey brain trust a few weeks ago and were gonna work together well ive been a fan of bob gales for most of my life and guggenheim is irritatingly talented given the brevity of his comics resume it took me twice as long to get half that good
1647161 my favorite new character is carlie the hot nerd girl crime solver no shock there
1647162 but no one in the marvel universe holds a dearer part of my heart than j jonah jameson
1647163 thats the amazing part of the amazing spider man he wont surrender no matter what personal or professional cruelty the universe is flinging at him that day the day to day catastrophes visited upon peter are as often hilarious as they are tragic the first spider man story i ever read made me laugh because his big problem that day was that he had a bad cold that was awesome that i could relate to struggling to enlarge the bottle city of kandor not so much
1647164 all i want is for the fans to be entertained
1647165 there have probably been more great stories told about spider man than about any other marvel character so thats quite a legacy to live up to as a writer but with the help of steve the brain trust and the awe inspiring artists in the spidey stable i think we can hold our heads up high
1647166 it is the best we could do we could not find live vines or handmade ornaments

1647173 i need to share some images on the web and blog about it
1647174 its a cold story with a new type of enemy for spidey
1647175 between zebs unique voice and chriss always breathtaking and groundbreaking work this is the month that many fans have been waiting for most and they wont be disappointed
1647176 i think its a brilliant idea to have a character that reflects on todays use of the internet and the youtube phenomenon as a means of self promotion
1647177 my artistic approach is always the same to find the concept behind the character and then make it both clean and clear and as visually exciting as possible
1647178 i thought we needed to showcase her name in the uniform as a brand image i drew influence from different brands of womens sportswear and also from the momo design brand of motorcycle helmets
1647179 they keep spidey on his toes and we have a great time coming up with them also by using new guys we can build up a little suspense for when the classic spidey villains come back and that day is fast approaching
1647180 shes funny kinetic and a bit of a trickster so out of everyone in world the person shes most like is spidey himself
1647181 im never thrilled by my work but im reasonably happy with the way spidey and screwballs chase scene turned out
1647182 working with spidey is going to be a fat bag of awesome
1647183 spidey is one of the characters who has been close to my heart since i was a kid
1647184 and that webspinners arc was too quick and too long ago it was an old school story where pete was still in high school so even though a lot of the familiar faces are back this is pete in a very different time in his life new challenges the brand new day shake up etc
1647185 its a more complicated set of issues facing him now although theres always going to be a part of him checking his breath whenever he talks to a pretty girl yknow
1647186 i try to hit every character i work on by breaking them down to their unassailable components
1647187 then i put back together whatevers left via my twisted sensibilities that way you can protect what makes a character special but then exploit the rest by bouncing them off your own fears hopes dreams loves hates etc at least thats the theory from that i usually find an unexplored angle
1647188 but kravens last hunt is bad ass on so many levels i also love mysterios appearances and as a kid i read the stories about gwens return via the jackal both of those messed with petes head in very different ways anything that makes spider man think hes insane is cool
1647189 and lest we forget spidey taught the beyonder how to poo nice
1647190 if you play in this country live in this country and you grow up in the heartland and you put on a russian uniform you are not a patriotic person in my mind
1647191 i stopped praying for god to put me on that u s team
1647192 and i just said show me very clearly where you want me to go what you want me to do open doors shut doors ill go whichever way you open
1647193 it was in my contract to say would you agree if such and such plays out you would play for our national team it wasnt until december or january of this year that i started seriously thinking about it
1647194 rather than starting with a core and working our way out we decided wed start with a larger national team be as inclusive as possible because of everyones overseas commitments then select the team closer to olympic time
1647195 our position is that she has every right to do exactly what she did
1647196 in her opinion she didnt have a shot to make our team so she went with the russian contract not every player was offered that opportunity i know it was a difficult decision for her
1647197 i wish i had the opportunity i wish i had been given the opportunity will you come play with us from usa basketball and russia saying well pay you 20 million to play for us and watch what decision i would have made watch i would have loved to have been given that opportunity that would just settle any money any patriotic dispute
1647198 so you know shes gonna do some damage shes also very young and very motivated
1647199 theres never been a spidey villain like her which isnt easy to say after so many decades of stories
1647200 no less skilled or deadly but certainly a lot more prone to taking risks and shooting from the hip
1647201 itll be like someone faced with an enemy whose only goal is to torture him in the most painful him in the most painful prolonged way possible
1647202 like i said spideys never had a teenage girl come after him with such a dark sinister vengeance before
1647203 i thought wow now i know why ive always wanted to work with phil jimenez
1647204 not that i didnt know before of course but phils work on this arc has been so jaw dropping amazing that it just confirms all my instincts in wanting to work with him
1647205 he brings so much to the table the whole arc has this really cinematic quality to it phil packs so much in i think people will be amazed how much story we tell over three issues

1647212 dear pig are you willing to sell for one shilling your ring
1647213 by claiming he was an authorized agent of the school making a purchase on behalf of the school
1647214 i was trying to help this community and these kids
1647215 i wasnt even coaching at the school at the time
1647216 for 18 months no one has asked me one question theyve just been out to punish
1647217 how do you have a grand jury investigation and not ask the person any questions
1647218 why are you trying to get me to leave office
1647219 from my point of view the suit is frivolous and a waste of taxpayers money were in a tight time and theyre playing games with this kind of nonsense
1647220 i just cant believe it prince was a nice woman
1647221 she the stabber was never right in the head she used to sit up all night on that one bench and just stare
1647222 i ran and got a shirt and gloves put the shirt on her wound and applied pressure
1647223 i told her to squeeze my hand which she did but she was in and out of consciousness
1647224 they pulled him out and he had a brown leather jacket on and pair of black pants that looked like they were falling down and he had blood on the jacket and he was handcuffed
1647225 they were always very friendly very quiet neighbors the lady was very nice the twin girls were very cute
1647226 my mother and i couldnt believe what happened because we heard nothing
1647227 you would think three people being stabbed we would have heard something because it is so quiet around here
1647228 she tried very hard with him and she would never give up on him
1647229 she probably could have had him admitted to a hospital or a home but she just kept trying with him she would never give up on him and we feared for her life
1647230 my primary purpose was to say thank you for the work that youve done to provide additional encouragement and support
1647231 i respect them i appreciate them i want them to be safe in doing their jobs i want them to be respected by the public
1647232 just because a couple people did some really bad things some horrible things some outrageous things the rest of our dhs workers should not be painted with a negative brush
1647233 maybe the language was a little vivid but as a parent and as a city worker and as a worker at dhs i feel the same way
1647234 you want to see the passion from the person in charge under no circumstances should someone die on your watch
1647235 he needs to see us as the professionals we are he needs to see that were risk takers we risk our lives every day we go places where police wont go
1647236 i think hes willing to help us become a better agency i think he knows weve made a lot of strides
1647237 every time a mayor comes in and theres a scandal they say they will fix things
1647238 always use the selected program to open this kind of file
1647239 new search engine cuil has opened to the public and with it the requisite comparisons and challenges to google former employer of cuils engineering team
1647240 he had blood coming from everywhere i just held him and told him to get up but he wouldnt get up
1647241 he was only 4 and he was trying to run to his mommy
1647242 i told my kids all my time keep your kids where you at
1647243 my daughter lived there so they figured they were safe this is the worst area
1647244 he just had an ignorant attitude but i never talked to him i just knew him by seeing him
1647245 i dont understand why he did what he did he saw my son i know he saw my son
1647246 i lay there staring at my kids all damn night long its messed up to say but i was just thankful i knew where everybody was and everybody was ok
1647247 she didnt want to be here from the beginning but she didnt have a choice for her pocketbook
1647248 mommy im too hot to brush my teeth youll have to do it
1647249 mommy can i please may i sleep in my undies and nothing else tonight its too hot
1647250 mommy its too hot in here can you turn the cold air on
1647251 mommy i cant feel any coldness are you sure its on
1647252 mommy its not helping wahhhh i cant go to sleep im too sticky make it colder
1647253 wahai tsalabah mengapa engkau berkelakuan seperti orang munafik tergesa gesa kamu keluar
1647254 ya rasullulah saya tergesa gesa ini adalah kerana kain yang saya pakai ini kain ini sajalah yang ada pada saya isteri saya tidak berpakaian apabila saya balik dia akan memakai kain saya untuk mengejarkan solat oleh itu mohonlah pada allah s w t untuk saya agar allah memberi rezeki kepada saya
1647255 with 48 hours i wanted to explore what it was to be an emotionally wounded and very confused teenager who suddenly finds himself in possession of incredible powers who in memory of his uncle wants to become a genuine hero
1647256 but of course wanting to be a hero and actually being a hero are two very different things
1647257 hes not the confident quipping spider man we know hes a grieving scared kid trying to make sense of a world thats been turned inside out
1647258 just because peter can suddenly climb walls and swing over bridges doesnt mean hes not afraid of heights just because he has the ability to run into a burning building and save lives doesnt mean the very idea of doing that doesnt scare him half to death
1647259 those are the elements that made writing this story interesting picking up the threads of peters story the morning after bens murder really allowed me to explore those elements to see peter in a new light
1647260 in many ways the heart and soul of the spider man mythos is family
1647261 despite the fact that uncle ben died in the very first spidey story he is perhaps preview art by
1647262 without ben and may the orphaned peter would have evolved into a very different person and spider man would have been a very different and i think much darker hero
1647263 he did a beautiful job with this story and id be delighted to work with him again
1647264 its got excitement emotion action i have such love for this book
1647265 curt conners has changed into the lizard and spider man has to stop him
1647266 in the course of the story pete and mary jane learn that the connors family is sick unfortunately the formula that can cure them may also present a danger to reptiles that live in the everglades the creatures that compose the lizards family
1647267 since yes pete and mary jane are no longer and never were married in the real marvel universe former editor molly lazer suggested that this series take place in the mc 2 universe and that i was the logical choice to write it
1647268 the first mr and mrs spider man story will eventually have an impact on the ongoing spider girl saga
1647269 the second story which will appear in amazing spider man family 2 actually shows the origin of a villain that is currently appearing in amazing spider girl and will help explain some of this persons motivations
1647270 in spider girl continuity amazing spider man family story occurs between the time that baby mayday was returned to the parkers and when pete lost his leg while battling the green goblin
1647271 in classic spider man continuity it occurs roughly between amazing spider man 436 and 440 but none of that really matters were going to assume that our readers arent familiar with either continuity well give you all the information you need and make these stories totally accessible to new readers
1647272 mayday and her dad have an awkward lunch together and darkdevil makes his first appearance
1647273 moose mansfield risks his life to save jimmy yama up until this issue the readers just assumed that moose was your typical big bully this scene showed them there was a lot more to the big guy and johnny storm and pete get together
1647274 pete and mayday team up for the very first time
1647275 mayday travels back in time and meets aunt may and her teenaged father
1647276 spider girl faces of against kaine and no one refers to the dreaded c saga
1647277 stinger and spider girl have some fun and get lectured by the man called nova
1647278 peter parker gets back into costume and spider girl teams with her dad
1647279 pete doesnt approve of his daughters date the grandson of j jonah jameson or her dress for a school dance where funny face and bunky make an appearance
1647280 maybe meets another super powered teenager and suddenly realizes that her spider powers are giving her an unfair advantage on the basketball court
1647281 mike got this gig just by being an artist ive liked for a long time i dropped an e mail to him out of the blue he got back to me and we worked out the secrets behind the comics folks
1647282 mikes working with bob gale in a story that explores the world of the bookie and his underground supervillain betting parlor
1647283 its also got coney island and bumper cars so its got all the ingredients ya need for a good spider man story
1647284 other than character and location consistency i dont want to create a house style for the book
1647285 with 36 of these issues every year theres plenty of room for artists to come in and show us what they would do with the character spidey is such a classic character because he lends himself to so many differing interpretations and i dont want to fight against that
1647286 it was teen titans but then i saw his first spidey cover 562
1647287 i may be biased but man is he good on spider man
1647288 this is your brain this is your brain on drugs and this is you and your brain on drugs and curt connors animal stem cells
1647289 amados maestros est n siendo activados muchos disparadores temporales o de eventos en el interior del n cleo del sagrado coraz n de la humanidad y en el

1647291 caused a serious disruption in the flow of powder and crack cocaine
1647292 it cannot be overstated that brandon is a tragically innocent victim
1647293 lindsey came to this neighborhood armed with a deadly weapon and a despicable lack of regard for the consequences of his actions
1647294 he was just riding around it wasnt like he was hiding it
1647295 this could have been avoided if the police had done their job
1647296 it wasnt until i was in college that i began dealing with the enormity of what happened and was ready to take on the fight for what was right and just
1647297 my wife carole and i had a 15 minute private meeting with president bush we made a decision that we wanted something to happen
1647298 does it bring us one step closer to what we wanted to accomplish yes do we still want to know all of those who were responsible yes
1647299 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims
1647300 now these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve
1647301 many positive things have been accomplished since 1988 better air security improvements with first responders and support for other families affected by terrorist acts
1647302 but every day i miss my brother and all the positive things dont change that my children will grow up without an uncle
1647303 were coming up on the 20th anniversary and id like the whole thing to be over
1647304 its been grueling and frustrating but weve survived because we have each other to lean on
1647305 is still on the surface and will be with us the rest of our lives
1647306 have been a trial for us to get justice we dont want revenge we want the facts out we want to know why it happened and mete out punishment
1647307 i never knew how much it would hurt at first i never knew how painful it would be to have to stop
1647308 i really enjoyed drawing the sandman arc in friendly neighborhood spider man 17 19 it was great to have spider man and sandman team up as hero and villain to rescue sandmans dad from being wrongfully executed on death row
1647309 i liked drawing black costume i started reading comics right when he got it in secret wars 8 so it holds some sentimental value to me sandman was a lot of fun to draw with his morphing abilities and sandy texture
1647310 i appreciated that these stories really allowed supporting cast to shine flash thompson and betty brants date really stands out in my mind from issue 18 we also got to set up some things to wrap up the whole the other
1647311 holy moses my storys got john romita jr art how cool is that
1647312 so with this i wanted to write a love story and i wanted to touch on all these amazing women events and periods of spideys life especially as i might never get the shot again to see gwen stacy in the coffee bean mary jane in that dress the near miss the first kiss i wanted to play with all the toys in the toy box
1647313 a reference explained peters joke with his mix tape about the nova special about rhinos the first date peter and mj ever went on they saw the rhino on a rampage amazing spider man v1 43
1647314 if i was spider man id eat lunch on top of the chrysler building every single day
1647315 this comic was nominated for an eisner award this year i couldnt be more flattered
1647316 its about hammerheads origins why he glommed onto the capone style persona in the first place beyond a few wicked bumps to the head
1647317 i wanted to dissect him as a character to build an argument for his possibly moving into a different role one better suited for his particular talents
1647318 lets just say that someone considers hammerhead a person of interest and would rather not see him retire to that great tommy gun repair shop in the sky
1647319 plus its incredible what you can do with plastic surgery these days
1647320 five seconds into a conversation with them can tell how psyched everyone is to be working on the book and they have a million ideas i knew it was going to be a fantastic experience that first night in the barracks when dan slott and marc guggenheim held down my blanket and steve wacker hit me with a sock full of scarlet spider busts i felt really loved
1647321 add bachalo to the mix and it was a done deal for me
1647322 they have similar m o s swinging around the city and you cant say that for a lot of the other marvel heroes spidey might team up with
1647323 usually spideys pairing with someone whos much different than him in terms of tone and demeanor and it often reduces him to just spinning webs and making quips dds powers and abilities while not in spideys weight class help make for a good partnership
1647324 the relationship takes an odd turn when spidey comes to daredevil in amazing spider man 566 asking for a big favor
1647325 dd has something that spidey needs something he lost at the end of the previous issue
1647326 it is very very unconventional daredevil helps spidey in a way that weve never seen before
1647327 i think this year marks a decade of phil and me working together
1647328 i inked him on a test piece to see if we gelled he liked it and weve been working together ever since
1647329 andys inks were as flawless then as they are now
1647330 for me the spider man learning curve has been steeper than i thought
1647331 it sounds strange but i take the job so seriously that i think sometimes i over think i think the fact that this new arc has a new villain i helped create and therefore have a strong investment in establishing has kept me really engaged i feel like im building on real spider man history and thats an honor for anyone in our business
1647332 some inkers are intimidated by phils incredibly detailed approach but i tend to lose myself in the pages phil and i have reached a level of confidence where he can loosen up on the pencils and i can fill in based on years of experience inking his work it has enabled us to get out of some deadline crunches where phil has produced breakdowns that i have finished and hopefully the readers havent noticed a drop in quality
1647333 phil is getting to draw his own backyard and you can see the love he has for the architecture and life of new york coming through on every page this is one comic book where the background city is one of the main characters
1647334 chris is not only a superb colorist but a great illustrator in his own right
1647335 i havent colored a lot of spider man in the past so re familiarizing myself with the character and his supporting cast has taken a bit of doing
1647336 getting those eye colors right is a little frustrating but spidey was one of my favorite characters when i was a kid so its always a blast to get to color one of his books tweaking the look of the new kraven has been fun too
1647337 i think weve done some nice work on this arc and it has a lot to with taking spider man fans really seriously
1647338 i want to do their favorite character justice in the way i love seeing my favorites portrayed well artistically
1647339 being a kid in the business world good or bad
1647340 unbelievable we immediately sent your complaint to them but as you probably know not surprisingly the whole of italy is now on holiday until the end of august very annoying i can appreciate
1647341 longevity sex symbols have notoriously short shelf lives and the few that endure loom large in our pop culture consciousness liz marilyn madonna in an age of fleeting sexperts and flavor of the month porno queens its nothing short of remarkable that after 30 years xaviera hollander is still a household name
1647342 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets
1647343 he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them into office
1647344 desegregation racial harmony fair wages womens rights and gay rights
1647345 just throw money at them for their research cause they are very special people
1647346 to study how science is organized and if scientists are working in the most productive way
1647347 learn from the different models for stem cell research that are going on around the world
1647348 time and time again around the world too many scientists have bent the rules for their own personal gain research simply must not be funded without the highest degree of public scrutiny not allow itself to be blinded by the glitter of a world class researcher
1647349 the general consensus among researchers is that embryonic stem cells hold the greatest promise to derive treatments that can alleviate the suffering from spinal cord injury and a host of other debilitating and deadly medical conditions
1647350 if new jersey wants to become a leader in stem cell research it must also be a leader in promoting embryonic stem cell research
1647351 kateri moore bone marrow stem cell researcher and associate professor at mt
1647352 we were concerned with the direction that the new jersey effort was headed and the lack of prominent stem cell biologists in new jersey
1647353 the three projects are being launched as voters prepare to consider a 450 million bond issue on nov 6 that would bankroll grants for research into stem cell based medical treatments embryonic stem cells the building blocks of living things are seen as a potential key to curing diseases like alzheimers lou gehrigs disease and spinal cord injuries but their use in research is opposed by critics who say it involves killing human embryos and could lead to human cloning
1647354 i think michaels a fantastic swimmer and i think if anyone in the world could possibly do it itd be michael

1647358 he may be the first drug addict who becomes a super villain and that informs everything he does
1647359 the basic concept for freak is my own with embellishments by the brain trust and editors
1647360 i described certain key visual elements in the script but left other aspects up to artist phil jimenez he got it right the first time so we didnt have to do any artistic tweaking
1647361 but its almost always a function of a good writer teamed with a good artist a villain can be pretty uninspired at first go round but a good hook can make a huge difference
1647362 somebody on the creative side has to be inspired either with the visuals or the m o or the characters agenda
1647363 that will make him very interesting to brink back in the future inside reference absolutely intended he doesnt have a very deep agenda but hes also someone i could see being used and manipulated by a smarter villain
1647364 because hes selfish anti social angry and less than an intellectual giant freak does not play well with others
1647365 no one is going to want to go out and grab a beer with this guy
1647366 that team i wasnt familiar with any of them until today
1647367 but theyve got some players over there that are some pretty damn good players
1647368 during the energy fight she cut off the energy to the house floor so members couldnt talk about energy
1647369 quote confirmed his complete desire to finish with rugby league and switch over to union
1647370 weve got the wildcard it could be right up until he gets in here obviously give him every chance to respond
1647371 all the players without fail have said how much they enjoy coming up here and the atmosphere up here has been great and people just cant do enough for them
1647372 id have dinner with the guy and wed talk about sports or hed ask me about my life was i dating anyone
1647373 he was a priest but he was a normal guy
1647374 ive seen a couple that had actually gotten in trouble and i thought ok i can see that not so with father killion
1647375 you cant expect to build a pyramid and see everything change overnight it happens gradually
1647376 the possibility of any emergency decreases including hurricanes and typhoons it seriously changes physical and psychological conditions
1647377 they say no pills can help you like the pyramid
1647378 my husband drank a lot and we had no money now i live alone and life is better i feel healthier
1647379 a brief description of the effect of the pyramid shape on things
1647380 a brief description of the effect of the pyramid shape on the organism
1647381 its difficult for me to really seriously judge but i do believe it has some cosmic force
1647382 they say the pyramid charges everything here with special energy i was always curious about it
1647383 the way mr brown was murdered it was clear that omar cashs intentions were to kill him without question
1647384 she hulk v1 4 was the first time i got to write spider man in a full length mainstream marvel comic
1647385 it features the incredibly inventive art of juan bobillo and a premise youve always wanted to see spider man sues the daily bugle

1647392 there obviously is some flexibility for elected officials and their staffs
1647393 out of kilter with those salaries paid in the merit system
1647394 thats like taking a wet mop and slapping everyone in the face with it
1647395 i didnt ask for a car ive already got a car that i worked and paid for myself
1647396 i didnt ask for anything to begin with but on the same token i shouldnt be spending my own money when the city by law is obligated to buy the mayor a car
1647397 i resent how we focus on the mundane and the stupid when in fact its not something i asked for to begin with
1647398 before this becomes an issue ill just keep my car and ask the legislature to change it the law and give a 750 a month car allowance and pay for the gas
1647399 nobody can buy more cars than i buy the only difference between men and boys are the size of their toys and you all sell the toys that i like
1647400 we pay 120 for a pair of sneakers for a 12 year old child are you crazy

1647418 is what i am about to say worth that little bit of trouble
1647419 dogs possess the capacity for a rudimentary form of empathy
1647420 other studies also demonstrated that dogs follow human pointing more likely to tell humans the location of hidden objects when they didnt see the object being hidden and tend to steal food when the humans are looking away or closing their eyes
1647421 as the dogs amazing skills to read human communication cues are thought to have been selected by human over last 15 000 years it is also possible that the same evolutionary process affected their skills to empathise with humans
1647422 another possibility is that contagious yawning and possibly empathy could be a more widespread characteristics among mammals
1647423 it is possible that such contagion coordinate the mood status between the dogs and humans
1647424 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region

1647458 they are committed to helping north korea integrate into the international community and thereby partake in the peace and prosperity on the korean peninsula and in northeast asia

1647488 as our understanding of elderhood and its rightful place in our society grows
1647489 the creation and sharing of legacy will come to be seen as an essential part of late life our society needs these legacies and day by day grows less and less able to gain access to them
1647490 embracing elderhood and its use of the lifebio system builds a bridge between the long term care community and the larger local area
1647491 our dream is to inspire program participants our elder storytellers included to see elderhood in a new light and transform the general publics perspective about aging one relationship at a time
1647492 this program has completely changed the way i think about elderhood
1647493 it helped me to understand that elders dont just live in the past they still have the desire to learn great senses of humor and important lives to live
1647494 we must know people deeply in order to love and appreciate them embracing elderhoods mission and lifebios tools are a perfect combination for long term care settings or any community hoping to celebrate the lives of the individuals who reside there
1647495 whats unique about this program is how legacy creation is explored through the filter of the eden alternatives ten principles the two work together as though they were made for each other it is a marriage made in heaven
1647496 i am thrilled about lifebios service my mom has been saying for quite some time that she wants to write down some stories of her life she hasnt done it and i think that it is in large part due to the fact that it is a big task how do you start this is perfect i am very excited to give her a memory journal for christmas and then enter her answers at lifebio com too i have already told a couple of people about your service

1647507 todays seniors have lived through some of the most amazing times in our nations history but very few have actually had affordable easy to use tools at their fingertips to record it not only do residents in lifebio communities have the opportunity to help capture the big picture of what was going on in the world during their lives they also can capture their personal perspective to share with their families
1647508 we expect our number of certified communities to triple in the next 12 months
1647509 this program allows caregivers and residents to get to know each other it helps residents reminisce about their lives and it provides a lasting keepsake for family members

1647511 lifebio provides senior adults life changing opportunities to tell their stories in a powerful and meaningful way lifebio honors and enriches future generations by capturing legacies that frequently disappear from personal family histories because oral storytelling is fading from generation to generation
1647512 this program has generated excitement among the residents and in all levels of our community it has helped develop relationships between residents staff and volunteers
1647513 the process of remembering details from your life story is not only rewarding it has real cognitive fitness benefits too as we exercise the hippocampus region of the brain where memories are stored
1647514 lifebio questions made it much easier to stimulate my mind and record my life history its something i wanted to do for my children for a long time and lifebio made it possible

1647576 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1647577 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory

1647601 its difficult to underestimate the significance of smoke filled rooms in making political decisions
1647602 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1647603 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1647604 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1647605 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1647606 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions

1647617 you agree not to install use or run the apple software on any non apple labeled computer or to enable others to do so
1647618 but take a look at the web site of the lead attorney representing apple
1647619 they came to us i think because this is a much bigger issue than just copyright
1647620 theres the fact that we are in the jurisdiction of the u s district court for northern california but weve also tangled with apple before weve dealt with apple so were familiar with the courts and the parties
1647621 what psystar might say is what we would like to do is use the mac operating systems unique features more broadly on a variety of hardware

1647623 my guess is that they will mount some kind of direct attack on apples exclusive licensing

1647630 civic precinct newcastle has worked hard to build audiences and to present a diverse and high quality annual season of performing arts which have had an enormous impact on the cultural fabric of our region the diminishing funding for national touring of performing arts is a backward step and will have profound repercussions on future programming
1647631 we call on the government to provide playing australia with the required 2million increase and to put into place a strategy for periodic increases so we can continue to challenge our audiences and provide a performing arts program of which we can be proud lets not allow our audiences to be penalised for living in a regional part of australia
1647632 the australian governments playing australia program is a victim of its own success and no longer has the funds to sustain the increasing demand in applications playing australia provides access to some of the countrys best performing arts including dance music and theatre by providing funding assistance to companies and producers to cover the costs which would other wise make the presentation unviable those costs are freight travel accommodation and allowances

1647658 quark customers desire the latest technology when interacting with us the virtual knowledge base provides another valuable option to our existing support of live telephone chat and email support
1647659 the point of including a background section for each solution is to offer customers more than a static and simplistic listing of software issues
1647660 we wanted to create a dynamic tool that contains information that can help customers build their own technical understanding of particular software issues or behaviours that way if a similar production issue comes up in the future they will know right away how to handle it

1647682 we are cognizant that the economy is impacting our customers and may potentially impact our business that being said though we continue to remain confident in our business
1647683 we continue to execute on our land and expand strategy while delivering true measurable roi to our customers
1647684 we remain focused on our core value proposition which is to help our clients deliver superior customer experiences while reducing their operating cost
1647685 anyway you look at it our second quarter of 2008 was another stellar quarter for netsuite
1647686 when compared with recent trends seen in the market in which we play specifically the mid market erp business application space the performance was fantastic in this past quarter we saw traditional mid market application vendor sale stall and shrink
1647687 when compared with recent trends seen in the market in which we play specifically the mid market erp business application space the performance was fantastic
1647688 our customers know that we deliver real value whether it is by increasing self service rates reducing email and call volumes or making their contact centre agents more efficient
1647689 for example epson recently deployed our solution for 400 agents in four contact centre around the world with the help of rightnow agents now resolve 80 of incoming inquiries on the first call with our web self service solution epson saw a 26 reduction in email volume within just four months
1647690 we all know it costs less to retain current customers than acquire new ones
1647691 land and expand is really at the heart of the way we go to market it plays very well in the current economic environment because the land and expand strategy does not require a customer to make a huge investment upfront through early success and quick roi we earn the right to come back and do the follow on business
1647692 i never get tired of talking about the roi we create for our clients so i am pleased to report that the colorado department of revenue a rightnow customer for eight years just recently won the nucleus roi award some 90 of their site visitors are now able to find answers quickly online this equates to call centre volume reductions of about 45 and a savings of more than 5 million life to date
1647693 intuitive surgical a fast growing publicly traded 600 million company and the leader in operative surgical robotics selected netsuite crm to integrate and manage a number of complex business processes that they provide to hospitals nationwide
1647694 what has changed in the last year is people look at rightnow as a viable replacement for their siebel deployment that has a lot of hair on it
1647695 wasserman media a leading sports marketing agency replaced microsoft great plains with netsuite to manage complex business processes unique to their industry such as partner athlete commissions athlete management and media purchases and finally nestle uk the british arm of the worlds foremost nutrition health and wellness company used netsuite ecommerce to build a completely integrated web store in six weeks under rigid requirements
1647696 as you look at the leading indicators of our business leads and pipeline we havent seen an economic impact and in fact to date those two leading indicators have grown faster than historically
1647697 its basically business as usual for netsuite we dont have a ton of exposure in financial services and construction and those markets
1647698 almost every vendor out there says they are counter cyclical but as weve gone through this economic cycle i really do believe that it is true in netsuites case i think we are in a great position when economies are booming and nobody wants to have economic slowdown but certainly the economics of sap and more importantly the economics of netsuite the economics of a multi application solution that is integrated are really compelling on the downside as well
1647699 we are cognizant that the economy is impacting our customers and may potentially impact our business
1647700 that being said though we continue to remain confident in our business for the second half of this year
1647701 at a macro level we have not seen any real changes in the competitive landscape
1647702 we are in a great position when economies are booming and nobody wants to have economic slowdown but certainly the economics of sap and more importantly the economics of netsuite the economics of a multi application solution that is integrated are really compelling on the downside as well
1647703 what has changed in the last year is people look at rightnow as a viable replacement for their siebel deployment that has a lot of hair on it
1647704 the high ground in the account as far as we are concerned is the agent desktop that is the ground we have to occupy our calling card is the e service stuff because it is complementary to existing crm deployments they have in place we come in that way we prove our value we earn the right to take away the agent desktop business that is really the big difference from a year ago that is why the expansion opportunity is bigger

1647753 without the congestion charge the traffic problems in london would be much worse
1647754 however as a result of other interventions such as utility and construction works the reduction in road space has had a detrimental impact on congestion levels and is slowing traffic down
1647755 i have always thought that the congestion charge is a blunt instrument
1647756 it has proved successful in cutting traffic coming into london but on its own has not resolved the problem of congestion
1647757 i have scrapped the co2 charge that risked thousands of small cars flooding central london and have asked tfl to bring forward a range of measures to turn around the trend and halt the squeezing of road space that has continued to worsen congestion

1647899 wellis a perfect example of the kind of play i want mct to produce it engages enlightens and challenges and i think lisa kron is a major new american voice that needs to be heard
1647900 her dialogue is incredibly funny and accessible but she also introduces a lot of important provocative topics i think milwaukeeans in particular can benefit from hearing her take on healthy communities and integration
1647901 unlike most playwrights lisa kron does not worry about structure shes truly a free thinker theres a beautiful and rather profound messiness to her writing
1647902 this would be a difficult thing for milwaukee businesses to absorb and would ultimately drive some smaller businesses out of the city we need to remove some of the barriers and reduce the red tape that businessmen face right now
1647903 her experience and tenacity serve our constituents well on issues that matter to them like controlling government spending creating jobs and cracking down on criminals i am asking the voters to keep the ott darling team together so we can continue to work on behalf of the hard working families of our districts
1647904 ljudje iz okolice bodo tu pustili avto dobili dva etona oziroma mestno kartico nazaj grede pa bodo potencialni kupci trgovskega centra
1647905 i believe god is deeply saddened by this just as we are but for years weve been telling god to get out of our schools to get out of our government and to get out of our lives and being the gentleman he is i believe he has calmly backed out how can we expect god to give us his blessing and his protection if we demand he leave us alone
1647906 damn i wish id written that right on you go girl
1647907 the first thing were gonna do is get the brakes on our fire truck fixed
1647908 mentoring is a relational experience in which one person empowers another by sharing god given resources
1647909 i will make you make mistakes small mistakes that you will learn from and i will not let you hurt any patients

1647913 most of our collective history is going to represent a proud past
1647914 through the 1970s 80s and 90s we have been on a journey of deploying great systems of record
1647915 it began in the 70s with the mainframe and its bespoke systems
1647916 there is a move away from systems of record towards productivity applications of course this is what we were supposed to have been doing for the past 30 years but we were lying it was marketing
1647917 on january 1 we woke up and said were full and we slowed down the spending so that we could absorb it all
1647918 the move is away from systems of record towards productivity applications of course this is what we were supposed to have been doing for the past 30 years but we were lying it was marketing we did make the systems of record more productive but they dont make you or your customer more productive no one sat down in front of an oracle or an sap application and said wow ive never been so productive you were still a slave to a system of record that puts you through hoop after hoop
1647919 firstly we move from a computer centric paradigm to a communication centric paradigm
1647920 now we start at the moment of user interaction and work back we start with the moment of truth when the customer is making a purchase or someone is checking for a lost bag at an airline you work back from that moment of truth and work out how to inform that moment
1647921 secondly we realise that this is not about transactional processing were now in a world where the analytical information is more important than the transactional information we all carry mobile devices that put us in the communications moment of truth were not only transacting were interacting its less about reporting much more about search the google isation of our personal lives is showing how powerful this is but the enterprise is the last bastion of not being google ised thirdly is the move from wired to unwired
1647922 its not just about having data any more its about having the right instance of that data at the right time
1647923 the new audiences are the ones that are the most user empowered the enterprise is becoming unwired our job is to prevent it from becoming unraveled
1647924 weve had to go through a significant architectural investment our system of record has gone through a significant shift users used to go to it and say they needed a certain report and it would need this numbers and it would be needed by yesterday weve tried to create an environment where the system of record is aided by the outside looking in the user in customer service can take a report surf up and down and create a report that is applicable and decision ready information that is available when they want it its real time analytics
1647925 we see analytics becoming more and more critical to users
1647926 what they need complements the it investment especially analytics in real time
1647927 for the past three years weve worked with 150 of our customers to redesign our crm we learned from some very tough conversations users have a lot more power today in lots of these meetings we see users deciding which applications and which productivity applications they will use they have to be more analytical they have to be more communications centric it can be frustrating users can be fickle you talk to one group of users who say we dont want that consistent user interface we want this one they say why do i have to browse why not text then you go to another group in the same company and they want to browse
1647928 we are taking on a new audience whether we like it or not the new audiences are the ones that are the most user empowered the enterprise is becoming unwired our job is to prevent it from becoming unraveled we cant retreat to the system of record that wont work anymore
1647929 a year ago everybody was expecting high single digit growth in the database market what we have experienced in the second half of last year was growth that was in the mid to high teens and the first half of this year has seen the same and maybe some upturn we have just finished a quarter with 38 database growth i challenge the industry analysts as to why this does not give us a better market share why arent we gaining market share
1647930 i get a sense of being like rodney dangerfield and not getting the level of recognition that is due to us we have a very strong story right now and the investor community is taking a big interest in that
1647931 ive been at sybase for eleven years and we have been getting better coverage from the industry analyst over the past five years as we have been delivering the growth thats all very positive stuff
1647932 but i still believe that if we had been better presented by someone like my friend salesforce com ceo marc benioff or oracle ceo larry ellison if he had finished racing his yacht then the market share would have gone through the roof
1647933 so i get a sense of being like rodney dangerfield and not getting the level of recognition that is due to us we have a very strong story right now and the investor community is taking a big interest in that to gain more customers the analysts opinions do matter ive run into various customers who want to know what the analyst have said mostly about the bad or the indifferent
1647934 we want to have the ability to generate lots of leads and to ensure the quality of those leads
1647935 we have not invested much in product advertising we have done a lot of branding and web seminars and activities all aimed at creating activity in the pipelines the sales people tend to feel that they have been helped to be successful in their jobs
1647936 we are answering a simple question how to bridge between old and new technologies
1647937 there is a 60 increase in the volume of data every year the data volume is doubling that volume is interesting we as an industry have to learn how to deal with volume the velocity of data is very different now people need to get at data now not in ten minutes from now but now they want data that is relevant as well as rapid
1647938 if you look at who is accessing the data its no longer just the employees the demands of the non employee for accessing from outside the firewall is much different todays architectures will not meet this demand
1647939 were making a run at the major data warehouse providers and we think we can compete very well
1647940 the demands of information are changing and you need a different set of architecture paradigms to make this happen
1647941 there is an increasing demand for analytics and our data architectures cannot meet the demands of the new systems that are coming our customers are making progress towards the unwired enterprise that is based on information delivery for decision making at any time any place
1647942 when we start to design for an application we look at it and say whos going to access the data and how are they going to access the data
1647943 information delivery is even more important its time to evolve this and not go through a full set of replacements its not just transactional applications its analytics mobile and messaging applications these applications come from outside the firewall and through a mobile device in a unstructured ad hoc form if you look at who is accessing the data its no longer just the employees the demands of the non employee for accessing from outside the firewall is much different todays architectures will not meet this demand
1647944 we believe that execution by way of a gunfire is inhumane it is for these reasons that the defense attorneys are applying to challenge the legislation
1647945 its not a matter for us whether or not amrozi is to be executed gunfire is one way another way of doing it is by lethal injection
1647946 we believe that is still more humane than by a gunfire
1647947 the security agents of the basep presidential security battalion came to our home around 9 20 5 20 a m edt and took away my father
1647948 if i died suddenly i doubt id get one hundredth this kind of response
1647949 you have to be a primary care doc to earn this much affection
1647950 what do you think about whats your experience of blah blah blah focal twins
1647951 maybe all these years and all these relationships i have filled my life with have been lies all lies and it wasnt the fault of the liar it was the downfall of all the daydreaming i fell too hard he left too fast the rain came much too quickly because i allowed myself to float away on the clouds to such a degree that i was never able to see beyond the glare of the stars in my own eyes
1647952 yet in our dreamy eyes misted of red hearts and shining stars we feel celestial we are alive it is love that ticks our clocks the mutual connection understanding the heartfelt encumbering of two reaching out to become one and love it is so malignant they way it spreads to every blood vessel it pierces every vein fills up every empty space behind the walls of our eyes and hearts so much so that we begin to feel no one has ever felt this way before or maybe just maybe could it be possible they havent
1647953 nazi like jewish settlers have of late stepped up their indiscriminate attacks on palestinian civilians and their property throughout the west bank
1647954 to be one of the fresher and more original in his line of productions
1647955 my all time favorite stoner film but goes further to deliver tons and tons of huge laughs and adding alot of pop to an already great screenplay by seth rogen and even goldberg writers and real live inspiration for
1647956 which is to say they were funny but far from memorable
1647957 just with less meaning to it and instead is replaced by a certain satirical aire to it when doing action sequences and for its love of keeping the camera on these two guys throughout their weed induced segements of pure paranoia
1647958 works on the level that it give more than blue screen hjinks or witty conversations around the circle
1647959 which while it was funny it was also sooooo out there and loose that it could be a bit too much at times this one stays grounded better flows nicer and still manages to feel more original then most comedies
1647960 she likes to giggles i pause oh my god im sorry i laugh a little out of embarrassment but ummm on the weekends likes to hang out with her oh my god i said it again name likes to hang out
1647961 i have nothing to prove i have nothing to lose i have nothing to hide
1647962 to reach beyond soundbites and sensational predictions about the future of the automobile and our environment to deliver information that you can rely on to make decisions in your everyday life
1647963 the 10 cars that will change your mind about diesel
1647964 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking
1647965 theres a stalinist in each of you theres even a stalinist in me we must root out this evil
1647966 your legs are gone youre too old youre too slow
1647967 auch wenn die langfristige f rderung der regenerativen energiequellen sicherlich ein erfolgversprechender weg ist kurzfristig wird diese form der energiegewinnung die versorgungsl cken in europa und andernorts nicht schlie en k nnen
1647968 uns ist es gelungen eine so genannte hochtemperatur membran technik zu entwickeln mit deren hilfe der reine sauerstoff 02 bei vergleichsweise niedrigeren temperaturen von etwa 850 grad celsius gewonnen werden kann
1647969 it hockey is a family sport i think thats the reason why you have a lot of brothers as all the family members play
1647970 so there is always the possibility of brothers playing together in the national team
1647971 we know each other so well that we communicate by eye contact on the field
1647972 benjamin shows me the right side with his eyes i know where he will run and get the pass from me
1647973 in the absence of a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for in our extended package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive
1647974 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next steps before i get in front of them
1647975 we dont have the decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1647976 it was first time i observed a bangladesh election and i was impressed by watching so many people keen to vote
1647977 we commend the election commission for its professional administration of these elections which were an important step for the parliamentary polls and restoration of a democratically elected government in bangladesh
1647978 the doctors thought i was going to die in two days
1647979 then they thought id never be able to fly again on a plane just to be here i feel like i won a big match already
1647980 it wasnt something i was doing for performance enhancement it was something i needed to do to stay alive
1647981 in athens i thought losing two medals was the worst thing that couldve happened to my life
1647982 i would much rather trade all my athletic accomplishments to spend one hour with either of my parents again
1647983 but he came through it an decided to try one more time
1647984 four years ago i felt like i had to win a medal or nothing would matter
1647985 now im able to just relax and enjoy the olympic experience im more composed i dont feel so high strung the biggest problem that i have is remaining even keeled sometimes i want to win so badly that i just cant contain myself
1647986 he was here for a peaceful purpose theres no rational basis for his detention
1647987 they didnt expect to be blocked at the airport there was no explanation at all other than this is a special time for the olympics
1647988 now that the olympic games are finally upon us its a chance to show how tibetans feel and what their hopes are
1647989 outsiders may think that the tibetans are treated very well and that they are happy but the truth is that tibetans are not free to speak of their suffering
1647990 even if i had to sacrifice my life for this message to be seen by the dalai lama i agree and welcome this chance
1647991 it is very difficult for tibetans to go to beijing and speak out there so that is why we decided to show the real feelings of tibetans inside tibet through this film
1647992 liu xiang must wake up every morning and see a picture of robles in his head
1647993 one has a really huge amount of pressure on him and the other one has so much to gain
1647994 the majority of chinese probably wont understand who robles is and what he has done and they just expect liu to turn up and win but this guy can deliver the goods as well
1647995 in the last three or four years there are at least 10 15 countries where we had problems
1647996 in most cases the government agrees admits its errors and changes its policies sometimes the government does not want to admit that it has broken the rules of the olympic charter and then we apply suspensions
1647997 i always felt we have to discuss respectfully with the governments
1647998 but whenever you enter a discussion you need a face saving situation a win win situation a situation that saves their face
1647999 i hope we meet in the gold medal game then well see
1648000 being the favorite team doesnt necessarily mean you win gold
1648001 there are several big teams in the competition such as argentina or greece and especially the united states is very strong this year
1648002 even though we came here to win the gold medal we have to start from the very beginning we will have time to speak about the united states when we face them in the first round
1648003 once we are in the quarter finals we will begin to make plans we must demonstrate to everyone why we came here as the favorites
1648004 we have to think about our first match for now lets just forget what kobes been saying for now
1648005 he has been rescued and he is probably about to reach skardu on the helicopter hell receive some medical treatment once he gets there
1648006 and because 150 200 people cause trouble at tarija airport what are we losing bolivia is losing out on signing energy contracts
1648007 this suspension of the summit was decided due to these acts of violence provocation and intolerance promoted by bands of fascist conservative retrograde groups
1648008 are crazy and we dont want that kind of government in our country
1648009 this is a massacre and the only one to blame is evo morales
1648010 this has been the iranian strategy for years to bide their time and continue with their enrichment
1648011 thats to be determined the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist
1648012 the north korean leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program
1648013 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list then the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1648014 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists
1648015 thats my hope for the sake of peace its my hope for the sake of our children
1648016 the relay of the sacred flame of the olympic games displays our national spirit
1648017 i dont think chairman mao would ever have imagined this
1648018 whatever the international community does china can do it also
1648019 after lighting it my mind when blank and then i just wanted to hurry up running ahead
1648020 but i really do wish i had got to see it myself that would have been a real exciting feeling
1648021 the olympics are fine but we also want our legal rights too
1648022 as the chinese leadership prepares its display of grandeur and power in beijing it is waging a ruthless campaign of repression inside tibet
1648023 people will use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1648024 to those who are forced to go through forced abortions and have no voice we are your voice
1648025 we dont have the same rights as in america and other countries
1648026 it wasnt possible for tibetans to participate like they wanted so this was the minimum we could do to show our presence
1648027 to facilitate the reconstitution of the board the present members have tendered their resignations to governor n n vohra
1648028 we have just briefed the leaders of the political parties who are supporting the government we are briefing them the factual positions all of them will attend the meeting of the all party meeting conveyed by the prime minister and the former meeting will be after the all party meeting conveyed by the pm thereafter well be able to give more information
1648029 the material given by the home ministry is insufficient so the ban cannot be continued
1648030 remember what i enter in forms and the search bar
1648031 tell me if the site im visiting is a suspected attack site
1648032 tell me if the site im visiting is a suspected forgery
1648033 warn me when web sites try to redirect or reload the page
1648034 when updates to iceweasel are found ask me what i want to do
1648035 i think what we shot for the cover was really very interesting especially where we used sheets and all and its just that there is a great sensuality to it i always think that minimal make up and no fuss hair takes away from everything and its all about the eyes
1648036 she has been in the industry for a while now she is very confident about her own self lot has been said about her dressing and all that but she is very aware about herself now and its a new vidya and its great to be a part of that new state she is in
1648037 dna specific but generally applicable amber with gromacs 3 3 x installation and notes
1648038 i dont know how it has happened so far the tests that took place hasnt shown any indications politics has been played with me so far four tests have taken place the results of these four tests havent come out yet a player will never commit such mistakes
1648039 which is the test that the officials are quoting four tests were conducted and the results of the last two tests are not yet out
1648040 i requested officials to send me to beijing and get the doping test done there shoot me if the result of beijing test is positive the procedures followed by the lab is irregular not only in my case but in other peoples case as well
1648041 there are all chances that samples could have been changed or samples could have been polluted as well we had informed the government in writing about the inability of the lab to conduct proper test
1648042 if she would have been allowed to come here it would have been a matter of shame for the entire contingent so it is good that she was not allowed to come here
1648043 my sort of suggestion was we should focus on 2020 olympic games obviously its a nice fit with the term twenty20 but i think its going to take a bit of time and serious thought rather than just rush into it so lets just throw it out there see what support there is around the world
1648044 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1648045 it will help the players to be part of a worldwide movement cricket is an exciting sport and should definitely be part of the olympics
1648046 not a bad idea i suppose its an international sport maybe it takes too long maybe the 20 over format would be a good one
1648047 weve got to investigate getting into new areas as a sport and i think becoming part of the olympic movement is going to enhance that and twenty20 is a perfect vehicle to getting there and bring that forward
1648048 reports that the examination done a few hours before saiful lodged a police report against anwar showed no evidence that saiful had been sodomised by anyone has raised serious quesions
1648049 the answers are important as they bring into focus the integrity of the malaysian law enforcement
1648050 also of concern is the abrupt disappearance of private investigator p balasubramaniam in the altantuya shaariibuu murder case after his first and second statutory declarations
1648051 the disappearance has yet to be satisfactorily explained by the authorities all these show a pattern of events that caused much disquiet to the right thinking public its disturbing that the questions are unanswered
1648052 the credibility of malaysias judicial system is at stake as the public must be left without doubt that the criminal justice system is not misused or abused
1648053 rory has worked with steve walsh and the conditioning team on his rehab
1648054 he also had a minor knee operation to clean up the joint and he is really looking forward to the new season
1648055 its a dream im living it and rapt at the moment but obviously sitting on the bench is not something that im used to
1648056 the way rugby is my chances are going to come so ive just got to work hard when im in there and try and improve my game
1648057 i feel my game is improving massively just training every day in that environment
1648058 its the best of the best sort of thing so when youre training there you can feel yourself improving all the time and i know a lot of my skills my kicking skills have improved massively since ive been in there
1648059 weve got until thursday off i came in this morning and did some of my own fitness work and then id just be sitting around home probably and i love getting back to the waikato team so i just got out there with the boys and had a bit of fun with them
1648060 i was also trying to help the boys get up
1648061 theyve obviously had a tough start to the air new zealand cup and i just tried to get in there and gee them up a little boost their confidence a bit
1648062 its a fickle world and i guess now i know what its all about
1648063 if an agent who was accredited by us encouraged and promoted a player to breach his contract and go overseas in similar circumstances to sonny bill wed probably go close to disbarring him and revoking his licence
1648064 it would be in breach of our code of conduct which requires all players to adhere to their side of the contract
1648065 we also had a university of nsw contract law expert deborah healey in who said facilitating a player breaching their contract that they too could be liable
1648066 the selections on the night gave us the right options to be able to attack the new zealanders where we wanted to
1648067 unfortunately we werent accurate in the line out play and that compromised us
1648068 its one of those things you can pick a taller line out but irrespective of who you pick you have to be accurate in your skill
1648069 i thought the first two matches we met those physical challenges last week against new zealand we probably didnt
1648070 theres no denying it was a performance that wasnt good but i think the signs generally have been there
1648071 theres a lot of excitement about whats happening at the moment and they will be busting to get back into it to put that performance behind them
1648072 it was a little out of character and we will be doing our best to rectify that
1648073 that is a team you would look at and say immediately it would be an honour for anyone to lead
1648074 england rugby has always been regardless whether it is the era as world cup winners finishing second or being knocked out in the quarter finals as we were in 1999 a team full of promise incredible work rate belief effort collective respect and trust
1648075 i have captained the side not as many times as others but i have always really enjoyed the job because you just have this feeling when you look at the guys around you and you think it is a pleasure to be here
1648076 you have a huge faith that these guys are doing everything they can for you so it is east to reciprocate that
1648077 no trivia sections especially ones which have blobs of text defending war criminals
1648078 two face is likely to be receiving lots of attention when the dark knight film is released is anyone interested in working this up to ga good article level before may
1648079 following the release of the dark knight does anyone else think ballistics or bomb expert should be added to jokers repertoire of abilities
1648080 because the only source has been the national enquirer we have decided not to cover the rumours or salacious speculations
1648081 forced to react not with diplomatic but with military technical methods
1648082 if russians stopped drinking czech beer in response to the stationing of the us radar base it would be a much more serious sign more serious than cutting off oil supplies or than any letter of protest sent by the russian foreign minister
1648083 the prime minister is pleased to direct that the federal government will carry out further deliberation on coordinating the intelligence efforts
1648084 we were only a year apart and we would always play basketball together
1648085 his death has deeply saddened the whole team and left its mark its such a great pity were all very upset
1648086 but mentally we are ready for it we have nothing to lose and we dont have any pressure
1648087 most of us are about 22 or 23 years old the oldest player is only 25 but weve been playing together for four months and the spirit is good
1648088 we didnt come here to lose we are already focused on this game and we will be aggressive with them
1648089 the consumer spending in india has increased by an impressive 75 percent in the last four years and will quadruple in the next 20 years
1648090 domestic retailers and mall developers will be moving into the smaller towns and cities with alacrity in order to respond to the growing consumers markets there and to capture the rising demand for branded products
1648091 the concept is still good connecting the dots of the bits and pieces of possible information is a good thing it just shouldnt be in a counterintelligence database
1648092 usually i just sign off on results and make sure they are published in a timely matter but this time i really wanted to get hands on with this casino computer programmer volunteers subject matter so i decided to aide my fellow employees with statistical measurements and data analysis personally im very curious about local casino computer programmer volunteers ideas and trends
1648093 i loved the opportunity to meet and greet the casino computer programmer volunteers survey takers and speak to them one on one i want to get the most accurate and colorful data possible for my work also i want to get personal ideas and view points that will offer some important perspective about the level of casino computer programmer volunteers integration in our society
1648094 i chose not to answer that question because it had nothing to do with the study of casino computer programmer volunteers and everything to do with my personal finances as a result i did not qualify for a compensatory gift but that is fine privacy is important even if were collecting data for academic purposes
1648095 and 50 cash is a nice gift i also added my name to the casino computer programmer volunteers studys contact list for future surveys interviews and any public discussions its a very interesting and important topic
1648096 i was impressed with the publics awareness of casino computer programmer volunteers trends in their daily lives ive been studying them for months now and some surveyees raised questions that i couldnt readily answer in those cases i referred them to write their comments down and submit them to our directors for further review
1648097 weve seen some very interesting commonalities across cultures ethnicities and various different societies casino computer programmer volunteers survey takers were very considerate in their answers and this helped us greatly to further tune our hypotheses in the end well have a great set of data to analyze and study for the future as we continue to review how casino computer programmer volunteers factors work in society
1648098 were really excited with the turn out for this important casino computer programmer volunteers data gathering study with other 1000 participants we will meet all quotas for a statistically significant sample which will guarantee the legitimacy of our casino computer programmer volunteers study data this is absolutely key to professors sunderman baerman and myklebust swimmer who will be collating the results
1648099 we have planned to develop 35 hotels comprising about 6 000 rooms in the next five years across the country the estimated investment construction will be about one billion dollar as we already have the land
1648100 we will also raise about 800 million dollars in the current fiscal from private equity players to develop real estate projects in mumbai
1648101 mumbai will become a bigger market for us in two years than ncr
1648102 to start with we will launch a parcel of 15 hotels this fiscal with about 2 000 rooms the first hotel will be thrown open early next year
1648103 we are looking for a minority dilution of 26 per cent stake to a strategic foreign player in unitech wireless
1648104 borrowing rates have gone up phenomenally in the last fiscal as inflation is going up i do not think there is any respite from the upward borrowing rate
1648105 fernando est un pilote fantastique qui serait un atout pour nimporte quelle quipe dont celle ci

1648108 he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street a bruised reed shall he not break and the smoking flax shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth
1648109 a bruised reed shall he not break and the smoking flax shall he not quench
1648110 political pressure must be ended on the voters and political party members
1648111 as we considered the current parliament illegitimate and renounced our mps mandates it would be incomprehensible and illogical if we make an announcement about our desire to participate in these upcoming elections
1648112 but there is another side we dont want the government the pleasure of standing alone in the elections with its satellite political parties if our colleague political parties agree that we must participate well do so
1648113 it will not be a meeting in the frames of the joint control commission it will be a two sided meeting with a representative from the russian side
1648114 south ossetian side was always for the continuation of the negotiations process but only within the existing four side format of the joint control commission
1648115 this is a very important document which confirms the statements of the georgian side the document proves that the accusations that georgian side opened fire first and shelled peaceful areas in tskhinvali and threatened open war are faked
1648116 these incidents underscore the need for an immediate increase in the number of osce monitors in south ossetia as well as joint georgian russian monitoring of the roki tunnel to stem the flow of illicit arms ammunition and armed groups into the region
1648117 that the tskhinvali regime has obviously stepped up war preparations
1648118 georgia welcomes this decision as an important step in strengthening the role of the international community in resolving the separatist conflict the eus move will help break the discredited monopoly held by the russian federation in providing security on the ground and in facilitating the peace process
1648119 peacekeeping in these regions abkhazia and south ossetia is a suitable undertaking for the european union
1648120 we pulled out of talks in response to the situation in south ossetia our further decisions will depend on the situation there
1648121 we will work with south ossetia on the basis of previously reached agreements we arent going to say out loud what exactly our assistance will be
1648122 mr sherman has infringed my constitutional rights he has shown incompetency and intentional misconduct shown no professionalism his work quality is below an objective standard of reasonableness

1648124 i did not go over or know about till court and was told by sherman i had to agree when i did not so i had to lie under oath
1648125 they have not connected the dots they have added them
1648126 they have fabricated and sugar coated their case and tolerated any type of distasteful behavior when it serves them

1648185 from what ive been told from the hotel the public security bureau showed up at midnight and told them our specific event had to be canceled for safety reasons without going into any specifics
1648186 when i arrived at 8 a m there were public security officials in the press conference room we had booked
1648187 amanda didnt want her voice to be silenced so we went ahead and arranged something else we never knew if we were going to be stopped at any point
1648188 it was a sexy ad really designed for the u s market it was positive and it was supposed to be done in a private function room
1648189 im surprised they were so concerned given weve done similar with asian celebrities in the past
1648190 i have seen a lot of the videos and it brings me to tears
1648191 what some people think is pretty is actually something thats very gruesome and gross
1648192 it is of utmost importance that this case be concluded as soon as possible
1648193 the disappointment i have is knowing theyll never be able to get those boys out
1648194 i see those bodies in that black hole totally covered in coal
1648195 fire us all it wasnt just me it was fire us all and get more players if we couldnt get it in that book the way he wanted it
1648196 my husband is a coal miner my dads a coal miner my brothers a coal miner
1648197 it does carry a risk thats why theyre paid so well but the coal mines actually are pretty safe i think what happened at crandall murray got a little greedy and was robbing coal where he shouldnt have been taking it out
1648198 this takes you through the handbook of what not to do
1648199 we support our employees who we believe took appropriate actions at the time of the incident
1648200 we continue to review our practices and protocols in the wake of this tragedy and will respond further at the appropriate time
1648201 a few of our athletes did wear masks as they came through the airport
1648202 those athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf they now realize and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organizing committee
1648203 i understand that about 200 of our athletes received those masks through the national governing body not directly from the u s olympic committee

1648215 bible prophecies serve a double purpose to impress on our minds the existence of a god who is in control of all events and to warn us of future crises
1648216 many of the bible predictions have already come true to the very date foretold and world history confirms this this compels us to take yet to be fulfilled prophecies seriously
1648217 it is only logical to assume that god would not warn us of the mark of the beast without providing sufficient evidence whereby we can identify what it is and which powers will be responsible for implementing the mark of the beast on the world and more importantly how to avoid receiving it our when our eternal destiny is at stake
1648218 of course it was exciting and fun but anything that even feels exciting and tempting now will just eventually end up in a comfortably good place which is exactly where i feel with c its just not worth it im making that choice
1648219 this is not a blame game all we want is for hsbc to facilitate the delivery of our presents
1648220 we believe this would be easily achieved and could actually be cheaper than organising refunds the deliveries could be organised at cost price and would be a huge publicity coup for them it could save them money as well
1648221 were going to remind hsbc that there is more than just numbers involved and that they have an opportunity to do the right thing and help everybody including themselves
1648222 hsbcs view is that this should never have happened and had the directors acted sooner to address their financial difficulties and appointed administrators when hsbc recommended it may not have happened
1648223 hsbc fully appreciates how wrapits customers feel about this issue and understands their distress and concern that a resolution be found quickly

1648237 reassessed the turnaround strategy with management in the light of the weaker advertising and economic outlook
1648238 while our visibility on advertising revenues beyond september is limited with a strong schedule in place for the rest of the year and planned for 2009 we are confident that we will continue to outperform however we cannot control the economic environment in which we operate as a result of the recent slowdown in the television advertising market the board has taken some tough decisions which are reported here today
1648239 all of our business segments generated year over year gains with record profits reported at our satellite broadcasting cable programming film and television businesses

1648249 the center fielder almost caught it so well take what we can get
1648250 im not going to look a gift horse in the mouth thats one of the most interesting plays i think youll ever see
1648251 while i was running to second i watched the whole thing transpire it was kind of weird because everything is happening that fast all at once you cant really tell whats going on and youre just waiting for it to end to really take a look the ball rolled on the wall for 10 feet and he came in and pulled down the offensive board it was even more amazing to see it on the replay
1648252 i should have caught the ball it hit in the pocket of my glove ross did a great job he jumped up and grabbed it
1648253 the biggest thing is you look around and nobody is counting on you to be that guy
1648254 youre just a complementary piece of that puzzle since ive been here ive had two guys on base every second or third time i get up there thats a testament to the lineup
1648255 just coming over here im trying to be comfortable and trying not to do too much i think thats probably helped simplify it obviously some success early helps you relax a little bit
1648256 anytime you have two pitches you can throw for strikes it makes it tough
1648257 i had a good fastball and a good curveball i cant pinpoint one pitch i got more outs with
1648258 i was just trying to keep it close and get to our good bullpen guys
1648259 what about the guy getting suspended on a night when ive got to face beckett
1648260 his aversion towards women started when he came in contact with a woman called lakshmi anjaiah used to pay her handsomely every week and even neglected his family lakshmi however had illicit relations with other men and this led to anjaiahs aversion towards women
1648261 majority of his victims were either sex workers or labourers who frequented toddy compounds he lured them with money and made them consume liquor and killed them after having sex with them after strangulating the victim anjaiah would smash the victims head with a boulder
1648262 no rape case has been registered against the accused as there was no proof of the victims being raped all the bodies were traced only after a weeks time and it is not possible to medically prove that a women has been raped after a certain period of time
1648263 man is the product of cause which had no prevision of the end they were achieving that his origin his growth his hopes and fears his loves and his beliefs are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms that no fire no heroism no intensity of though and feeling can preserve the individual life beyond the grave that all the labours of the ages all the devotions all the inspiration all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction the vast death of the solar system and that the whole temple of mans achievements must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins

1648275 i didnt know anything andrews was always happy always smiling but i feel sorry for him im with him but i dont know whats going on everybody goes through their own little problems
1648276 from a human being standpoint you always wish for the best for others
1648277 you dont want anyone to ever have any kind of mental breakdown like that
1648278 but there are distractions every year at training camp the big thing is not to pay as much attention to it as the media does i mean if you want to feed your family you better worry about yourself and what you are doing first
1648279 the only thing ill say is that i know that coach reid has spent an awful lot of time with that situation ill talk about the players that are in camp here
1648280 although we clearly face more challenging macro economic conditions in fiscal 2009 the 12 months between 30 june 2008 and 30 june 2009 were well positioned to deliver continued if somewhat less robust growth
1648281 our balance sheet is strong we have solid operating momentum in many of our key businesses and most importantly our assets are diversified both geographically and along business lines enabling us to better respond to the economic challenges we may face this year
1648282 well take one play and run it six or eight ways
1648283 we like the system we feel we can move up and down the field
1648284 if weve got a good running game well run the ball
1648285 but we always give you the perception that we throw the football were a passing team first now if your concept is that youve got to stop the pass weve got michael ferguson in our backfield weve got an advantage now youve got the perception that were going to throw a lot and weve got the best running back in the conference
1648286 i tell the guys that our offense is based on discipline and conditioning
1648287 we use a lot of plays and a lot of people if we spend the time in the meeting room which is needed well learn what we need to do if we get in the best shape well feel good about ourselves that we know we can play four quarters with anybody
1648288 the one thing that helps is knowing whats meant for you and what isnt
1648289 the change has really helped me a lot were getting more times in our meetings especially on special teams i felt last year we were cutting ourselves short in special teams and they suffered
1648290 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games
1648291 the olympic games represent something powerful that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible however the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur
1648292 we are contacting the u s embassy to see what they know about it
1648293 im not surprised they did this because they said they were going to keep out activists
1648294 but these are legitimate olympians with a history with the olympics id sure like to know what the international olympic committee has to say about this i think its really disappointing
1648295 i always liked playing greensboro but the timing wasnt that good
1648296 but im rested and ready to give it a run
1648297 i am not worried about being 45 or even next year for that matter
1648298 i have a great trainer joey diovisalvi whos taken me to the next level and i think hes done wonders for me ive got to give all the kudos to him i think he really took me through a difficult program and its showing up now
1648299 i havent played much since the masters so im pretty fresh
1648300 its a long stretch and a bad time of the year but if i pace myself ill be ok
1648301 if you have a short game you should be pretty good

1648309 it was good to drive it felt nice but it was much too late to fight for the victory
1648310 its obvious that you cannot win the championship if you start every time from the sixth place in the grid

1648320 i dont know where i am going to continue my career the season is starting now and i have offers from other clubs one of them is chelsea but nothing is certain were in talks
1648321 its very bad for me to have to watch brazils olympic team on tv
1648322 my will was to be with the rest of the group but madrid did not want to allow me i am very sad
1648323 it makes me laugh when you see people from big clubs such as sir alex and daniel levy complaining about alleged tapping up and underhand behaviour it brings a right smile to my face
1648324 i know for a fact theres a 14 year old in our academy who has already been tapped up by agents and big clubs im sure its also happening with 11 and 12 year olds so its imperative for the laws to change
1648325 officially we cant talk to players about professional contracts until they are 16
1648326 but in reality most of the deals with other clubs are sealed well before then
1648327 since i came to chelsea we have only spent 8million on deco
1648328 jose bosingwa came before i arrived who else have we bought maybe in the past they have spent more money
1648329 but now they dont need to spend as much because they already have a solid base

1648332 lance armstrong is the guy that i looked to before i even came down with this disease and was diagnosed with this shanteau told a packed media conference for the us swim team
1648333 when you look at what he did after he was diagnosed and treated for it you cant help but be inspired by that
1648334 also to know i will be cured and i will beat this is a pretty inspiring thought too and that its not going to control my life
1648335 a lot of times when you get to an event like this like the olympics games you can put maybe too much pressure on yourself
1648336 i have kind of got an out in cancer in that it kind of keeps things in persepective for me there is a lot more to life than just the olympic games
1648337 i think having learned that lesson really quickly has kind of helped keep this whole event in perspective for me
1648338 what i show the general public is obviously the positive side but i am human and this has been a rollercoaster ride he said
1648339 its on my mind constantly and i cant help that thats just how its going to be
1648340 the support that i have gotten from not only the people that you see sitting up here but the other coaches and staff that is on the olympic team has been tremendous he said
1648341 people ask me how have you been dealing with this how have you remained focus on swimming
1648342 its not very hard when you have one of the best olympic teams in the world in your corner supporting you
1648343 i think the way that he has handled this and the way he has put everything else in perspective for all of us we took a step back and realised there was a little more to all of this than just swimming
1648344 are not blind to the irony of the web as the medium we will use to connect with one another
1648345 we will have to run at the gaps and avoid confrontation
1648346 the new laws elvs will obviously give us a few headaches
1648347 however we have been training with them for some time now with a referee assisting us
1648348 were not going there in the best of conditions and the majority are getting back from vacations
1648349 the preseason games are usually played against a weaker team and we have to go up against the world champion
1648350 the south africans are in full activity and playing in the tri nations
1648351 i hope we win but the only thing im sure about is that when the game finishes im going to be completely out of gas

1648361 was derived from an old english word neger that was itself derived from negro the spanish word for black
1648362 the term n gger is in most contexts a cultural obscenity
1648363 is an opprobrious term employed to impose contempt upon blacks as an inferior race the term itself would be perfectly harmless were it used only to distinguish one class from another but it is not used with that intent it flows from the fountain of purpose to injure
1648364 heard many black students call each other the n word nearly every period of every day
1648365 various reasons as to why it was acceptable for blacks to call each other the word

1648368 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
1648369 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
1648370 those athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf
1648371 they now realize and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organizing committee
1648372 right now theyre trying to figure out why his body rejects transfusions
1648373 i think thats the next step theyre to figure out theyre also trying to figure out if his sister is a bone marrow match so im just kind of taking it day by day
1648374 its nice to be able to talk to him about four days during his treatment i couldnt speak to him he had real bad side effects it feels good to be able to talk to him on the phone and hear his voice and hear him a little peppier than he was a few weeks ago

1648380 it is time to prove that he places the welfare of american communities and those men and women who risk their lives to protect them over the welfare of lying illicit drug smugglers pardon ramos and compean now mr president
1648381 it cannot be overstated that president bushs stolid indifference thus far toward the suffering of these brave protectors of our borders and their families while simultaneously seeking special dispensation for illegal immigrants is unconscionable now it appears that the burden to be borne by agents ramos and compean for unknowingly wounding a now admitted drug criminal as he fled from justice across the border is going to be greater than that to be borne by the criminal himself when the bush administration is seeking to protect polar bears from unproven global warming scare mongering to not pardon or at least commute the sentences of ignacio ramos and jose alonso compean in light of these new found truths will severely tarnish the bush legacy

1648386 if they are able to stick with their college course they are probably more motivated and more self disciplined and are the sort of characters we want to join the army
1648387 a lot of growing up takes place between 16 and 18 we know that a year at college can make a huge amount of difference
1648388 by providing a financial incentive and allowing people to get through their college education we are getting a hugely better educated more mature motivated and informed young person
1648389 a lot of it is because they simply havent thought through what being in the army is about
1648390 we would expect them to join the army as soon as possible after completing their courses
1648391 they have to sign up for the minimum of four years
1648392 a lot of students in fe particularly here in lewisham need all the financial help they can get
1648393 some of them are under pressure from parents to leave college and get a job this is a little financial incentive to support them through

1648398 but i think i really need to have a heart to heart talk with my two project leaders away from the team when we have that kind of friction i dont think the team can be very productive
1648399 i agree you need to have a heart to heart talk with your project leaders
1648400 but what would happen if you had that talk in the meeting instead of away from the team

1648421 the district court mistakenly limited its analysis primarily to the embodiment requirement
1648422 as a result of this error once it determined that the buffer data was clearly capable of being reproduced i e that the work was embodied in the buffer the district court concluded that the work was therefore fixed in the buffer and that a copy had thus been made
1648423 while our inquiry is necessarily fact specific and other factors not present here may alter the duration analysis significantly
1648424 these facts strongly suggest that the works in this case are embodied in the buffer for only a transitory period thus failing the duration requirement
1648425 cablevision we note also has subscribers who use home vcrs or dvrs like tivo and has significant control over the content recorded by these customers but this control is limited to the channels of programming available to a customer and not to the programs themselves cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the video on demand context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing for these reasons we are not inclined to say that cablevision rather than the user does the copying produced by the rs dvr system as a result we find that the district court erred in concluding that cablevision rather than its rs dvr customers makes the copies carried out by the rs dvr system
1648426 cablevision argues that because each rs dvr transmission is made using a single unique copy of a work made by an individual subscriber one that can be decoded exclusively by that subscribers cable box only one subscriber is capable of receiving any given rs dvr transmission

1648434 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1648435 this desert is a hyper arid environment that rarely sees rain and has no vascular plants and is often used by scientists as a matter of fact as a martian analog site
1648436 these compounds are quite stable in soil and water and do not destroy organic materials under normal circumstances in fact there are species of perchlorate producing microbes that live on the energy provided by this oxidant
1648437 unfortunately there was a story out that we were hiding something and of course as soon as that story goes out people speculate the speculation leads to all kinds of wonderful stories of discoveries that i wish wed made but we havent
1648438 we estimate with obviously imperfect information that we are the market leader
1648439 you sure it wasnt the americans coming to secure the oil sands
1648440 we have a new enemy luke skywalker the young rebel who destroyed the death star
1648441 extremely healthy conversations brutally honest conversations everything you wanted to say and wanted to ask went on in our conversations
1648442 we agreed to disagree we stood on opposite sides of the fence on a number of issues the no 1 thing i was looking for out of the conversation was is he really committed to playing football for us his mind set based on some of the things that have happened thats not where he was his feeling was based on where he is he wasnt in the right mind set to play
1648443 he was not in the right mind set to be part of this football team the train has left the station i have to keep the train moving if he wants to jump on the train lets go but if he cant get past the things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1648444 im just trying to stay focused on the things i can control and thats my practice and leading this team
1648445 the team has backed me the whole offseason and i appreciate that back in march after favre announced his retirement they said i was going to be the guy and theyve stuck with that
1648446 its to the point now where were just tired of it here in the locker room
1648447 just hearing about it hopefully theyll get something done upstairs and they can answer these questions instead of you asking us these questions we just get paid to play football
1648448 im just tired of it bretts a friend however it works out i hope hes happy however it works out i hope rodgers happy i hope whatever decision they make they make the best decision to help us get to the super bowl
1648449 very personal i respect the way he feels this has been something thats been extremely stressful for him and for his family hes got a lot going through his head right now i think hes in a tough spot
1648450 its good to be king if just for a while
1648451 the benching certainly meant something throughout the evaluation leading up to the draft that was one reason we had the opportunity to select him in the seventh round but he gets into our training camp now its a clean slate lets go hes got every opportunity to make the most of this
1648452 theres no question he has the measurables size the long arms it appears like he has the skill and ability to really be a good tackle
1648453 now were early hes got a lot of hard work and preparation left to go
1648454 he was telling me to keep working hard he asked me how i thought it was offensive line coach juan castillo told me going in it was going to be a battle its about what i expected
1648455 i guess im doing something good he didnt really get on me about anything
1648456 hes a good athlete hes got a little bit of a sore ankle but hes played through that and hes done very well with it it hurts him a little bit when hes being bull rushed because he cant put his foot in the ground like he wants to hes moving around very well hes got very long arms and knows how to use them hes not afraid to play the game out in front of him ive been impressed with the way hes handled himself
1648457 not really my teammates more just everybody who had doubts about me
1648458 coming in here the coaches believe in me they wouldnt have taken me if they didnt but proving outsiders wrong everybody who didnt think i would be any good thats really my motivation right now
1648459 what that guy didnt understand is that maddy finished sixth in the world in the world whats he ever been sixth in the world at
1648460 i have swimmers who have olympic moments all the time
1648461 obviously id like it to still stay a part of the yankee lore id like it to be somewhere in the stadium i hope they can do that
1648462 i am so grateful and respectful of mr steinbrenner for leaving it empty for 29 years thats the biggest tribute you could ever ask for im sure whatever they do will be fitting
1648463 it should be in the same spot theyve got to find a spot for it
1648464 they had it opened for so long over here and i think they should do the same thing over there leave it the way it is
1648465 they should put it right back in the same spot
1648466 new stadium or old stadium right in the same spot
1648467 i think theres a chance he signs with the phillies
1648468 one of freddys big criteria is playing on a winning team that has a chance to play into october
1648469 we are aware of shawns situation through his representation agent rich moran we are monitoring the situation
1648470 the teams idea was for me to come up there the nfl is a big deal especially in philadelphia
1648471 obviously there was a situation going on if there wasnt hed have been here at camp
1648472 im glad that now hes finding help and that hell be better soon
1648473 we have a lot of good guys who can help
1648474 i think everybody here including coaches would want the best for shawn and understand be very sympathetic to his situation were going to do everything we can to make it the easiest transition and try to get him ready for the season
1648475 you never know whats on the other side of the life
1648476 family money theres a lot of other forces besides football that could affect him
1648477 this is his fifth year he knows the system he knows what he can do hes a pro bowl caliber player hes all pro
1648478 its not like guys are going to be like ah he just doesnt want to play if theres something going on and he just needed to get a handle on it i dont think anybodys going to turn a cold shoulder to him because of that
1648479 depression is kind of an intimate type of thing you dont want people really knowing about that it doesnt have to be public information
1648480 you win with guys like max max is a fighter
1648481 were not even in the middle of training camp here
1648482 im here for him but as a player i have to do what i have to do to make this team
1648483 there has never been a fighter who remained this good this deep into his career as bernard hopkins has done it almost seems like he doesnt age at all
1648484 you have to make him fight 3 minutes of every round
1648485 eventually were going to get to bernard and wear him down i actually see this fight going like the one between miguel cotto and antonio margarito i called that one right i saw margarito as the stronger guy the aggressor the guy who kept coming forward and throwing nonstop punches
1648486 look the rings only so big bernard is a master of defense but i dont see him withstanding what kellys going to put on him for 12 hard tough rounds at some point hes going to crack and then well have him
1648487 im looking for kelly pavlik to bring his a game and im going to come with mine
1648488 this is the best fighting the best kelly pavlik didnt have to take this fight and i didnt have to ask for it so lets do it
1648489 as far as im concerned this is like two blue collar guys construction workers fighting over the last sandwich after a hard 9 hours of work
1648490 a w is a w getting a win over bernard hopkins is a great accomplishment do we want to win convincingly yeah but i really dont think theres any pressure on me i know im going to win
1648491 we cant lose the majority of these games when we play the marlins and the mets
1648492 weve got to win some of these games weve got to play a little bit better than 500 in these games
1648493 i really dont know if i gave them a chance to do that
1648494 i think my command was so poor tonight that really didnt matter
1648495 i think that its definitely new to him and it would take him a while to really get used to the bullpen
1648496 but i tell you since they got johnson and sanchez back that definitely makes their rotation solid theyre a good team
1648497 that is what replay is going to be there for and replay is coming very soon i cant give you a date but its going to be this year
1648498 there are a lot of factors in replay that i could go on and on about there are a lot of ballparks that are not umpire friendly when it comes to border calls thats how they build them theyre fan friendly and they dont want to change that
1648499 do we like that no but you know what were losing that war so well accept it and well move on and deal with however major league baseball wants us to deal with it and thats about all i can say about it but victorinos line drive is a perfect example of why they want replay
1648500 i look at it now and it looks like it just went foul just missed the pole foul ball after talking to the guys nobody was 100 percent sure one way or the other were not going to flip a call unless weve got it 100 percent
1648501 he goes i dont know i think you missed it but i dont know and he was the closest guy to it
1648502 from a technical standpoint why wouldnt we want to get the play right it seems like we were kind of behind the times and everybody knew what the call was except for the four guys umpires on the field
1648503 both cuz in order to have a bad beat that means you actually have to have good cards to lose with so i think its kinda worse if you have no cards and still get a bad beat cooler
1648504 just buy a piece of raw liver and shove it up inside you it will make you tight and he will never know the difference
1648505 can you train my dog and are you a good trainer
1648506 well i can train your dog and i will give you a demonstration of how good i am

1648514 set of methods aimed at improving the ranking of a website in search engine listings
1648515 i would say i dont think it will be long term because i see how different i feel now from the day it started getting worse
1648516 i feel much better now so i dont think it will be too long i hope
1648517 im just going to get after it and go as hard as i can for as long as i can
1648518 this entire case rests upon the statement of adam pacman jones
1648519 after making a deal with the state where felony charges were dismissed so that he could get himself reinstated with the nfl
1648520 guys want big raises and incentives kick in but well get matt signed
1648521 this is not only a great day for tony but also a great day for the school
1648522 committing this early will only keep him focused and thats what we need him to be
1648523 ill never forget when he hit that three point shot in ot to beat dematha his freshman year
1648524 people couldnt believe he took that shot but thats just the kind of kid he is fearless
1648525 many times itll be a hard practice hell be harrassed hell have to move a little bit more than normal hell have to make tighter throws in the long run thats good for him
1648526 because right now my season with just two wins is i think just ok but if i were to come through and win this event it would make an ok year a great one
1648527 winning the last major could turn it into something special
1648528 im imagining it probably wasnt too nice were they complimenting my outfit i obviously didnt like the way i finished but i was so glad that i was in a position where every shot counted and mattered in a pressure situation heading into this event
1648529 but i felt like i hit a lot of good shots so i cant get too disappointed because there wasnt any one thing that was deficient
1648530 from a players point of view i dont really notice tigers absence too much
1648531 the atmosphere for the competition seems to be the same and everybodys into their own games trying to get their best out of them
1648532 i am glad i brought this monster to its knees
1648533 its the greatest test of golf i have ever played
1648534 the toughest set of greens we play in major championship golf
1648535 so i dont know i couldnt tell you why i think that i have no particular reason
1648536 i think i will be ready but unfortunately you cant be 100 percent sure until you actually tee it up and play but i believe i can do it im pretty comfortable with the test ahead
1648537 that wouldnt weigh on me at all that gives you something to write about this is about playing your best golf and seeing if you come out on top
1648538 there will always be somebody missing it doesnt work like that you can only win the tournament youre playing in you can only win the week youre playing and you can only beat the field thats there so at the end of the day it doesnt matter whos here
1648539 the last 15 years maybe theres been a little bit of a lull in european golf in terms of winning majors but obviously theres plenty of good european players around now and theres plenty of them capable of winning
1648540 i feel like i need to be turning that water into wine
1648541 im going to have to be very careful cautious with handling this bullpen situation
1648542 i dont want to discourage anyone but at the same time i want people to step up
1648543 strict adherence to objectivity and balance in all programs of a controversial nature
1648544 strict adherence to objectivity and balance in all programs or series of programs of a controversial nature
1648545 impose firm objectivity and balance standards on public television and radio
1648546 is a welcome development i fear that it could detract from the cpbs legal requirement to directly exercise its objectivity and balance oversight of public broadcasters
1648547 camera applauds rep cantor for reminding cpb of something of primary importance to public broadcasting listeners and viewers not to mention the ultimate stakeholders in this issue taxpayers
1648548 that is that the laws creating the corporation for public broadcasting and providing for federal funding have long required cpb to exercise direct objectivity and balance oversight on behalf of congress and the public its past time that the corporation began upholding its obligation
1648549 public broadcasting law prohibits pre broadcast censorship and it also assumes post broadcast reviews so that chronic violators such as npr national public radio with its israel would be put on notice and if improvement was not made future funding requests would be more closely scrutinized rep cantors reminder to cpb that it must uphold the objectivity and balance requirement is most timely
1648550 to give up the rootless and drifting feeling of not belonging that i always felt in america
1648551 wat een affreus gedrocht is me dat hier voor mij en dan die kleur zon soort beige wordt niet meer gemengd sinds de jaren zeventig daar waar het in combinatie met grasgroen en pekesoranje en gegoten in monsterlijke bloemvormen op behangpapier een hele generatie heeft doen afzien en dat komt zomaar terug in het volgende millenium mijn ogen bezoedelen er is iets mis met die achterkant ook jom ik kan er niet meteen mijn vinger opleggen maar aaargh mottig mottig mottig
1648552 recent data suggested that the slowdown has taken a firmer hold of the economy and the olympics may present some downside risks
1648553 as the domestic and external uncertainties rise worries about a sharper than expected economic slowdown loom large and the government has changed its tone on macro policy recently
1648554 when i was in high school when i was running it was like an out of body experience
1648555 when we were younger growing up him throwing the ball to me it was natural hed want to keep it that way
1648556 you wont catch me doing something because i have bills
1648557 when you get caught get suspended they cut your money if i was to test positive for something that stops my money then what am i going to do if i was to get second all my life working hard doing it naturally thats just what i am
1648558 something like that makes you look at life a different way
1648559 we undertook a world class research effort to discover why that might have happened
1648560 they cant keep making golf courses longer because not every course has a 20 million budget
1648561 and they cant keep us from hitting the ball far because theres enough engineers and r amp d and technology that keeps us getting longer if you can limit the amount of spin on the ball and make the guy play from the fairway its probably a good avenue
1648562 i love the way in which marcus says stuff confidently assuredly and quite often with a sense of mischief

1648570 err yea we can be a frightfully ignorant bunch sometimes
1648571 post and ive got to say im really thankful for all the sugestions that have been flowing in even if a lot of them are basic iterations of

1648573 bones show which i decide to start watching last minute which eventually turns out to be one of my favourites from the season
1648574 maybe its because the shows on my watchlist now are all laidback enjoy as they come shows but that was generally the impression i got from this episode around the moment started playing best op
1648575 i have no doubt in my mind that the leadership of parties will assert itself and we will take the legislative agenda forward in areas where we agree
1648576 we have serious reservations about the legitimacy of this government
1648577 even if one could expect some forward movement in policy changes for the insurance sector reforms other policy initiatives such as higher foreign investment limits have less to do with what is perceived to be economic reforms and more to do with pressures exerted by lobbies within india and abroad
1648578 the government is already under attack for the nuclear deal with the u s and may not do anything that will be seen as an outcome of lobbying by pressure groups such as american insurance companies
1648579 the next general elections have to be held by april but could take place earlier
1648580 the policy priorities of the government will be focused on containing inflation and little else since it is in election mode
1648581 the government would be foolish to sell shares now and be accused by its political opponents of selling family silver at a cheap rate
1648582 and my superficial fan will instantly gravitate me to the show

1648588 in the absence of a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for in our extended package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive
1648589 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next steps before i get in front of them
1648590 we dont have the decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1648591 given the fact that it is the second of two adjectives modifying the term maximizer we cannot agree that the word climax retains such an elevated status when one is looking to identify the most salient feature of the composite for purposes of discerning commercial impression and connotation
1648592 the meaning prospective consumers acquainted with both marks would draw from registrants mark is that registrants listed product offers the more intense or maximized experience available from the respective climax products
1648593 when used alone by applicant in the context of adult sex toys the word climax appears suggestive of the ultimate intended effect of the goods
1648594 are somewhat weak as applied to these goods and when viewed in their entireties we find that the respective marks are not confusingly similar

1648609 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves

1648615 i have always thought that the congestion charge is a blunt instrument it has proved successful in cutting traffic coming into london but on its own has not resolved the problem of congestion various works and schemes going on in the capital have also eroded its impact i am therefore introducing a more comprehensive approach to easing congestion in london
1648616 congestion would be a lot worse were it not for the charge
1648617 tfl needs to manage the roadworks better which is plainly possible traffic lights can also be rephased by giving less green time to pedestrians and more to traffic
1648618 without the congestion charge the traffic problems in london would be much worse however as a result of other interventions such as utility and construction works the reduction in road space has had a detrimental impact on congestion levels and is slowing traffic down
1648619 i hope this brings you the closure that you seek
1648620 i think the u s is in a very difficult position now because of the obstruction and belligerance of the state of texas

1648656 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects
1648657 however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1648658 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
1648659 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal
1648660 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner
1648661 most of these kids meals appear to be designed to put americas children on the fast track to obesity disability heart attack or diabetes
1648662 but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardize future treatment for mothers and infants
1648663 it reinforces the need to treat these women with combination therapy thereby providing better prevention for the infant while providing better treatment for the mother
1648664 public health efforts should continue to expand combination therapy so that mothers and babies arent left vulnerable to drug resistance
1648665 it is hard to diagnose the anemia of chronic disease
1648666 having an assay for hepcidin would make it much easier and it would also help in diagnosing iron overload diseases
1648667 endometriosis occurs when cells of the inner lining of the womb are found growing outside of the uterus
1648668 we found the telomere a region at the end of all chromosomes that prevents the chromosome destroying itself during cell division is abnormally long in women with endometriosis
1648669 our research shows however that cells in the lining of the womb are unique in that they can express this enzyme in the early stages of the menstrual cycle when cell division is important but not during the latter stages when implantation of the fertilised embryo becomes a priority
1648670 women who have endometriosis express this enzyme in both the early and late stages of the menstrual cycle which means that the cells will continue to divide and lose their focus in supporting the establishment of a pregnancy as a result the lining of the womb may be more hostile to an early pregnancy and the cells that are shed at this late stage in the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive and more able to survive and implant outside the uterus causing pain in the pelvic or abdomen area
1648671 this research can benefit parents teachers and other individuals working with children as it can allow them to set realistic expectations for and better interpret childrens everyday behavior
1648672 this study demonstrates how remedial instruction can use the plasticity of the human brain to gain an educational improvement
1648673 focused instruction can help underperforming brain areas to increase their proficiency
1648674 any kind of education is a matter of training the brain when poor readers are learning to read a particular brain area is not performing as well as it might and remedial instruction helps to shape that area up
1648675 this finding shows that poor readers can be helped to develop buff brains a similar approach should apply to other skills
1648676 we are at the beginning of a new era of neuro education
1648677 our model is proposing a way that the brain processes temporal information and how this can vary over time
1648678 positive excitatory feedback originating from recurrent connections between the cells
1648679 it seems like when youre in a more flexible brain state its easier for you to redirect your attention to new and important things
1648680 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1648681 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1648682 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1648683 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease
1648684 because herbs and spices have a very low calorie content and are relatively inexpensive theyre a great way to get a lot of antioxidant and anti inflammatory power into your diet
1648685 if you set up a good herb and spice cabinet and season your food liberally you could double or even triple the medicinal value of your meal without increasing the caloric content
1648686 culinary herbs and spices are all generally recognized as safe and have been time tested in the diet
1648687 indeed some of spices and herbals are now sold as food supplements because of their recognized health benefits
1648688 when you add herbs and spices to food you definitely provide yourself with additional benefits besides taste
1648689 people have a hard time adhering to diets and our research shows that choosing eggs for breakfast can dramatically improve the success of a weight loss plan
1648690 apparently the increased satiety and energy due to eggs helps people better comply with a reduced calorie diet
1648691 eggs are a good source of all natural high quality protein so they can help keep you satisfied longer making it easier to resist tempting snacks
1648692 nearly half of an eggs protein and many of the other nutrients are found in the yolk so make sure to eat the whole egg for maximum benefits
1648693 food allergic individuals need to increase the awareness of their food allergy among the people around them
1648694 this would include not only telling them that they are food allergic but also showing them how to treat them and how to recognize signs of an ongoing reaction
1648695 there are serious issues that need to be addressed in terms of educating these young adults that it is of utmost importance to not only maintain emergency medication but to have it with you at all times
1648696 until all students who display symptoms of a severe reaction are receiving epinephrine i would say that theres a significant gap that needs to be closed
1648697 repeated commit or defer decisions with a deadline the influenza vaccine composition
1648698 first that the fda should be willing to consider deferring a decision about which strains to include if early conclusive evidence isnt available
1648699 second the fda should reexamine its commitment to the rigid structure of the vaccine with exactly one strain from each of three categories for example if theres agreement on choosing two of the strains and disagreement about which strain to pick for the third why not include four
1648700 our hypothesis was that certain non toxic dietary agents that had the ability to promote reactive oxygen species ros would break down pancreatic cancer cell resistance to therapy following administration of mda 7 il 24 and be safe for human use
1648701 we are very excited at the prospect of this chemoprevention gene therapy as a means of both preventing and treating pancreatic cancer and it has significant potential to move rapidly into human clinical trials
1648702 it is hard to diagnose the anemia of chronic disease
1648703 having an assay for hepcidin would make it much easier and it would also help in diagnosing iron overload diseases
1648704 the assay can be used to easily measure hepcidin in the blood of all vertebrates
1648705 our duck billed dinosaur grew three to five times faster than any potential predators that lived alongside it
1648706 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference
1648707 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set
1648708 we were shocked at how fast they grew if you look at a cross section of the bone of a nestling or even from within the egg there are huge spaces in which blood supply was going through the bone which means they were growing like crazy
1648709 this study is a stepping stone to a larger comparative study on community changes that impacted dinosaur evolution
1648710 unexpressed concerns can keep patients from accepting recommended surgeries that may be very beneficial for them
1648711 if patients dont bring up concerns with their orthopaedic surgeon then the opportunity to help is missed for example if a patients unexpressed concern is based on incorrect information a surgeon will be hard pressed to help
1648712 our study also found that many patients do not mention worries about their capacity to meet the demands of surgery especially in the post operative period likely thinking that the surgeon cannot help but orthopaedic surgeons may be able to direct patients to social workers and other professional staff who can
1648713 patients are individuals not the left shoulder in room 2 but sometimes orthopaedic surgeons become so technically focused that we forget to develop that necessary personal relationship
1648714 about 20 to 30 percent of patients who undergo a knee or hip replacement end up having someone else do the surgery because they didnt feel a personal connection was established in that first meeting with the orthopaedic surgeon
1648715 improved communication skills can be learned and even small changes can make a big difference
1648716 this research strongly supports our programs emphasis on specific techniques that allow us to be more empathetic with our patients since the average orthopaedic surgeon sees 160 000 patients during his or her career aaos communicaton skills workshops can have a significant impact on patient care
1648717 is there something else you want to talk about today
1648718 there are potential therapeutic benefits associated with simply allowing for the expression of these concerns
1648719 listening to our patients demonstrates a willingness on the part of the surgeon to engage in a dialogue with patients that supports their decision making
1648720 simply offering some empathy and reassurance can go a long way in easing a patients concerns about surgery
1648721 one of the biggest challenges in the fight against influenza is producing new vaccines every year
1648722 currently only 40 percent of health care workers in the united states are vaccinated against influenza
1648723 he had end stage heart failure and was at the brink of death when he arrived output from his heart could not be maintained even though he was receiving maximum intravenous medications in the icu
1648724 we had to implant the device in an emergency operation he was then able to go home to wait for a donor heart and kidney to become available
1648725 i was scared and happy and surprised at the same time
1648726 he is a young guy with a great family without the transplants he would not have the quality of life that he now can expect and without the pump he would not have survived at all
1648727 our staff and transplant coordinators make every effort to help resolve financial insurance and funding issues and its very rewarding for us to see that patients receive the medical care they need
1648728 the phase iib data show great potential for tmc278 as a once daily treatment option for patients who have not previously taken anti hiv medications
1648729 we are continuing to investigate this promising once daily therapy in two pivotal phase iii trials which will be conducted in africa asia europe north america and south america
1648730 until now the only option for transplant patients has been to take a cocktail of drugs for the rest of their lives
1648731 these drugs can cause severe side effects and cannot always prevent the slow destructive process of chronic rejection which often leads to the failure of the transplanted organ
1648732 that is why our use of transplant acceptance inducing cells taics in kidney transplant patients is such an exciting development as it could eventually offer patients who have had transplant surgery a much higher quality of life free from complex drug regimes
1648733 although our use of taics is still in the preliminary stages the results of our clinical trials on 17 kidney transplant patients are promising
1648734 we concluded that although the stage one trial showed that taic therapy was both safe and clinically practicable the trial was unable to provide evidence that postoperative taic administration has a beneficial effect
1648735 although our stage two clinical trial did not provide conclusive evidence of a beneficial effect of pre operative taics treatment the results were encouraging
1648736 they suggest that taics promote a physical state that might allow us to minimize the drugs we use to stop the patients immune system from rejecting their new organ
1648737 our research clearly shows that infusing taics into patients before they have a kidney transplant or after the procedure has been carried out is a practical and safe clinical option
1648738 although this procedure is still being developed and refined it poses an exciting possibility for clinicians and patients alike
1648739 humans seem to be wired to look to faces to understand the persons intentions
1648740 people are always asking themselves does this person have good or bad intentions
1648741 if you can think of an emotion being communicated by the face as a kind of signal you can understand that we can amplify that signal into what was almost a caricature to see if we get the proper effect
1648742 we strongly suspect that dogs with chronic coccidioidomycosis have a reduction in their immune surveillance capacity which permits the fungus to survive valley fever can have catastrophic consequences in dogs and humans and we are confident that our immune restoration approach will lead to new treatment options

1648744 the science of extracting useful information from large data sets or databases
1648745 although both amyloid b and tau are essentially associated with etiology by various laboratories the observed decrease in oxidative damage with amyloid b and tau accumulation suggests rather a mechanism of survival moreover as a consequence of age related oxidative stress there is an upregulation of phosphorylated tau and amyloid b that result in nft and senile plaques respectively both lesions serve antioxidant functions and limit age related neuronal dysfunction however in ad this age related oxidative stress is compounded by metabolic and metallic sources of oxidant stress that despite greatly enhancing amyloid b production and tau phosphorylation lead to neurodegeneration and consequent dementia in light of these observations efforts aimed solely at eliminating amyloid b appear short sighted
1648746 instead living cells from a biopsy are treated in culture immediately after being removed from the patient
1648747 our data indicate that the protein signaling pathways that control cellular activity are different in each patients tumor
1648748 this novel trial will test a large series of targeted inhibitors alone and in unique combinations which block key signaling pathways in the tumor cells this is a key first step toward true individualized therapy for multiple myeloma
1648749 since this information underpins the growth and survival of the cancer cells we hypothesize that turning patient specific signaling activation off will kill the tumor cells more effectively than the current treatment
1648750 in this initial study we will test promising new treatments that may be candidates for phase i or ii clinical treatment research trials
1648751 this is an example of serendipity and opportunity and that is what makes america a special place where good people and good ideas garner support from pluralistic sources

1648753 pharmacists already play an important role in the provision of sexual health services and have done so for many years reclassifying azithromycin will expand on existing services and improve access to chlamydia screening and treatment for patients
1648754 chlamydia infection rates are increasing particularly in those under 25 years of age the development of appropriate sexual health services for this group should result in higher rates of detection of sexually transmitted infections and improved awareness of the importance of practising safe sex

1648756 our commitment to creating innovative devices and technology to help physicians perform minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for aortic aneurysms that improve patient outcomes and make the benefits of evar available to an ever widening cohort of patients is revolutionizing the industry and creating a new gold standard for the treatment of this life threatening disease
1648757 exciting and underscore the extremely bright future for this cutting edge technology
1648758 the positive outcomes in this trial pave the way for randomised multi centre clinical trials using mesoblasts allogeneic or unrelated donor cells
1648759 good results are likely to be seen with allogeneic cells as there should be reproducibility of outcomes and enhanced dosage predictability using a batched product derived from a young healthy donor
1648760 these results clearly show that our proprietary stem cell technology is safe and effective for speeding up bone fracture repair there is a clear need for a minimally invasive highly effective therapy to accelerate fracture repair and treat or prevent non union and we believe that mesoblasts technology is ideally suited to deliver such a product
1648761 vivitrol is the first once monthly injectable medication for the treatment of alcohol dependence to be approved in russia the long acting non addictive formulation ensures that patients get the benefit of medication over the entire month
1648762 with vivitrol physicians will have a new medication option to help treat patients with alcohol dependence and patients have new hope to help them in their battle with this devastating disease
1648763 a novel arsenical has antitumor activity toward as2o3 resistant and mrp1 abcc1 overexpressing cell lines
1648764 this study suggests that darinaparsin may have a broader therapeutic spectrum than inorganic arsenic as it is less affected by the resistance mechanisms of certain cancer cells
1648765 the successful application of a treatment that offers inorganic arsenics efficacy in acute promyelocytic leukemia to other more common malignancies would be significant i look forward to seeing more data from ongoing clinical and pre clinical studies
1648766 weve seen an incredible scale up of funding for vaccine microbicide and other hiv prevention research over the past eight years
1648767 this funding invigorated the field and allowed researchers to move critical projects and clinical trials forward going forward it is essential that funders remain committed to hiv prevention research
1648768 results in recent microbicide and vaccine trials have led a few critics to suggest rethinking government funding for biomedical prevention research this report argues that support from all sectors will be needed as we continue the search for all potentially effective new hiv prevention options
1648769 government funding and government programs have given us important advances in prevention research and remain critical for moving hiv prevention research and development forward
1648770 the aids epidemic continues to ravage communities around the world we desperately need new prevention options such as vaccines and microbicides to help people remain uninfected
1648771 hiv prevention research is an essential investment funding for the development of these new tools must be sustained and spent strategically
1648772 the world desperately needs new hiv prevention options to help stop new hiv infections funding research and development of new vaccines and microbicides must remain a priority as we scale up towards universal access to hiv prevention and treatment
1648773 with nearly three new infections occurring for every single person put on treatment the potential lifesaving benefits of vaccines and microbicides make the investment worthwhile funding at all stages of r amp d from basic research to efficacy trials must remain a global priority
1648774 it is very important for women to be involved in clinical research so we can better understand efficacy and tolerability of antiretroviral therapy in women
1648775 this subanalysis of the castle study has made a significant contribution to that understanding
1648776 sex of adults and adolescents with hiv aids diagnosed during 2006
1648777 this club offers pharmacy patients exceptional value with its broad range of drugs covered competitive pricing and superior convenience of our 6 300 locations
1648778 weve put together a truly complete solution that goes well beyond just offering good prices on a few drugs we give patients the security and peace of mind of having all their prescriptions with one pharmacy thats always nearby
1648779 after my pharmacist printed out a list of prices for my prescriptions under the plan and i compared them side by side with what i was paying joining the club seemed like a no brainer
1648780 im glad i took the advice ive already saved about 120 over the last three months
1648781 people are facing challenging economic times and were helping them save money without compromising the safety service and convenience they value
1648782 what we are talking about here are two prominent apolitical hiv aids physicians who are internationally recognized for their humanitarian efforts and work to improve public health
1648783 it is of special concern that these two doctors whose whereabouts remain unknown disappeared prior to the international aids conference iac in mexico city where they were scheduled to speak about irans hiv aids prevention and treatment programs
1648784 arash and kamiar were sorely missed at the international aids conference and their absence is a striking reminder of the ongoing difficulties faced by people who are actively fighting hiv aids in many parts of the world
1648785 as a muslim woman i call on the iranian government to release these brothers and allow them to continue their vital work
1648786 with so many people already diagnosed with conditions that can lead to kidney disease such as diabetes and high blood pressure educating the community is more important than ever
1648787 unfortunately far too many people dont recognize the warning signs until its too late
1648788 early detection and treatment are the best tools for slowing or halting the progression of kidney disease
1648789 during kidney disease awareness and education week we are trying to make policy makers and the general public more aware of kidney disease treatment options and related legislative issues
1648790 this guide distills our experiences over the past two decades from a wide range of international hiv aids efforts with a special focus on sub saharan africa
1648791 in this new era of expanded funding a documentation of lessons being learned in addition to the latest knowledge concerning the evolving science of implementing care programs in resource constrained settings is critically important
1648792 from the ground up is a testament to the importance of working together highlighting how greater collaboration and communication can enable those working on the front lines to mount new and more effective responses to the hiv aids crisis
1648793 while the road ahead is sure to be challenging learning from the experiences of our colleagues can help us to end the aids pandemic and come closer to an hiv free generation
1648794 we are delighted that the physio l r artificial disc prosthesis has received ce mark approval
1648795 this represents an important milestone in our plan to launch a full range of artificial disc prostheses based on our proprietary elastomeric disc technology
1648796 the fact that the physio l r is the first of the next generation elastomeric lumbar discs to receive a ce mark makes this approval even more exciting
1648797 the unique properties of the physio l r help restore the natural shock absorption of the disc
1648798 this allows the surgeon to restore function to the patients disc the clinical data for the physio l r are demonstrating outstanding improvements in both patient disability and pain supporting the concept of using elastomeric polymers for total disc prostheses
1648799 this study illustrates the impact flossing can have on oral health the twins experimental model is a powerful tool to help sort out genetic and environmental factors that often confound the interpretation of treatment studies this study demonstrates that flossing can have an important and favorable impact on an individual as compared to that of a non flossing individual with similar genetics and possibly similar habits
1648800 twins tend to share the same or similar environmental factors such as dietary habits health and life practices as well as genetics in this case the only difference was flossing and the outcome was significant flossing may significantly reduce the amount of bad bacteria in the mouth
1648801 as a practicing periodontist i am constantly telling my patients to clean between their teeth more using dental floss or interdental cleaners
1648802 patients tend to think that flossing cant possibly make that much of a difference but this study demonstrates that the addition of flossing to your dental hygiene routine can significantly reduce the amount of periodontal disease causing bacteria even after just two weeks
1648803 as we better understand the biological pathways that regulate the growth of stem cells we may identify new approaches for treating blood disorders

1648842 this new cyberknife system configuration now allows us to deliver radiosurgical quality treatments almost as fast as radiation therapy
1648843 with the cyberknife system however the entire course of therapy is completed in one to five treatments compared to the two month regimen of 30 to 40 treatments required with conventional radiation therapy the cyberknife system clearly benefits both the patient and the provider
1648844 for all radiation delivery systems plan quality and treatment time have historically had an inverse relationship
1648845 while other radiosurgery systems actively promote fast treatment times plan quality often suffers accordingly integrating all of the latest technologies cyberknife treatment times can now be reduced considerably with absolutely no sacrifice in treatment quality
1648846 we are very pleased with this new ability to efficiently deliver the highest quality state of the art radiosurgery to the tulsa community
1648847 we have yet to achieve bias free health care this has serious public health implications as we know that higher levels of screening lead to lower levels of mortality clinicians need to be aware that they may be sending signals even unintentionally that lead minorities to believe they are being discriminated against
1648848 respondents answered yes or no to was there ever a time that you would have gotten better medical care if you had belonged to a different ethnic group however we were not able to ask why they felt discriminated against
1648849 this contradicts the general assumption in public health that having a usual source of care is a cure all
1648850 if men felt discriminated against by their regular health care provider they did not receive screening so there is something else factoring in
1648851 for example african american men may be stereotyped as being more violent which would affect how doctors respond to them and thus create a potential for discrimination
1648852 the longer someone delays screening the worse the outcome perception of discrimination may be driving the differences we see in outcomes among minorities

1648923 it happened purely by accident in the first instance we were monitoring leopards in germany to try and understand their territorial patterns of hunting and mating when one of our team johan yo han noticed something quite peculiar when he was looking through some photos of leopards in our purpose built hide on an industrial estate near frankfurt he returned to the teams very comfortable dormitory rather excited and animated and proclaimed to us that the leopards seemed unable to change their spots
1648924 that right away we did not take johans wild claims very seriously so we tied him naked to the roof of the adjoining refrigeration plant we had however been drinking quite heavily but in the morning we realised he really was on to something and we began to throw ideas around which is when we came up with the idea of testing johans very same theory with humans
1648925 it was then that it became clear to us that johan had been on to something
1648926 regrettably it was four days before we were sobered up enough to remember the whole tying him onto the roof naked thing

1648986 when president bush pays a visit to pope benedict xvi at the vatican on friday it will be his sixth meeting with a pope and his third meeting with benedict in just over a year
1648987 bush has emphasized his admiration for the papacy and in particular for benedict whom he has called a very smart loving man when benedict arrived in washington in april bush personally met the pope on the tarmac the only time that bush has so honored any dignitary
1648988 less obvious is how the pope views the president it is not only benedicts relatively shy personality that prevents him from being so demonstrative but the customary reserve that his office imposes on its occupants
1648989 yet according to informed observers there is reason to believe that benedict despite some important policy differences with the president most notably over iraq feels a genuine affinity with bush as both a man and a leader for the pope part of the attraction may be found in bushs life story id imagine that he has respect for the president as a man who turned his life around had a conversion experience stopped drinking and started living a religious life reese said
1648990 benedict who has warned against the increasing secularization of europe and praised the prominent role of religion in american public life is likely to appreciate a head of state who is not afraid to express his faith as a christian said the rev joseph fessio a former student of the pope who now runs ignatius press benedicts principal english language publisher
1648991 in the president the pope finds a key supporter of the catholic churchs positions on such controversial questions as abortion stem cell research and same sex marriage
1648992 fessio agreed in terms of authentic normative catholic teaching i dont see any area in which the pope and president bush disagree he said the most notable case of disharmony between the two leaders was over the 2003 invasion of iraq which then cardinal joseph ratzinger opposed at least as ardently as pope john paul ii but iraq is not a matter of catholic social teaching fessio said likewise benedicts views on economics taxation and government regulation which are known to lie to the left of bushs are merely his personal opinions not doctrine that he holds as binding on the faithful fessio said
1648993 where does it say in the constitution that executions have to be painless

1648995 for a long time during those frightful years i waited for a great voice to speak up in rome
1648996 it has been explained to me since that the condemnation was indeed voiced
1648997 what the world expects of christians is that christians should speak out loud and clear and that they should voice their condemnation in such a way that never a doubt never the slightest doubt could rise in the heart of the simplest man
1648998 it may be that christianity will insist on maintaining a compromise or else on giving its condemnations the obscure form of the encyclical
1648999 what i know and what sometimes creates a deep longing in me is that if christians made up their mind to it millions of voices millions i say throughout the world would be added to the appeal of a handful of isolated individuals who without any sort of affiliation today intercede almost everywhere and ceaselessly for children and other people

1649001 i have no intention of reporting out of committee anytime in this session of congress any such funding request that simply serves to continue the status quo
1649002 a planned campaign intentional manipulated a desire to discredit the church
1649003 we repent of our complicity in what we believe to be the unjust and immoral invasion and occupation of iraq
1649004 we confess our preoccupation with institutional enhancement and limited agendas while american men and women are sent to iraq to kill and be killed while thousands of iraqi people needlessly suffer and die
1649005 every day that the war continues more soldiers and innocent civilians are killed with no end in sight to the violence bloodshed and carnage
1649006 the iraq war is not just a political issue or a military issue it is a moral issue
1649007 a country is not just what it does it is also what it tolerates

1649013 the senate is currently conducting an internal investigation in an attempt to discover who is behind this once we learn their identity that information will be turned over to law enforcement and we would expect it to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
1649014 i support the goal of encouraging college education for children whose parents brought them into illegally but it is unfair to reward the children of undocumented workers and favor them over the children of legal residents today i voted to bring this issue to the floor of the senate for debate with the commitment that there is still the opportunity to change the durbin bill and gain bipartisan consensus though the motion to proceed failed i will continue to work for fair and comprehensive border security and immigration reform

1649074 its a huge loss for the sport and for his friends and family
1649075 he often told me that when he had to quit which he was thinking of retiring this year he just had no idea what he would do he spent the better part of 50 years with horses he was a true traditional cowboy he just loved the sport of chuckwagon racing like nobody else

1649108 but it would also be fair to say that being the younger sister of the uks most notorious glamour model has not always made things easy for her she added
1649109 i had my car scratched with keys twice last week and whenever i go out there is always someone who has a go at me the bullying at school made me a lot stronger
1649110 it was very painful after i first had the surgery done
1649111 these well known words by just about sums up the daily movements of avid party goers
1649112 at first i thought it was just the hormones readjusting but the feelings didnt go away
1649113 i even thought our dog hated me for bringing a baby home thats how irrational i was
1649114 their postpartum physical health or emotional health interfered at least some with their ability to care for their baby
1649115 substantial proportions of mothers were still feeling stressed 43 percent had problems with weight control 40 percent experienced sleep loss 34 percent lack of sexual desire 26 percent and backache 24 percent
1649116 its a huge physical and emotional commitment to have babies and i dont think the world or this country responds in a way that recognizes the importance and vulnerability that women experience at this time
1649117 the inordinate amount of responsibility for child care these mothers must take on without support from husbands partners or others
1649118 they called and told me id scored very high on the questionnaire and that they could send someone to my house to talk with me
1649119 another female in my life i could go talk to about whether my decisions were rational or not like whether i should feel guilty about putting my baby down for a nap and letting him cry it out a little which id never felt i could
1649120 some of these women have undergone tremendous trauma while on the operating table and have experienced a real lack of caring or attention by the health care providers
1649121 and any proposals for paid maternal leave arent going to happen in this health care environment
1649122 still its important to get this stuff out to different audiences clinicians policy makers mothers and insurers
1649123 we need to need to recognize that postpartum recovery goes on longer than six weeks
1649124 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1649125 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1649126 this sport it probably happens more times than you know and guys wont admit it
1649127 its one of those things that he was strong enough to admit it and more power to him
1649128 i dont think we have any guys on this team who wouldnt want the best for shawn
1649129 i think everybody here including the coaches want the best for shawn they understand how grave the situation is were going to do everything we can to make it an easy transition and get ready for the season
1649130 in life you dont want to show weakness but youve got to do what youve got to do if you let depression get control of you youre done you might as well handle it now
1649131 im not a doctor but depression can stem from anything
1649132 money doesnt make you happy obviously he is successful he just got a new deal all those things dont necessarily make you happy
1649133 he is too good a player to have something like that lay him down other than that i dont know what kind of stigma it holds theres a lot of pressure on people in the game that outsiders really dont know about
1649134 everybody handles things differently theres a lot of other outside forces at work it was a good choice on his part to stay away heaven forbid youre going through depression and then you came to practice and got someone else hurt now youve got that on top of you too
1649135 im here for him but as a player i am going to do what i have to do to make this team
1649136 i feel sorry for him im with him but ive got to do what ive got to do
1649137 depression is something you dont want to play with when a person is depressed he needs as much support as he can get hopefully the guys who did have negative things to say about it will follow suit and rally around him
1649138 a lot of people think it cant happen this is a very tough game its a nonstop job they say off season but there really isnt an off season
1649139 the secret is to make sure that you continue to reinvest in your brands so that those brands can justify the price that consumers are willing to pay
1649140 its easier for them to pass on the dollar to people who are willing to pay
1649141 well we wont take that trip because its expensive so well go somewhere else

1649169 andy has been nothing but sensitive to shawns situation he didnt disclose this personal issue even though he has been peppered with questions about it
1649170 andy didnt find out shawn wasnt mentally prepared to go to camp until 24 hours before
1649171 i talked to andy right after that and he told me it was in shawns best interest for me to fly to little rock and assess the situation andy thought it would be best if we made shawn a doctors appointment
1649172 once we got the appointment it took a few days to find out the diagnosis that finally happened last thursday and it took a few days for shawn to feel comfortable about it
1649173 why would you not send the letter if you dont know what the problem is they didnt know until they finally got the diagnosis it was andy who suggested to me that i go meet with shawn and andy has communicated with shawn and directly with the doctor weve been working together to do whats best for shawn and whats best for the eagles

1649228 if kingsnorth is allowed to go ahead we will know that the government cannot be trusted with environmental policy or action on climate change
1649229 along with plans for airport expansion energy from coal is yet another barmy idea that has no basis in science fact or common sense as the organisers of the climate camp protest say how stupid can you be
1649230 we as a company are also very concerned about climate change which is one of the reasons why were closing the existing kingsnorth plant by the end of 2015 and planning to build a much more efficient station
1649231 the differentials between high and low carbon cars are still nothing like wide enough to make a big impact in practice
1649232 according to the governments own figures these changes will only have a very limited impact on the environment the treasury must be more ambitious
1649233 in all the treasury must do far better in communicating the details and benefits of its green tax policies
1649234 it is intrinsically unfair and unusual to introduce a new system of taxation that applies to families who have already purchased their vehicles and are unable to sell them
1649235 this is not sending out a green signal but a mean signal and is penalising many families who cannot afford to change their car
1649236 one of the most sensible ways to help deal with rising energy costs is to improve the energy efficiency of our homes
1649237 it has been estimated that householders can save up to euro 500 a year by bringing their houses up to modern energy efficiency standards

1649239 we have pulled out all the stops to make whitechapel market the first to recycle 100 of the waste it generates
1649240 we are very pleased that they have fully supported what we are trying to do here
1649241 markets by their very nature can create a lot of waste when you take into account things like packaging and food products with a relatively short shelf life
1649242 we have introduced a number of new ways that all this can be recycled and we are very excited that none of the market waste will be sent to landfill
1649243 we are aware of shawns situation through his representation agent rich moran we are monitoring the situation
1649244 the teams idea was for me to come up there the nfl is a big deal especially in philadelphia
1649245 obviously there was a situation going on if there wasnt hed have been here at camp
1649246 im glad that now hes finding help and that hell be better soon
1649247 we have a lot of good guys who can help
1649248 i think everybody here including coaches would want the best for shawn and understand be very sympathetic to his situation were going to do everything we can to make it the easiest transition and try to get him ready for the season
1649249 you never know whats on the other side of the life
1649250 family money theres a lot of other forces besides football that could affect him
1649251 this is his fifth year he knows the system he knows what he can do hes a pro bowl caliber player hes all pro
1649252 its not like guys are going to be like ah he just doesnt want to play if theres something going on and he just needed to get a handle on it i dont think anybodys going to turn a cold shoulder to him because of that
1649253 depression is kind of an intimate type of thing you dont want people really knowing about that it doesnt have to be public information
1649254 you win with guys like max max is a fighter
1649255 were not even in the middle of training camp here
1649256 im here for him but as a player i have to do what i have to do to make this team
1649257 it motivates and keeps people attentive but clearly when the economy is down it is something to which people react to
1649258 they have to work two to three jobs to make ends meet
1649259 take a step back and be as realistic as they can
1649260 do they feel things are out of control are they overwhelmed where can they make changes generally dont try to control things you cant
1649261 take a walk relax exercise keep track of your sleep habits dont get lost watching tv eating junk food or drinking too much just to feel better
1649262 people recommend finding another job but that is not always easy to do and moving is stressful too it is still putting someone out of a routine
1649263 if people are ruminating about it their situation over and over and dont have an opportunity to get away from it they should seek some professional evaluation
1649264 they should keep their r sum up to date and keep their employment network in the picture
1649265 many americans are unaware that discarded electronics contain lead mercury and other toxics and end up being salvaged under inhumane conditions in the developing world
1649266 i am encouraged by the effort to improve e waste recycling in the us but progress is an illusion when recycling means exporting e waste to be picked over by scavengers under hazardous conditions
1649267 if the epa cannot or will not act to halt the toxic e waste trade to developing nations then congress should take action
1649268 to make insights to come up with ideas patent them and then license them to interested companies

1649278 i reduced my calorie intake from 1800 to 1300 per day with only n grams of fat per meal i added an additional hour per week of exercise beyond the 3 hours i was doing i expect to lose about 1 pound per week over the next 20 weeks to attain my goal of x pounds
1649279 i called up a bunch of purchasing managers to see if they needed any aluminum
1649280 this month i am targeting purchasing managers in the machine tools field within 150 miles of our main plant who have returned my questionnaire about the tradeoffs between fast turnaround aluminum products vs cost my goal is to increase sales to this market by 15 by the end of q2
1649281 in just seven months the organization was able to reduce the manufacturing cost per wafer by 12 percent and the cycle time the time it takes to turn a blank silicon wafer into a finished wafer full of logic chips by 67 percent it did all this without investing in new equipment or changing the product design or technical specifications and this short experiment has exposed only the tip of the iceberg
1649282 heavens this is a major plant run by a major manufacturer wont say who i thought this kind of plant was already ruthlessly efficient you mean they dont even know how many wafers they have in the fab yes that is one of the questions the team suggests asking apparently that is only one of a litany of seemingly obvious data routinely tracked in such environments but the miracle is that such amazing improvements can be wring out of such granular simple straightforward and relatively easy to obtain data this is not he first time this blog has explored the astounding results that flow from some fairly specifying
1649283 new concepts and systems whose feasibility is still unknown and risky
1649284 we search for those ideas world wide that may make a tremendous difference and whose time has come to bring them to the near side as fast as possible

1649297 after 12 years of inaction under the previous government we are the first federal government to enter the water market to tackle over allocation in the murray darling basin
1649298 the tender process is an effective way to purchase water for rivers and wetlands at a price which is acceptable to both the buyer the australian community and the seller
1649299 unfortunately there is currently just not enough water in the system to do everything we want to do
1649300 all the 50m has bought is a promise in the future of water
1649301 it has bought air space it will not put any water in the murray river at this time
1649302 the present situation is a mess of bureaucracy and buck passing
1649303 current government policy is waste to energy and thermal treatment is okay as long as you generate heat and power from it
1649304 theres very few new landfills being opened and the waste that cant be recycled has to go somewhere
1649305 i think many people will look to make cuts at this time
1649306 it would seem the obvious thing to do cut the costs and worry about some of these issues later on when the market recovers
1649307 but in fact if you think about what needs to be addressed its all good business that should be addressed today why waste electricity if you can cut the bill now its good business
1649308 if you think about this less as adding things to a building which appears to be expensive and think about the impact of what you are doing which is to waste fewer resources to waste less energy thats going to deliver more benefits
1649309 for too long many governments businesses and individuals have been wary of committing to action on climate change because they perceive that china the worlds largest emitter is doing little to address the issue
1649310 however the reality is that chinas government is beginning to unleash a low carbon dragon which will power its future growth development and energy security objectives
1649311 china is beginning to pull its weight on climate change and the targets and policies in place are in line with those being taken by leading countries like the uk and germany
1649312 the relationship was consensual and it ended earlier this year after a period of some months
1649313 i take responsibility for my being involved in this relationship and i regret the hurt caused to anyone including my family
1649314 i feel this statement is warranted to put the facts in context given the media interest
1649315 i have medical advice that i am suffering from depression and have been for some time
1649316 when that process is completed the department will advise me and i will advise the tasmanian public

1649327 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1649328 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1649329 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1649330 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1649331 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1649332 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
1649333 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
1649334 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1649335 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
1649336 i certainly think the building industry needs to be grappling with the need for training that can sensibly upskill the workforce to deliver and thats the major log jam in the industry
1649337 theres a lot of training going on at the moment thats largely irrelevant and is dealing with building issues of the past
1649338 we will be raising awareness of different modular offsite construction models that can deliver low carbon solutions right now
1649339 it does mean for a lot of the building industry changing mindsets and thats the difficult part
1649340 im going to get there as soon as my doctor says its ok to go back

1649349 just a few days ago the european commission withdrew hundreds of millions of euro which means that according to the union european taxpayers money was not being spent correctly by the bulgarian cabinet leaving aside hints of corruption among bulgarian authorities in that context we have to ask ourselves the question what is being done with bulgarian taxpayers money
1649350 we obviously want to ship action streams in both typepad and vox since we see them as such an incredible feature stay tuned and well let everyone know when it happens
1649351 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
1649352 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
1649353 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1649354 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1649355 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1649356 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1649357 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1649358 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1649359 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1649360 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1649361 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
1649362 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1649363 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1649364 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1649365 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1649366 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1649367 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1649368 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1649369 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
1649370 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1649371 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1649372 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1649373 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1649374 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1649375 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1649376 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1649377 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1649378 det k nns s otroligt f rv ntansfullt och anledningen till det r att tjejerna ser s j dra bra ut det ser s harmoniskt ut spelarna k nner sig s trygga och n jda ver att vi har spelat bra s l nge nu det r sk n st mning i g nget
1649379 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1649380 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1649381 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1649382 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1649383 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1649384 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

1649388 justins blog is sexy but certainly not as sexy as the man himself
1649389 all the doggie pictures make me want to get out my blender
1649390 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1649391 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1649392 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1649393 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1649394 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1649395 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1649396 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1649397 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1649398 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1649399 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1649400 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1649401 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1649402 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1649403 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1649404 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1649405 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1649406 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1649407 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1649408 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1649409 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1649410 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1649411 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1649412 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

1649428 the company is focused on gaining fda approval of surfaxin r by providing the fda with the additional information outlined in the may 1 approvable letter and clarified in our june 18 meeting current assessment of our timelines and plans continues to support the submission of our complete response to the approvable letter and assuming a class 1 review period potential fda approval for surfaxin in 2008 while we work to achieve this milestone we are diligently managing our financial resources planning a cash burn from operations capital expenditures and debt service of 7 0 million for the third quarter and have already offset a significant portion of this burn with the judicious use of the ceff
1649429 second quarter results highlight our emphasis on residential solar power installations and the continued growth in that market second quarter revenues of 7 1 million reflect a 6 5 sequential increase in residential installations but were overshadowed by a decline of 79 in commercial installations
1649430 although our pipeline of commercial jobs has never been larger because commercial installations span multiple quarters we expect to see continued revenue volatility as commercial projects become a larger portion of our revenue mix on the cost side we reduced cash g amp a operating expenses by 0 6 million during the quarter a greater amount than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter and have reduced headcount by 36 positions since the beginning of the year we remain on track to remove a total of 2 million in cash expenses by year end compared to our original plan
1649431 to help cash strapped consumers purchase a solar power system they now have a range of financing options including residential power purchase agreements ppas leases and home equity lines commercial customers continue to take advantage of ppa financing to purchase their systems
1649432 as part of our strategy of pursuing market segments in which we have a competitive advantage we introduced the andalay flat roof system during the quarter optimized for large commercial flat roofs this new andalay system satisfies an unmet need for a highly reliable flat roof installation that is lightweight very quick to install and does not require a myriad of potentially leaky roof penetrations in the residential market andalay panels continue to maintain their premium pricing in addition to receiving several industry awards for andalay we also received u s patent 7 406 800 covering certain key claims of our technology
1649433 despite the prolonged uncertainty about the passage of the investment tax credit itc interest in solar power shows no signs of abating our backlog at the end of the second quarter was 13 6 million bookings are at record levels and our pipeline of residential and commercial projects continues to grow and extend into the first half of 2009 still there is no question that economic weakness and the delay in the passage of the itc is impeding industry growth this year
1649434 we now expect to grow revenue in 2008 between 30 and 40 over 2007 with the growth rate contingent on the number of commercial jobs completed before the itc expires at the end of 2008 our growing backlog and expanding pipeline of both residential and commercial jobs gives us confidence that we have the right strategy and necessary infrastructure to capitalize on pent up demand in 2009 and achieve a profitable business model as a result we expect to achieve cash breakeven in the second half of 2009 assuming passage of the itc in early 2009
1649435 the demand for our products and services remains strong as our backlog continues to grow from previous periods
1649436 despite the slight sequential decline the second quarter was an important quarter for t 3 energy and it set the stage for what we believe will be a successful second half of the year this is demonstrated by our strong closing backlog t 3 energy continues to execute on our strategic growth plan as our results demonstrate most importantly we continue to gain recognition as a name brand original equipment manufacturer and service provider on an international scale and we remain steadily committed to providing responsive value to our customers
1649437 nasdaq omx delivered solid results during the quarter on the strength of our diversified business model
1649438 weve made excellent progress on the integration of omx and now expect this transaction to accrete in first quarter of 2009 significantly ahead of schedule driving this acceleration is our confidence in realizing the 100 million expense synergy target by the first anniversary of closing the deal and the integration of our most recent acquisition the philadelphia stock exchange is also well underway and is expected to accrete to our shareholders by the end of 2008 as always we will continue to follow our long standing operating philosophy of leveraging massive scale against the extreme efficiency of our core technology
1649439 when looking at our results on a pro forma non gaap basis we delivered strong net income growth both sequentially and year over year
1649440 our integration with omx is moving forward better than expected and the integration of phlx is well underway despite closing the transaction only two weeks ago these integrations coupled with the planned acquisitions of the boston stock exchange and certain assets of nord pool provide us with a platform to drive continued efficiencies and improved performance this year and well into 2009 and beyond
1649441 newstar delivered strong operating performance in the second quarter as we continued to capitalize on compelling opportunities in a favorable lending environment
1649442 i believe we are among the most active lenders in the middle market and have been building share since the dislocation in the credit markets began
1649443 from a credit perspective we continue to be defensively positioned with a highly diversified portfolio focused on first lien senior debt our continued strong credit performance clearly reflects the benefits of our business model which focuses on direct origination and disciplined credit management
1649444 newstar delivered strong financial results in the second quarter led by stable margins and continued solid credit performance
1649445 the balance sheet continued to reflect conservative leverage with liquidity and funding capacity sufficient to provide the flexibility to support increasing origination volumes
1649446 the strength of our global network and industry practice diversification drove second quarter results the asia pacific region achieved record revenue and improved its operating margin compared to the first quarter offsetting softness in the americas and europe regions the life sciences business and professional services and education nonprofit industry groups each achieved record revenue quarters which along with growth in the technology and industrial practices offset weakness we saw in the financial services and consumer industry groups we are also very pleased that initiatives weve taken to increase productivity led to a new record of 1 6 million of annualized revenue per search consultant
1649447 we are confident that worldwide demand for executive talent driven in part by secular and demographic trends will continue to provide us with opportunities for growth
1649448 we expect there will be continued pockets of softness in our business in the americas and in europe but our consolidated results will highlight the advantages of being a global firm with consultants in more than 30 countries around the world specializing in many industries we are aggressively pursuing the benefit of cost savings initiatives identified in the second quarter as well as additional measures we have recently taken while balancing investments in our business that will position us to capitalize on improving market conditions
1649449 de verdad espero que este d a la pasen super genial
1649450 the outlook for growth continues to deteriorate with recession looking increasingly unavoidable
1649451 the consumer sector is bearing the brunt of the credit crisis with falling asset prices negative real wage growth and rising unemployment taking its toll on sentiment and spending
1649452 we suspect that most monetary policy committee members are still firmly in wait and see mode and in no hurry to move interest rates given the current major uncertainties surrounding both the medium term inflation and growth outlooks
1649453 there was some buying from consumers as prices fell below the key level of 60 000 yuan a tonne in shanghai

1649456 the air is escaping from the commodities bubble the funds that leapt in are now leaping out if 7 600 fails copper could fall quickly to 7 000 but markets are looking oversold a bunch of relative strength indicators are in the 20s and low 30s so we might stabilize a little before another leg lower
1649457 everyone is expanding but margins are so poor that quite a few start ups have been pushed back
1649458 it was a bad strategic move to make an offer so this should just narrow the situation
1649459 this was a cap for the potential development of omvs share price
1649460 the european commission has indicated that it would not accept commitments that omv had proposed
1649461 since other commitments would be unacceptable to omv omv has decided to withdraw the merger notification
1649462 we argue that this shows decisive management consigning the 20 per cent stake build to opportunism rather than empire building
1649463 investor angst has turned to optimism quickly and theres a feeling that things will be okay and we can move on
1649464 note that the dollars strength is not owed to the u s economys robustness but rather due to the fact that other major economies are faring worse solid u s macro fundamentals will be necessary for the dollar to retain long term support

1649483 its never the task of a party even a ruling party and even one which has won 70 percent of the popular vote to set government policy at this level of detail
1649484 otherwise the next step is for a party conference to say for example from next year the rate of corporate tax will be 27 percent and then the whole ministry of finance and everything else goes out of the window because the party has spoken on the issue thats not how it should be
1649485 and consequently just when the scorpions appear to be on a roll conducting high profile investigations bringing high profile criminals and suspected criminals to prosecution theres a move to scrap them to dissolve them and replace them with something else
1649486 so people say why is it being scrapped people are looking for a cogent answer and most people think there has not been a cogent reason given and in our view they are correct in saying that
1649487 when you have one expert commentator after another one ngo working in the field of crime and security after another coming along and commenting and saying something is going wrong here the reasons put forward are not good enough that which is to replace this unit does not seem up to the job then
1649488 and i dont think that the memorandums to the bills or the pronouncements of politicians so far in the media do provide sufficiently cogent explanations for this change
1649489 and whats more if the new replacement unit the directorate for priority crime investigation does not come up to scratch were going to have lost an effective organisation and replaced it with something ineffective
1649490 there are several police personnel that are on the scene to ensure that all people and property are safe guarded and everything goes on smoothly

1649530 each apprentice is probably working alongside nine or so fully qualified technicians who can answer questions and give guidance because everything is so hands on i think you learn more too
1649531 although the money isnt great while youre training its still much better than building up a student debt and once youre fully qualified then you can do very well
1649532 i feel a lot of psychological pressure so many people died including my friend im at a loss what to do but i just tell myself i need to stand up by myself
1649533 they were destroyed in the quake and i donated any goods i could salvage to earthquake relief
1649534 savings have gone up by 1 5 million dollars since the quake
1649535 its because people no longer have no houses to hide their money in
1649536 people here are saying if you have money you may as well eat it now
1649537 they say there could be another earthquake tomorrow so you may as well spend all your money on food
1649538 in april there was high concern regarding tensions some were scared of clashes in the region
1649539 now there is less fear due to all these efforts
1649540 there is a set of conditions that is very dangerous and very troublesome that the u s is proving unable to manage
1649541 and because the u s was unable or unwilling to do that it created a space and an opportunity for other smaller players to take a crack at it i think this is healthy because it pushed a number of smaller states in the region to take responsibility
1649542 if the arab world had not put a strong push to stop this and to call for dialogue in doha we were definitely on the verge of a very violent and somewhat desperate civil war
1649543 i must also give some credit to syria itself and its president
1649544 for the first time in history syria has agreed to establish diplomatic relations with lebanon which means giving up its dreams of a greater syria which controls both syria and lebanon
1649545 all of this created the new atmosphere the new attitude from the international community
1649546 its a very serious step on the part of both parties
1649547 in spite of certain hopes growing up now the situation is very very very risky
1649548 because of too many contradictions in ethnicities geography history and resources
1649549 will need external help to establish itself a system for peace and security it cannot do it by its own thats why the presence of the americans is very necessary
1649550 no the only thing we need here is the seed the fertilizer and the herbicide
1649551 theyre safer on this land because there arent any insecticide residues here
1649552 if someone tells me that the government wants to limit my access to technology thats like telling me that i dont have the right to a better life or more profits and that it wants to see me sink into poverty
1649553 when you come with a genetically modified variety genes cross with other varieties and what you have is contamination
1649554 you have a strange gene in those varieties they are not what was they were before
1649555 egypt has gone ahead and approved gmo corn china has just announced a large increase in its research budget for gmo foods
1649556 he had a buyer here and i sold a 98 mercedes s320 to this guy thats been shipped to japan thats the internet power
1649557 certain mercedes benzes their sport utility vehicles are in demand in europe
1649558 japanese cars are very hot both domestically and for export
1649559 white means funerals they love dark colored cars russians love black cars light colored cars for some reason dont usually sell
1649560 no the only thing we need here is the seed the fertilizer and the herbicide
1649561 theyre safer on this land because there arent any insecticide residues here

1649578 when youre at the neshoba county fair you know youre in the heart and soul of mississippi
1649579 my opponent is the democratic national nominee for u s senator
1649580 barack obama is certainly supporting ronnie musgrove hes raising money for him working for him and wants ronnie elected
1649581 i will not go to washington d c and line up and vote lock step with the party
1649582 weve had musgrove for governor he didnt do much to help us
1649583 when reagan republican politics came to mississippi it had ripples that carried on i think now the pendulum may be swinging back
1649584 the challenge for roger wicker right now is that when people go through the checkout line or the gas station theyre not feeling warm and fuzzy
1649585 are you better off now than you were a few years ago
1649586 we started this whole terrible southern strategy idea when white democrats left and became white republicans but im hopeful that were going to spend more time in the future not talking about race but what lifts us up as one group of people
1649587 i dont think its a hard matter to figure out
1649588 we see what the ruling party has done and what a mess were in
1649589 the amazing thing about expensive sports attendance is that most often you can stay home and watch the game for free instead
1649590 how can we fans afford to pay these high ticket prices
1649591 come on out and see us live and its ok go ahead tape us making music
1649592 they want to know how high its gonna get because theyre hearing a lot of things people are talking outrageous numbers and they want to know if its true
1649593 in the early days of my career if a price moved half a cent or penny on a day that would be probably a lot
1649594 if youre within terms you can pick up oil and if youre not you can pound salt
1649595 and thats just the way it is i hope we never get to that point and have to deal with our customers that way but thats the way it is on the other side of our business
1649596 they may be buying oil at a higher price than they can sell it for or more likely the customer simply cant afford to buy it
1649597 so now they have oil they have to pay for and they cant get rid of
1649598 i think that they understand that were the middleman in this
1649599 we have probably another 10 to 20 years at least of life as we know it in the fuel business
1649600 forcefully brought home to irish consumers the prospect of tougher times ahead
1649601 gave irish consumers quite a lot to be gloomy about
1649602 rising borrowing costs and the risk of an increasing tax burden or at very least the absence of the cushion that generous budgets had provided in recent years mean the squeeze on household spending power is becoming even more painful
1649603 the sharp deterioration in the budgetary position through the first half of 2008 represents an important new negative influence on irish consumer sentiment as budget largesse has contributed forcefully to increased spending power in recent years
1649604 the re assessment of their own spending power is a more recent phenomenon
1649605 irish consumers seem to have adjusted to the macro notion of a deep and possibly lasting economic downturn now they are beginning to get to grips with the pain this implies for their pockets
1649606 jeg regner med at vi ved den ekstraordin re generalforsamling i september vil freml gge et k bstilbud p banken
1649607 det er et projekt vi arbejder med men der er ikke noget lige oppe over det vil v re super optimistisk at forvente at der er noget klar til generalforsamlingen
1649608 vi h ber da at kunne have noget klar i l bet af nogle m neder men hvorn r er umuligt at sige
1649609 i knew i wanted to make a platformer where you go from world to world and time behaves differently in each world
1649610 i knew i wanted it to have pieces of fiction to accompany each world in a style like italo calvinos invisible cities and i knew i wanted to experiment with existential difficulties like what it means for our daily existence if its possible to see the future or if time is really bi directional or if you can rewind time at will without limit to erase mistakes
1649611 i decided that the core of the game would be unlimited use of time powers
1649612 and i discarded all other rules of game design as necessary in order to preserve that core
1649613 designing the puzzles for braid felt great like a rush because they were just there waiting to be discovered after i came up with the idea for the basic time behaviour i just had to think about what strange things could happen as a result and then build situations to illustrate those things
1649614 sometimes id come up with an idea for a time behaviour and i would have to repeat ideas to fill out the world
1649615 when that happened i just cut that world from the game i cut at least two behaviours from the game or maybe three
1649616 i think a lot of players can feel that i really cared about this stuff
1649617 ive been told that the game feels like its being communicated from a very vulnerable place which seems accurate to me
1649618 its about the things that i think about the books and films referenced in the game made big impacts on me at various stages in my life super mario bros provided the core game mechanic that braid and so many other games are based on so it only seemed appropriate to reference it i wanted to take that childlike optimistic simple world blue sky feeling of super mario bros and mature it into a world that is emotionally complex lacking in certitude and possessing an existential gravitas
1649619 the game is about intellectual and emotional issues i was struggling with now that the game is done i have to some extent worked through them and im a different person now
1649620 i want to provide a game that actually respects players
1649621 and that comes from an attitude of giving rather than taking away so many games seem to be about exploiting the player in one way or another taking away his time and attention
1649622 it seems like hubris to expect that the game will inspire people somehow but deep down i hope it will
1649623 at the very least i want braid to be proof for developers that its possible to make a game thats personal that openly cares about something and that isnt just about having fun
1649624 that its possible to make an art game that actually has good gameplay and its possible to keep the players attention by exploring certain feelings and interactions rather than just throwing lots of new enemies and weapons at them above all if you respect the player as an intelligent person and you treat their time and attention as precious it shows in the resulting game design
1649625 i am extremely pleased with the results achieved to date and am confident that the upcoming complete response will satisfy the remaining fda requirements to gain surfaxin approval we are positioning surfaxin the first peptide containing synthetic surfactant to be the highest quality surfactant replacement therapy available the state of the art advancements made to our manufacturing operations quality systems analytical methods and regulatory capabilities should favorably impact surfaxins acceptance by the medical community and meaningfully support the advancement of discovery labs surfactant based development pipeline
1649626 in july the turnover of prague restaurants stores and travel agencies fell on an average of 30 percent
1649627 at the current price levels we dont offer a corresponding standard if foreign tourists read in any travel guide that theft is high here they will go somewhere else
1649628 this does not give them a reason to come back in the future
1649629 he had a buyer here and i sold a 98 mercedes s320 to this guy thats been shipped to japan thats the internet power
1649630 certain mercedes benzes their sport utility vehicles are in demand in europe

1649656 recycling will be an essential part of daily life for future astronauts whether on board the space station or living on the moon
1649657 delivering this hardware is an important step in achieving the stations full potential allowing for additional crew members and more scientific research
1649658 i have the flight number and date do you want that
1649659 no one told me i needed to print out my return ticket
1649660 no one should have to tell you its common sense
1649661 ive never had to print out a return ticket before
1649662 i just went to belize last week and i didnt need to have my return ticket printed out
1649663 do you have the information on where youll be staying
1649664 yes a hotel in edinburgh i have the confirmation number
1649665 well i didnt know and i dont have a ticket printed so where can we go from here
1649666 theres no where to go i have nothing to show how long youre going to be staying or when youll be leaving
1649667 is there internet service here so i can go online and get what you need
1649668 how else could get you the documentation you want maybe i could go to the american airlines counter and have them print out my return itinerary
1649669 if its my first time traveling in the u k then its not common sense to know what you need here
1649670 sid had to take his cast off last night and im telling you i couldnt even look at his feet
1649671 yo what up this big snoop dogg represent the punjabi aye ya hit em with this

1649677 prettier than all the girls in holland put on top of each other
1649678 provoking extreme pain constituted a form of torture and that in certain cases it could also cause death
1649679 why am i not enraged that my country has killed or hurt so many people for absolutely no noble cause in my name and with my tacit approval
1649680 but cindy it is not polite to be angry or to use such strong language in public
1649681 for them to keep us in the dark and just have us answering a bunch of questions that we cant possibly have a good answer for i dont think its fair to us
1649682 i think there needs to be something said yea or nay for brett favre
1649683 its to the point now man were tired of it here in the locker room just hearing about it
1649684 hopefully they get something done upstairs and they can answer these questions instead of the questions coming to us
1649685 we have an excellent opportunity here to be a very good football team in 2008
1649686 weve had an extraordinary challenge dealing with this situation a lot can be learned from it but they definitely want this thing resolved as soon as possible
1649687 when its in your face like this how do you avoid it how do you not allow it to be in the back of your head you cant
1649688 youre thinking about it everybodys in here thinking about it and we just dont know what the next moves going to be
1649689 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
1649690 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1649691 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1649692 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1649693 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1649694 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1649695 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1649696 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1649697 made the key decisions that will enable us to run aols access and audience businesses separately beginning in 2009

1649700 im pleased by the overall performance of our businesses so far this year particularly in light of the challenging economic environment and that were on track to achieve our business outlook
1649701 this resilience reflects the strength of our brands our expertise and our scale which we think give us a sustained advantage in creating packaging and distributing the industrys most compelling content such as the dark knight sex and the city and the closer
1649702 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1649703 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1649704 we think they wouldnt choose to file but there is a risk they could be overwhelmed by the events
1649705 fixing their product mix and cutting their staff down to manageable levels is going to take a fair amount of time to work down to the bottom line
1649706 if they continue to lose money at the current rate their chances of bankruptcy are uncomfortably high
1649707 gm looks like they have four or five quarters to get their act together
1649708 they may not be running the business well but theyre still selling a lot of cars
1649709 its not buggy whips its a real business i dont think any of them are going away
1649710 it could be a much more robust future than theyve had in quite some time
1649711 the trick is to survive long enough to get to that future thats where the challenge really lies
1649712 the us was not ready to sew up a deal because of a lame duck president who does not have a fast track authority and i therefore expect the wto talks to begin in full earnest in mid 2009 when there is a new us administration
1649713 the flopped geneva meeting has however removed the envelope thus i feel that it did achieve some progress so that the glass is half full and not half empty
1649714 thus it needs much more time as it involves greater depth and many more concessions from rich countries like us and eu and advanced developing countries like india and china
1649715 the collapse of wto talks augurs well for india as it could not afford a deal at the moment because of ensuing elections
1649716 we felt the vote totals reported by yahoo did not reflect all the votes that should have been cast
1649717 we asked broadridge financial to double check the votes transmitted to yahoo on our behalf
1649718 it was just in this one incident with one investor and did not change the outcome of this election
1649719 when we moved out of florida 6 years ago it was 48 a ticket for disney
1649720 provoking extreme pain constituted a form of torture and that in certain cases it could also cause death
1649721 seven years after 9 11 and three years after katrina dhs releases the u s first strategic plan aimed at improving emergency response communications
1649722 skeptics see both john mccain and barack obama as ardent supporters of al jazeeras
1649723 would be the terrorists best friends would water down the patriot act and would make it impossible to fight the war on terrorism
1649724 mccain needs to make voters afraid of obama by hitting him on the two fronts where it would really hurt the economy and huffington posts
1649725 she is well positioned to secure federal support for transit and homeland security projects in the region
1649726 demanding answers from several federal agencies regarding shannon airport for the united states may be scanned for nuclear devices as part of the pre clearance of private aircraft transiting through to america the cork post reports
1649727 if i were a tourist i sure as hell wouldnt want to come here and go through that
1649728 should not grant to those hostile to our values in facing the challenge of jihadist terrorism we need to be able to name and discuss the enemys ideology
1649729 the war on terror is merely the pacific free press
1649730 dont be too alarmed by the apparent high level of support for osama bin laden in the muslim world such support is soft and can be made softer still with the right policies
1649731 we are winning the war on terror in fact weve almost won the war on terror

1649737 waaaaaah poor tony veitch why is everybody so meeeeean waaaaaah
1649738 as recent as three weeks ago people were still reporting that they are getting shocked in baghdad and throughout iraq theres still problems there
1649739 shes the reason weve made so much progress on this but there are still hundreds of questions
1649740 shes an inspiration at least for me because shes determined to find answers not only about her son but to basic questions about the other people who have died
1649741 while logcap performs operations and maintenance on 61 bases in iraq there are also hundreds of smaller joint security stations and combat outposts in iraq
1649742 most of these small outposts are operated and maintained using military assets and have little or no contract support
1649743 this needs high level attention this is not something that should be pushed down
1649744 im sure well spend the night talking with the giants and into today
1649745 this is the third time weve been up here were certainly working as hard as we can to get this done
1649746 all of these rookies obviously as many of the rookies as we can i would have to say that ot og nashan goddard of late he has had a couple pretty good days of practice and im really looking forward to seeing him lt guy whimper people who have had some experience need to play a lot i think when you look at our safety position you want to see a lot of those kids play s nehemiah warrick you want to see him in action continuous advancement of s michael johnson you want to see the running backs which we have some depth i want to take a real good look at kay jay harris and danny ware obviously those young receivers are all going to get a ton of plays
1649747 he has a chance to be a good player he has had a couple of days here of late which have been very good in terms of putting together his assignments and his responsibilities and playing with a little power as well we are trying like heck to see his advancement hopefully it will continue
1649748 theyre both really smart so theyve picked up the defense they can learn in the classroom and then go out and apply it to the field which is really encouraging they both can run and bryan can really run hes a really good athlete which is what we thought when we drafted him even in the padded practices weve had even though we dont technically scrimmage and tackle theyve demonstrated that theyre both going to be physical you know theyll come up and punch blockers and get off blocks and that kind of stuff i think both him and jon are going to be excellent players i really do theyre showing to be good picks
1649749 ifpi was contacted by a member of the label who confirmed you were given
1649750 we hope this matter shows that once we have the correct information we do not want to stop the promotion of music online we fully promote artistic expression as long as we can profit from it
1649751 if wind energy were a sensible economic investment it would not need the lavish federal and state subsidies already in place or the additional largesse sought after by mr pickens
1649752 im still looking for ways to monitize online video more efficiently the quality of the videos is good but these guys have to become businesses

1649754 hes excited about learning and were excited about teaching him
1649755 my senior year of high school coach nick saban came to my school and explained that dj and the other guys would be leaving that kind of stuck in my mind that i would always have a chance to play here

1649803 el primer partido es muy importante porque marca un poco la l nea y grecia ha arrasado en el preol mpico adem s sus pivots tiran desde fuera y eso es una dificultad a adida para la defensa
1649804 dependemos de nosotros pero todos los equipos dependen de s mismos porque estamos a cero los resultados de estados unidos impresionan pero yo remarco que hay que ir poco a poco en lo primero que hay que pensar es el partido contra grecia el objetivo que tenemos es intentar clasificarnos entre los cuatros primeros si lo conseguimos ya hablaremos

1649806 weve made excellent progress on the integration of omx and now expect this transaction to accrete in first quarter of 2009 significantly ahead of schedule driving this acceleration is our confidence in realizing the 100 million expense synergy target by the first anniversary of closing the deal and the integration of our most recent acquisition the philadelphia stock exchange is also well underway and is expected to accrete to our shareholders by the end of 2008 as always we will continue to follow our long standing operating philosophy of leveraging massive scale against the extreme efficiency of our core technology

1649904 in this challenging economic climate the vocalink take home pay index has once again shown strong growth this trend could suggest that workers are pushing for higher pay settlements to combat the increase in the cost of living if this rise in take home pay continues it could lead to weaker economic growth as the bank of england is forced to adopt a tight monetary policy in response
1649905 if the vocalink take home pay index continues to rise and increases to above 5 0 per cent the threat of a return to 1970s style stagflation will intensify however if wages remain stable then the bank of england is likely to stimulate the economy with a series of interest rate cuts in 2009

1649979 i have no problem with roman catholics practising their religion for their own edification and comfort
