9330000 i think we compare the qualifications of both candidates its clear that barack obamas judgment is clearly better suited for the nation
9330001 i dont even know how many people there are in alaska
9330002 the shrine board will now exclusively use the land during the pilgrimage period
9330003 we are suspending the agitation for now as our main demand has been met
9330004 the proprietary status ownership and title of the land shall not undergo any change
9330005 we reject this deal but it is not a major issue for us as we are preoccupied with our freedom struggle
9330006 ive already been criticized by my party for how aggressive our attorney generals office has been
9330007 but i want to give the people of new jersey the greatest possible assurance about that im not done yet youll see in the next few months well do dramatically more
9330008 the parties are both working hard to reach out beyond their stables to offer more descriptive representation on the ticket than weve seen in a long time
9330009 who are the best possible candidates but dont really connect with the average american and this year it seems like theyre going for people who for whatever reason could make that kind of connection
9330010 i dont think were going to go back to 1900 where everybody has to be white and male to run for national office
9330011 the fact that there are all these entry points to a candidate isnt really a solution to the question can i relate enough to that candidate
9330012 what i think youre going to see in this election is a much more accurate reflection of the voting population those who actually go out and vote than perhaps any other time in america
9330013 one way or another were either going to have a president who grew up in hawaii or a vice president who grew up in alaska in the white house how much broader can you get than that

9330015 porque deus n o injusto para se esquecer da vossa obra e do trabalho da caridade que para com o seu nome mostrastes enquanto servistes aos santos e ainda servis

9330018 e jac veio a isaque seu pai a manre a quiriate arba que hebrom onde peregrinaram abra o e isaque

9330030 this does not fit in well with the malay psyche to balance insecurities and fears pas should be appointed to led the pakatan
9330031 firstly parliament is not in session on sept 16 secondly to achieve a secure majority anwar needs more than just 30 mps which means he has to fish a sizeable number of mps
9330032 why should they give it all up for incentives promised by anwar
9330033 a few sabah mps spoke personally with me we had a frank chat and some swore that there is no need to join a coalition led by anwar now
9330034 ibrahim said this move would reflect the actual demographics in the country where malays were dominant in terms of numbers he added that this would appease all communities and lead to the birth of a practical two party system where no single coalition is strong and each side can become the watchdog of the other he said

9330046 israel with the strong backing of the united states refused to recognize the democratically elected hamas government and withheld payment of the millions in taxes collected by the israelis on its behalf this caused great economic hardship and undermined the ability of the government to function but it did not reduce popular support for hamas among palestinians and it reinforced the position of islamic and other extremists who oppose negotiations with israel

9330049 the holocausts mystery wiesel avows is noncommunicable we cannot even talk about it
9330050 he is a multi millionaire but carefully cultivates the image of a perpetually disheveled professor although he has won the nobel peace prize the presidential medal of freedom the guardian of zion medal and the oprah book award many people in israel resent the way he has used the holocaust to make his living some israelis refer to him as a shoan the word shoa is hebrew for holocaust with the suffix it indicates a professional specializing in the subject so it is both funny and derogatory not unlike norman finkelstein referring to wiesel as the resident clown of the holocaust circus
9330051 i support israel period i identify with israel period i never attack never criticize israel when i am not in israel
9330052 its a moral issue in the name of morality how can we not intervene
9330053 we will have to understand that jewish suffering during the holocaust no longer will serve as a protection and we certainly must refrain from using the argument of the holocaust to justify whatever we may do
9330054 in 1915 the turkish government began and ruthlessly carried out the infamous general massacre and deportation of armenians in asia minor

9330059 i have a 100 percent voting record for israel even though there wasnt one synagogue in my congressional district
9330060 there are a lot of guys at the working level up here
9330061 who happen to be jewish who are willing to look at certain issues in terms of their jewishness these are all guys who are in a position to make the decision in these areas for those senators you can get an awful lot done just at the staff level
9330062 aipac is often called on to draft speeches work on legislation advise on tactics perform research collect co sponsors and marshal votes
9330063 command performances before aipac have become standard features in the life of a washington elected official like filing fec reports and hitting on interns the stylized panegyrics delivered at the annual aipac meeting have all the probative value of the dniepropetrovsk soviets birthday greeting to the soviet leader joseph stalin because the actual content is unimportant what is crucial is that the politician in question be seen to be genuflecting before the aipac board in fact to make things easier the speeches are sometimes written by an aipac employee with cosmetic changes inserted by a member of the senators or congressmans own staff
9330064 quietly lobbying congress to approve the use of force in iraq was one of aipacs successes over the past year
9330065 are we going to let the fucking jews run american foreign policy
9330066 it is not the business of other nations to make american foreign policy

9330071 you will not meet anybody nicer than those two women and theyre also very very competitive
9330072 i think christine sort of came up on the scene very quickly and thats the way it happened with me
9330073 i was 16 i was just in high school whereas shes graduated from college she is more mature but i think we both sort of came up on the scene very quickly
9330074 slowly but surely im realizing what has happened to me the past nine weeks it was really a fun experience im sure ill process more of it later its a little bit of a whirlwind right now
9330075 in some ways you know for 24 years time two seconds doesnt seem like that much
9330076 especially when you take into account the new suit which is supposed to be an amazing difference
9330077 its eight tenths of a second off maybe even a full second because it really shapes the body differently
9330078 its almost like an external skeleton it helps the swimmer stay really connected especially when theyre tired
9330079 we just wore regular swimsuits back then and having your whole body covered by a suit to me that would feel strange im used to feeling the water with my skin
9330080 thats what it is it is different to wear i actually put it on pretty early in my warm up and warm up for the fly in the suit because it does give you a different feel to your stroke but im so used to it i dont even notice it any more
9330081 when i was swimming butterfly was very dolphin like you went up and down a lot
9330082 jenna swam as well as anybody the old style butterfly and she made it really fluid and beautiful
9330083 but if she were swimming now she would not come up and down as much
9330084 she would be a lot more forward and i think shes got the perfect body to swim the new fly maybe as well as christine she takes advantage of a really long body and really long limbs and a great kick like she had
9330085 that was what i did i had to get out fast because i wasnt a good finisher i usually like a piano would fall on my back and i would struggle the last few strokes christine doesnt look like she has any trouble with that
9330086 my first 50 i actually try and be as relaxed and try to make it as easy as possible
9330087 i just trust the speed will be there the first half and come off that wall the second 50 i really just try to push and increase the tempo and get after it that last 15 meters thats where i like to make my move

9330215 the russian message was unmistakable the outcome of the war triggered by georgias attack on south ossetia on august 7 is non negotiable and nothing the
9330216 the days when one power was able to bestride the globe like a
9330217 for the rest of us a new assertiveness by russia and other rising powers doesnt just offer some restraint on the unbridled exercise of global imperial power it should also increase the pressure for a revival of a rules based system of international relations in the circumstances that might come to seem quite appealing to whoever is elected us president
9330218 reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to pakistan the united states and the entire world
9330219 many others have been injured and we expect casualties to rise
9330220 those who were left alive were in great suffering i saw a man clutching his leg and crying in pain and asking for help
9330221 zardari thanked pakistan peoples party of which he is the co chairman and said he will announce his decision within the next 24 hours
9330222 presidency is the right of our party and that is why party lawmakers asked zardari to run for this post
9330223 the militants had established their command and control system in the thickly populated areas with an intention to use the civilian population as human shield we are leaving no stone unturned to avoid the civilian casualties in the operation and advance it in a systematic manner we have inflicted considerable damage on their command and control system and according to our information 45 50 hardcore militants including a leading commander have been killed
9330224 we enjoy the support of the people but i still urge them to pick up arms against the militants and dont allow them to hide among them
9330225 these displaced people are in urgent need of basic necessities such as food clean water and shelter
9330226 lack of medical care is a problem for sick people particularly children
9330227 we have credible information about the killing of 10 15 foreign militants out of the 45 killed on saturday
9330228 we have not found the bodies of the foreign militants but intercepts provided us sufficient evidence that they were foreign militants
9330229 we have been forced to take this decision which we take with great regret
9330230 zardari pledged in writing to reinstate the judges within one day of musharraf leaving
9330231 i believe he is the most suitable candidate he is the one who refused to take an oath under musharrafs rule
9330232 this is a great pakistani his service to this country is unmatched
9330233 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
9330234 we are sad over nawaz sharifs decision we want to move together and solve the problems facing the nation
9330235 we will request nawaz sharif to return to the government
9330236 i dont anticipate it would have any impact on our joint efforts to combat extremism
9330237 six policemen and a civilian have been killed the prison bus was on its way to the jail to pick up prisoners for their court hearings
9330238 near the bridge on kurram river an explosive laden vehicle was already parked when the bus approached the vehicle the explosives were detonated by a remote control
9330239 we do see more foreign fighters now though i think coming to pakistan and operating in afghanistan than were seeing in iraq no intelligence agency would say this but it may be that theres been a refocus i think the al qaida knows that they have blown a movement in iraq through a number of missteps over time
9330240 the influence and the presence and the numbers of al qaida in iraq are very much diminished and they had to go somewhere and my guess is my belief is that they probably have gone to that safe haven in the fata
9330241 mr zardaris friends are saying we did not protect her but we are political people three of us were in the car and none of us was looking after her security mr rehman malik now interior minister was the security adviser second in charge was zulfiqar mirza i dont know why these people are being rewarded
9330242 we were with bibi benazir through all the trials and tribulations and we loved our work with her
9330243 party workers are disillusioned and dont know what to do they have no access to him or to people working for him
9330244 most of the people trusted by bibi are not trusted by him benazir had a vision and had the capacity to hold this party together her legacy is not being handled in the way we expected
9330245 insist there is no targeted operation against militants rather it is a haphazard armed invasion on the people of swat
9330246 they have given numerous examples where militants could have been apprehended or attacks on civilians could have been averted had the security forces acted with diligence
9330247 hmmmm smooth sauce y why dont you stick it in the blender you dolt

9330259 dal 2004 stato stabilito un numero di visti per le persone identificate come oggetto di traffico clandestino in australia e questi visti sono destinati alle persone che collaborano con la polizia e la magistratura durante unindagine e un processo penale
9330260 chiaro che il problema riguarda anche persone che lavorano in altri settori
9330261 a differenza della situazione che esiste in nordamerica o in europa per esempio dove i confini sono porosi e molto pi facili da superare
9330262 se riusciamo ad avvertire le persone sulla realt del traffico di esseri umani se riusciamo a spiegare alla comunit nel suo insieme come identificare il traffico di esseri umani allora sar pi facile identificare e proteggere le persone oggetto di questi traffici
9330263 credo che questo tipo di strategie dar un grande contributo alla progressiva eliminazione del traffico di esseri umani in australia
9330264 c bisogno di forte coordinamento tra tutte le persone che lavorano per debellare il traffico di uomini

9330268 as an athlete i think hes got a lot more work to do i think hes got to have a lot more fights and really boost his competition and the quality of the opponents he fights as a person and a personality for the sport hes got a great pr company hes done something that many fighters have taken many years to achieve and havent been able to achieve and hes done it in a very short period of time so if hes able to combine that with his physical strength and learn some more technique and maybe getting some more experience then maybe he would get to a level of popularity that could transcend the sport

9330277 dan janganlah kamu mencampuri mereka itu isteri isteri kamu sedang kamu beritikaf di dalam masjid
9330278 adalah nabi saw sentiasa beritikaf pada 10 hari akhir bulan ramadhan sehingga baginda diwafatkan oleh allah swt kemudian isteri isteri baginda beritikaf selepas kewatan baginda
9330279 tiada keraguan itikaf di masjid adalah satu amalan untuk mendekatkan diri kepada allah swt dilakukan dalam bulan ramadhan adalah lebih afdhal lebih utama dari bulan bulan yang lain ianya disyariatkan di dalam bulan ramadhan dan selain ramadhan
9330280 dan telah bersepakat semua ulama bahawa itikaf itu adalah sunat tidak diwajibkan ke atas orang ramai secara fardhu melainkan seseorang telah mewajibkan ke atas dirinya dengan bernazar maka ia menjadi wajib ke atasnya
9330281 sesiapa telah bernazar untuk taat kepada allah maka hendaklah dia lakukannya dan sesiapa yang bernazar untuk bermaksiat kepada allah maka janganlah dia lakukannya
9330282 wahai rasulullah sesungguhnya aku pernah bernazar ketika jahiliyyah untuk beritikaf satu malam di dalam masjid al haram
9330283 dan janganlah kamu mencampuri mereka itu isteri isteri kamu sedang kamu beritikaf di dalam masjid masjid
9330284 bab pada sepuluh akhir ramadhan dan itikaf itu di masjid masjid semuanya berdasarkan firman allah maksudnya
9330285 dan janganlah kamu mencampuri mereka itu isteri isteri kamu sedang kamu beritikaf di dalam masjid masjid
9330286 itikaf di selain masjid yang tiga iaitu masjid al haram al nabawi dan al aqsa adalah disyariatkan pada waktunya dan tidak dikhususkan kepada masjid yang tiga itu sahaja bahkan boleh dilakukan di masjid yang tiga itu dan masjid yang lain juga inilah pendapat para imam umat islam pemuka mazhab yang diikuti seperti imam ahmad malik al syafie abu hanifah dan selian mereka r
9330287 dan janganlah kamu semua mencampuri mereka itu ister isteri kamu sedang kamu beritikaf di dalam masjid masjid demikianlah larangan larangan allah maka jangan kamu semua menghampirinya demikianlah allah menerangkan ayat ayatnya kepada manusia mudah mudahan mereka bertaqwa
9330288 demikian itulah larangan larangan allah maka jangan kamu semua menghampirinya demikian allah menerangkan ayat ayatnya kepada manusia supaya kamu semua bertaqwa
9330289 sah itikaf pada selain masjid yang tiga melainkan hanya disyaratkan masjid itu didirikan jamaah jika masjid itu tidak didirikan solat jamaah maka tidak sah itikaf di dalamnya kecuali jika seseorang bernazar itikaf di salah satu masjid yang tiga maka wajib dia beritikaf di masjid yang dinazarkan sebagai memenuhi nazarnya
9330290 adalah nabi saw sentiasa beritikaf pada 10 hari akhir bulan ramadhan sehingga baginda diwafatkan oleh allah swt kemudian isteri isteri baginda beritikaf selepas kewatan baginda
9330291 itikaf adalah menetap di dalam masjid untuk melakukan ketaatan kepada allah swt samaada dalam tempoh yang lama atau seketika ini kerana tidak terdapat dalil yang menunjukkan had tertentu sekadar yang kami tahu tiada ketentuan sehari dua hari atau lebih
9330292 bahawasanya nabi saw apabila baginda beritikaf baginda tidak memasuki rumah baginda melainkan untuk keperluan hajat keinsanan
9330293 i didnt think anyone would make it the way i was writing it i thought maybe somebody might like it and make me change it to be network friendly
9330294 mackey murders an internal affairs rat in cold blood he kills a cop shoots him in the head
9330295 and when i read that i thought to myself shawn ryan will never get this ending on the air
9330296 i think one thing that helped me was frankly my ignorance
9330297 i had not done a lot of tv producing at that point i had written for a couple of shows angel nash bridges but i wasnt involved in a lot of production decisions i didnt have any kind of preconceived notions about how these things were supposed to be done
9330298 we didnt want the show to be 85 percent of a network show even though we had 85 percent of the budget
9330299 a lot of other shows have a tendency to try to glamorize the characters
9330300 working on this show they like it if you have circles under your eyes
9330301 it wasnt solely because of the creative success of the shield and fxs nip tuck but a lot of it was the economic success of the shield it inspired people to get into this original series business because we were making the show for a price that made sense
9330302 but thats the nature of tv and film its not the same as copying a test in school
9330303 i cant say i was lying in the weeds waiting to change television i just took the circumstances i was in and did the best i could with them and i think other people in my same position would have found similar ways to do things i do like the fact that we were sort of the first to do it
9330304 he and i had both been on police ride alongs him as research for being an actor on homicide me when i was a writer on nash bridges
9330305 i just said to clark i just want the viewer to feel like theyre on a police ride along and thats what he brought to it
9330306 we were able to make the pilot in such a go for it style that we eventually won the day i think on execution i think our director out directed their director i think we out cast their show they had jason priestly playing a drug addict and that seemed like a casting coup at the time because nobody wanted to put themselves in an fx show
9330307 some roles are exhausting physically some are exhausting mentally some are really devastating psychologically vic is all of that
9330308 you ever take a face cloth and soak it and wring it out thats me at the end of the day im a wrung out washcloth an overcooked noodle
9330309 an inordinate amount of focus is required to do our work on this job and its not just the words its not just the density and the complexities of the story its the traffic its the noises on the street
9330310 really it harkens back to that jack nicholson speech in a few good men
9330311 he is the embodiment of that argument i am the man on the wall you people who sit in your suburban households can look at what i do from a distance and go
9330312 one thing i learned from joss whedon that i blatantly stole was the idea of approaching the stories first from character
9330313 the cop stories were always the last thing wed figure out on a shield episode
9330314 you just start from the premise of what do you want to happen to vic and shane this week what do you want to happen to fellow cops dutch and claudette or danny and julien or vics ex wife corrine what hoops do you want them to jump through and then you figure out what are the best stories that allow you to do that
9330315 i feel like we really finished it in an incredibly strong way
9330316 especially the last seven episodes it becomes like a moving freight train and it becomes quite explosive in the final episodes
9330317 it feels like a movie were waiting for that release
9330318 i am skeptical that were going to see a lot of new viewers
9330319 over time you have a lot of viewers who for whatever reason fall by the wayside
9330320 now that they know its the end they may come back to check it out but im not expecting that ratings this season will be significantly higher than the one that just aired
9330321 in a heartbeat if we had the right part for him
9330322 the guy is to us what johnny carson was to nbc he helped us build this network
9330323 our biggest concern was not is it too far out there
9330324 i had no reason to believe that anyone outside of hbo would make a script like that
9330325 the basic idea of your central character killing another cop at the end of the pilot you didnt see tv shows like that on the major networks
9330326 i had no idea who peter liguori or kevin reilley were
9330327 i had no idea why theyd be interested in my script i spent a lot of time talking to kevin and it became clear that i had stumbled into the zone that they were trying to hit
9330328 i think if we start from a place of hey lets break down barriers the audience can sniff that out and things can seem a little gratuitous
9330329 we just tried to tell the best story we could week to week and we did it without having the usual network filter on how we told those stories or how admirable we had to make our characters the result was something that a lot of people found groundbreaking
9330330 like any great alignment of the stars its hard to imagine now that anybody else could have played it
9330331 but in fact we were struggling casting the role michaels name came up early on his agents wanted us to offer it to him i wasnt going to do it because i knew michael chiklis as a fantastic actor but a very different kind of guy than we had in mind
9330332 it was one of the great moments in my show business career
9330333 when liguori and i walked upstairs to the casting room chiklis was sitting there chewing nicorette gum in a leather jacket with the shaved head
9330334 there was no chit chat there was no small talk he launched right into the scene like vic mackey he was vic mackey he literally knocked us on our asses and then blew out of the door with that same sort of magnetic energy that he brought to the role
9330335 there were other more lucrative options out there and the important thing is that in these fragile careers you have a guy who said this is the right role for the right moment in time for me and im not going to just chase the money
9330336 people were telling me that i was insane and id never work again if i did it
9330337 had the show not worked for whatever reason i would have definitely taken a big hit in terms of taking that kind of risk but thank god i did i had to go with the material and the people involved
9330338 that was my biggest thing am i going to show up on day one on the set and the pink pages are going to come down and this is going to be boiled into its least common denominator because ill quit
9330339 if some great writer wrote something phenomenal tomorrow and it landed on my desk and it happened to be on television id probably damn well do it
9330340 a lot of the greatest stuff thats being made right now happens to be made for the small screen i believe
9330341 in africa we just keep recycling the same old people so change isnt welcome let people who are unique who are young who have ideas let them come up

9330344 obama obama obama he is an american why are you looking at him and not yourself why dont you build your strength here
9330345 i like him because of the things he stands for he stands for hope that anyone can live their dreams if they believe in themselves
9330346 it is a statement that regardless of ones background who your dad or mother is or how you grew up you can do something for yourself
9330347 you cannot sit back and wallow in misery you can always make good of something no matter what circumstances you are facing
9330348 obama is truly a new american note american who stands on all the delicate cutting edges of americas murky politics
9330349 it is unhelpful to own him via silly tribal fundraising projects from africa that in itself is begging for ownership of some kind

9330373 wir hatten im vergleich zu audi einen gewichtsnachteil aber wir haben uns zusammengerissen eine gute leistung gezeigt und in barcelona haben wir jetzt dasselbe gewicht dort k nnen wir timo dann sicher einen spannenden kampf liefern
9330374 hut ab vor timo er hat dem druck heute standgehalten ich war das ganze rennen ber sehr dicht hinter ihm vielleicht h tte es auch anders ausgehen k nnen aber das ergebnis ist nun einmal so und damit m ssen wir zufrieden sein
9330375 es w re nat rlich sch n gewesen vorn zu sein aber das ergebnis ist nun einmal so
9330376 ein paar mal hat er ein bisschen staub aufgewirbelt und als wir auf die drei audi aufgelaufen sind die sich da gegenseitig bek mpft haben habe ich mir auch ein paar sorgen gemacht markus winkelhock hat mich ber hrt als ich an ihm vorbei bin aber der regen h tte auch alles ndern k nnen es hat ein bisschen geregnet wie am n rburgring es waren lange 82 runden hinter dem audi es w re nat rlich sch n gewesen vorn zu sein aber das ergebnis ist nun einmal so
9330377 wir sind das verfolgerfeld deshalb k nnen wir ein bisschen mehr riskieren als timo ich war schon in beiden positionen ich werde versuchen ihn so viel wie m glich unter druck zu setzen es sind durchschnittlich nur drei punkte die ich pro rennen mehr als er holen muss es ist also sehr knapp und ich bin sicher dass sich das vor dem ende der saison noch ein zweimal ndern kann es ist noch lange nicht vorbei und ich bin sicher dass ich und das team bei den n chsten rennen das maximum geben werden

9330812 for a generation certain evangelical teachers have told us that the gifts of the spirit ceased at the death of the apostles or at the completion of the new testament this of course is a doctrine without a syllable of biblical authority back of it the result of this erroneous teaching is that spiritually gifted persons are ominously few among us this frightening hour calls aloud for men with the gift of prophetic insight instead we have men who conduct surveys polls and panel discussions we need men with the gift of knowledge in their place we have men with scholarship nothing more thus we may be preparing ourselves for the tragic hour when god may set us aside as so called evangelicals and raise up another movement to keep new testament christianity alive in the earth the truth of the matter is that the scriptures plainly imply the imperative of possessing the gifts of the spirit but i must also add a word of caution the various spiritual gifts are not equally valuable as paul so carefully explains certain brethren have magnified one gift out of seventeen out of all proportion among these brethren there have been and are many godly souls but the general moral results of this teaching have nevertheless not been good in practice it has resulted in much shameless exhibitionism a tendency to depend upon experiences instead of upon christ and often a lack of ability to distinguish the works of the flesh from the operations of the spirit those who deny that the gifts are for us today and those who insist upon making a hobby of one gift are both wrong and we are all suffering the consequences of their error

9330853 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat

9330912 music is kind of in a strange place right now im not really a listener these days to pop radio although i do listen enough it seems to me that especially in the u s a lot of record companies are really more interested in signing a dance group or a heavy metal band rather than a solo artist there are some exceptions but not many i cant say that there is a problem but music is so unspecific these days a lot of people have mastered doing a pop record where as 20 years ago the great pop records and producers were few and far between although productions are great and a lot of musicians are great today i suppose the only missing ingredient is that truly well composed songs are not commonplace so in that sense i will always go back and listen to paul simons graceland which has a lot of really nice lyric writing and of course stings last work is really good as well i listen to a lot of classical and jazz music

9330936 but after that i expect the media to start focusing on her experience

9330941 it will energize the republican convention but suburban white women arent going to go for her because shes on the wrong side of issues like

9330943 we have got an eating and drinking problem in this country and this movement has to become a dominant philosophy to save us
9330944 i was really impressed about the overall idea of small producers being able to show their ideas and it not being a corporate event
9330945 seriously we flew in from wisconsin for this we need tickets

9330948 it might be a chance for you to tell your story a tiny little farm in the middle of nowhere that has become very successful
9330949 we heard about it and decided to make it part of our vacation
9330950 were hoping that people will come away from this making small changes in their life shopping at farmers markets or joining a community supported agriculture group
9330951 this kind of thinking has been around since the beginning of time
9330952 instead of using spray were using wildflowers at the end of the rows to attract bugs we also release tiny spiders spider mites that eat insects

9330958 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9330959 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9330960 you can have all the pomp and circumstance and greco roman temples that denver will allow but at the end of the day it doesnt mean the american people will believe their lives will get better
9330961 from day one we always knew that our convention would be about issues and their convention would be about barack obama as a celebrity
9330962 everyone recognizes its a game changer john mccain was coming up in the polls before palin and there was energy before this pick but this just shifted it into overdrive
9330963 what karl rove did in 2004 to turn out the social conservative vote was two years in the making theres only 67 days left until the election theres not enough time to do that
9330964 gov palin is very easy to like and she tries to reach out across the aisle on some bipartisan issues
9330965 clearly palin was chosen in hopes of attracting women voters
9330966 there is virtually no other explanation for picking a right wing leader of a state with a population of fewer than 630 000 people which suggests that mccain has such a low opinion of women voters that they would overlook education abortion foreign policy civil rights health care family leave and more simply to vote for a candidate with two x chromosomes
9330967 the democratic convention was four consecutive days of headlines focused on division within the party between clinton and obama
9330968 we know that barack obama failed to unify the democratic party and that has created opportunities for our team
9330969 she is supposed to be this great woman and she seems like she has a lot of hatred toward the country
9330970 theyre pro life and for the death penalty how can that be
9330971 the man sounded very nervous when this officer told him that someone else had said the day before that he was eduardo martinez and that he did not know the minor
9330972 could not focus on anything this officer suggested he simply begged and pleaded with this officer to help him stay in this city so that he could make money for himself and his family the problem is that he never explained just how he was sending money to his mother as he claimed that he did not know her actual address and she has no phone
9330973 did not like the idea of working for minimum wage he seemed to believe that was too little money for his time
9330974 we are dealing with the complex issues created by putative names dates of birth addresses descriptions and whereabouts
9330975 we are obligated to inquire about the presence of existing parents

9331041 anxious denizens of bushworld worry that mccain will beat himself and in the process take down their best chance for deliverance when it comes to the verdict of history one former bush aide who spends his days publicly bashing barack obama sat down for lunch with me recently and before the appetizers even arrived lamented that the democrat will probably crush mccain he ruefully called obama one of the three most talented political figures of his lifetime along with john f kennedy and ronald reagan bushs political guru karl rove in conversations with friends this summer could hardly restrain his exasperation at what he saw as the mccain teams dysfunctional organization and sclerotic message and the president himself privately rails about what he considers mccains undisciplined approach to the campaign and grouses about mccains efforts to distance himself from the administration

9331046 mr mccains advisers said that rallying wavering women would be one of ms palins main jobs in the weeks ahead they said her campaign schedule would take her to areas in swing states like ohio and pennsylvania where there were pockets of women who had supported mrs clinton in the primaries
9331047 in january 2007 palins husband todd invited monegan to the governors office todd palin asked monegan to look into the wooten matter monegan did and later told todd there was nothing he could do because the matter was closed
9331048 monegan told the washington post that palin called him a few days later on his cellphone and that he told her the same thing she brought it up again in february 2007 in the state capitol building and monegan warned her to stay at arms length monegan said palin mostly backed off but kept raising the matter indirectly through e mails in the fall of 2007 monegan said he alerted her to a bad jury verdict against a trooper in rural alaska and she replied by mentioning wooten but not by name in july palins chief of staff told monegan he was being fired because the governor wanted to go in a different direction monegan said
9331049 i think that ultimately she subscribes to the same economic theories and foreign policy theories as john mccain does
9331050 i think you guys can take a look at gov palins record and joe bidens record and make your own judgments in terms of who you think has what it takes to be an outstanding vice president
9331051 i feel confident about my choice ill let john mccain talk about his
9331052 palin was mayor of a town half the size of bexley
9331053 nothing against bexley but i dont know that the mayor of bexleys really quite ready to be in the white house
9331054 sarah palins hometown rallied around her as mayor now republicans wonder if the rest of america will warm up to the surprise pick from cold country though her mother in law has doubts faye palin admitted she enjoys hearing barack obama speak and still hasnt decided which way shell vote im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative well shes a better speaker than mccain
9331055 people will say she hasnt been on the national scene long enough but i believe shes a quick study
9331056 as mayor of wasilla i am proud to welcome all presidential candidates to our city this is true regardless of their party or the latest odds of their winning when presidential candidates visit our community i am always happy to meet them ill even put on their button when handed one as a polite gesture of respect though no reporter interviewed me for the associated press article on the recent visit by a presidential candidate the article may have left your readers with the perception that i am endorsing this candidate as opposed to welcoming his visit to wasilla as mayor i will welcome all the candidates in wasilla

9331120 in a phone conversation friday night walt monegan who was alaskas top cop until palin fired him july 11 told the daily news that the governor also had e mailed him two or three times about her ex brother in law trooper mike wooten though the e mails didnt mention wooten by name monegan claims his refusal to fire wooten was a major reason that palin dismissed him wooten had been suspended for five days previously based largely on complaints that palins family had initiated before palin was governor

9331226 choose from everyday indulgences that take your pasta creation to new heights
9331227 with many fine compassionate and generous people who are so tired overwhelmed and overworked that they have neither the time nor the capacity to listen to the deeper voices that speak to the essence of the problems before them presented with the intricate and delicate issues of poverty public health community well being and crime our impulse born of weariness is to rush headlong toward doing anything that will make the problems go away maybe then we can finally go home and get some rest but
9331228 without the essential nutrients of rest wisdom and delight embedded in the problem solving process itself the solution we patch together is likely to be an obstacle to genuine relief born of desperation it often contains enough fundamental inaccuracy to guarantee an equally perplexing problem will emerge as soon as it is put into place in the soil of a quick fix is the seed of a new problem because our quiet wisdom is unavailable
9331229 can you remain unmoving till the right action arises by itself

9331273 bob never did shut off his computer and my daughter and i sat over there at the hospital the whole time by ourselves
9331274 i told him that he needed to make a choice either his family or his computer he said the computer if you dont like it theres the door we left the house about a week and a half ago
9331275 i dont know what the future holds and i dont want to do it alone
9331276 im not a stupid guy you know theres not much i cant do except stop playing everquest
9331277 as youre sitting here right now would you prefer to be playing everquest
9331278 the reasoning behind that was because our marriage had been so bad for so long and our kids were unhappy i was unhappy and she was unhappy and i knew if the everquest came to an end because i was so addicted to it that it wouldnt be pleasant to be around me for a while so maybe it was best for them to move out while i attempted to do this transition period and work on things and then try to get them back
9331279 does that make sense to you what you just said
9331280 what youre telling me is your wife and three children say i cant take that anymore youre either going to have to give that up or give us up and you say well i would be so unpleasant to be around that yall just need to go on im going to let my children walk out the door over a computer game do you realize were talking about a game here its not even about basketball you dont even get to bounce it its a keyboard game that youre playing
9331281 when youre sitting in the other room with three kids hes in there flirting on the internet with some other gamer
9331282 to play the game everquest if you log on youre going to be on for a minimum of an hour if you get involved with something pretty serious like a raid or into a raiding guild you could be on for five six seven hours in one sitting
9331283 its a game that hes devoting 80 hours a week to right now
9331284 they call it evercrack because you get addicted to it
9331285 when our little boy was 3 years old and hes 11 now
9331286 its taken you nine years to figure out this isnt ok
9331287 what are you waiting on for a child to die for the house to burn down for him to take up with some eagle maiden from the game or something what is it youre waiting on
9331288 i was just hoping that things would change that he would wake up and see the light
9331289 youve got to pull your head out youre going to lose your family youre going to lose your kids
9331290 my kids are 28 and 21 and i look back so thankful that as a young master of the universe i didnt work 20 hours a day like i did when i first got married and that i coached those kids and played games with them i coached basketball for 14 years and i cant hit the ground with the ball but i was there with the boys you know you cant miss that theres no way to get it back theres no way
9331291 how many hours a week do you spend on everquest
9331292 well call it 50 hours a week that you could spend with your kids with your wife in therapy any number of things that would be constructive
9331293 i always ask myself if what im seeing is the problem or is that a symptom of the problem is it a byproduct of the problem when you play this game you dont have to fight you dont have to worry you dont have to contend you dont have to sacrifice you dont have to do any of the things that we call marriage that we call parenting
9331294 its a very low demand situation right you dont have any financial worries you dont have any real life worries with your wife or your kids you can just lose yourself in it its a fantasy its an escape
9331295 so lets say its 18 years from now and shes 20 and says to you bob how come i had to grow up without my daddy what are you going to say
9331296 thats not an answer bob im asking you how come i had to grow up without my daddy what are you going to tell her
9331297 yeah but dad i was so hungry for male attention that the first hairy legged boy that paid me attention and whispered in my ear got me pregnant when i was 14 how does that compare to how youre scoring in your everquest game because you know thats what happens when little girls dont feel love and acceptance and validation and value from their dad they go look for it and they will get it from the first guy whos willing to tell them what they need to hear because you were too busy
9331298 i dont want that to happen thats why im here
9331299 you think because theyre hungry for it its the natural order of things they want acceptance from the other side the other sex
9331300 if those little girls feel like you are the one person in this world who loves them and thinks theyre special and teaches them to value themselves and to love themselves and protect themselves they will walk through this world with their head up high with pride and dignity and when some ol boy comes along and says hey i love you shell say yeah
9331301 you cant head hunt like this what you need to do is back off because if the trooper does make a mistake and it is a terminable offense it can look like political interference
9331302 this is who im supposed to give my vote for the next four years to lead and protect america
9331303 dear democratic women please pretend our vp candidate is hillary clinton just forget that shes pro life and against most things democrats stand for

9331322 atas ku ada hutang puasa ramadhan aku tidak mampu mengqadhanya melainkan dalam bulan syaban disebabkan kesibukan melayani rasulullah saw menghalang ku

9331335 we are constrained to express grave concern over the press statement attributed to undersecretary of health mario villaverde that the department of health will now promote the nationwide use of condoms allegedly as a means to prevent the spread of hiv aids
9331336 it is the duty of the doh never to propose for general public use any prophylactic that could increase the incidence of the disease it is supposed to prevent
9331337 it is therefore irresponsible imprudent and dangerous for the department to declare that the use of the condom without any change in unhealthy sexual behavior will prevent sero positive cases from transmitting hiv aids to their sero negative spouses
9331338 we are inclined to view this as an underhanded way of subverting our strong moral and constitutional objection to the proposed legislation and confronting the nation with a fait accompli bereft of any moral or constitutional basis
9331339 we must encourage men and women to live morally upright lives and to practice marital fidelity and chastity within and outside marriage instead of telling them that risky sexual behavior is acceptable provided they wear a condom to protect them and their partners from hiv aids
9331340 we must encourage men and women to live morally upright lives and to practice marital fidelity and chastity within and outside marriage
9331341 sexuality is ordered to the conjugal love of man and woman in marriage the physical intimacy of the spouses becomes a sign and pledge of spiritual communion
9331342 the creator himself established that in the generative function spouses should experience pleasure and enjoyment of body and spirit therefore the spouses do nothing evil in seeking this pleasure and enjoyment they accept what the creator has intended for them
9331343 sesungguhnya orang orang yang menegaskan keyakinannya dengan berkata tuhan kami ialah allah kemudian mereka tetap teguh di atas jalan yang betul akan turunlah malaikat kepada mereka dari semasa ke semasa dengan memberi ilham janganlah kamu bimbang dari berlakunya kejadian yang tidak baik terhadap kamu dan janganlah kamu berdukacita dan terimalah berita gembira bahawa kamu akan beroleh syurga yang telah dijanjikan kepada kamu

9331373 the imagine lineup is the latest example of what psb does best
9331374 that is to make top of the heap sonics and quality accessible to the widest possible range of potential owners
9331375 it would be almost criminally misleading to dismiss the imagine range as synchrony junior but we freely acknowledge that a good deal of what we learned over synchronys three year development particularly in cabinet design and manufacture empowered the imagine concept and execution and enabled us to complete its development in far less time
9331376 he and the psb design team worked together every step of the way from the earliest napkin sketches to 3d models cad files and actual prototypes to get the organic forms and high end textures we wanted and to make sure they would co exist with the engineering performance parameters

9331383 that little glass dot webcam may not seem of any particular interest but consider again that dot
9331384 the bottom line is were not satisfied weve got a lot of mistakes to correct and we will
9331385 with all the slide protection they eliminated a lot of our pressure
9331386 the big play they hit in the first half we pressured they maxed it and they hit cortez gent in the middle of the field for 33 yards on third and 7 we stayed doubled on him most of the game that was the one play we werent
9331387 we made some adjustments we stayed out of the pressure in the second half because of their protections and because of our double coverage on the x gent
9331388 i was excited about the effort tonight everyone was hustling
9331389 this team has raw talent that needs to be molded everyone needs to keep staying in the film room thats how were going to keep improving
9331390 the first half we were getting a feel for it and getting our feet wet
9331391 the second half we knew what we were being thrown up against
9331392 i gave earl a big hug what impressed me most was how calm earl and blake were back there they were making calls when we shifted defenses they were making the audibles everyones athletic but when youre on top of your assignments like they are the skys the limit
9331393 last year it was 21 3 against arkansas state and instead of stopping them on fourth down we let them make it by six inches
9331394 we practiced hard for these guys weve been hearing this and hearing that about them how theyre the best team in the acc and it didnt phase us
9331395 i would say our team played well for an opening game
9331396 we got whipped about every way you can get whipped
9331397 obviously we were not the ninth rated team in the country we certainly didnt play with the sense of urgency alabama did
9331398 a lot of guys were excited during the week for this game
9331399 for us to come out and play the way we played we dominated the game and came out with a victory yeah a lot of guys are excited
9331400 were winning the battle up front and that is what we have to do
9331401 it opens up everything for us on both sides of the ball
9331402 were winning the battle up front and that is what we have to do
9331403 it opens up everything for us on both sides of the ball
9331404 the way we came out today the way we started the ways we made plays the second half when they got that long kickoff for a touchdown we could have folded but we came back and finished the game i think that says a lot about our guys
9331405 john parker did a fantastic job of making plays when he needed to
9331406 we wanted to come out and take care of the ball
9331407 i came open a lot tonight get me the ball
9331408 we talked in the off season about everybody putting themselves in a position physically to play the game
9331409 we thought the key to the game was not letting them run the ball and running it on offense we shrunk the game and kept them off the field
9331410 skill guys to skill guys in a matchup they have very good skill guys but the key for us was the offensive line and the defensive front
9331411 this is my fourth time playing here at the georgia dome and every game has been exactly like that
9331412 ive liked every one of them because weve won them all
9331413 i cannot remember us getting physically beaten that badly in the last three years
9331414 we created no momentum we did nothing offensively or defensively to do that
9331415 well what we do is me and the coaches will meet together tomorrow and watch the game
9331416 then well look at it with the goalkeeping coach gary pendrey myself and then well look at it and see where we could have done better
9331417 going in at halftime i thought this is good weve got ourselves back into the game there havent been too many threats on our goal and i was happy with some of the stuff we were doing
9331418 then through some decent strikes and some bizarre defending we were onto a defeat that were not proud off
9331419 we were in positions where we could have did something about it but we didnt do anything about it
9331420 we lost 3 0 at ibrox last year and we were far worse than we were today
9331421 it was a good performance from us today and an excellent result
9331422 i dont think we could have imagined that result coming to celtic park
9331423 at the start of the season we havent been scoring freely and we would never have imagined that we would have scored four goals in a place thats very difficult to get a win
9331424 i just felt we tried to change the way we played from last season which we always had the intent to do
9331425 i was wondering if there was going to be a hangover from that we certainly had a little bit of a struggle right at the start of the season but the last couple of games weve settled down a bit and played some decent stuff
9331426 today i felt we played well enough and we managed to get the goals that won us the game
9331427 as often as possible ill play two strikers but well see weve got variations that we can use
9331428 if people look at the games last season we used two upfront in most of the spl games last season but because we had a long european run we played the lone striker
9331429 everyone thought thats what we were but well continue to chop and change
9331430 it used to be that was feature of football clash between a centre forward and a defender but i dont think there was any antagonism between gary caldwell and daniel
9331431 the longer he leaves it the worse its getting its silly now if he wants to come back he should say he wants to come back if he doesnt he should just say that and put an end to it now
9331432 you guys are probably unclear were unclear the manager is probably unclear to what he wants to do if he makes a decision and says what he wants to do it will become a lot clearer for everybody
9331433 the lads rib each other over a lot of things but there was nothing along the lines of him being bullied or anything like that it was blown out of proportion
9331434 on the eve of an important official match real madrid believes that full attention should be focused on the game and this has been totally ignored by the player robinho with the statements he made a few hours before the tie
9331435 the club refers to an earlier statement on this matter when it said if the players final decision was to unilaterally rescind his contract we would have no option but to accept it
9331436 real deeply regrets the way chelseas directors have acted despite knowing perfectly well the decision not to sell the player making statements and even going so far as to sell shirts with the players name on through their official website all this has only blurred the situation and confused public opinion
9331437 there is nothing wrong with publicly confirming our interest in a player when the club involved is well aware of it has been in receipt of two bids and is negotiating to sell the player

9331516 ze woonden zelfs samen maar lindsay was erg bang dat de relatie haar imago in gevaar zou brengen ze bracht daarom steeds mannen mee naar huis tot grote frustratie van courtenay maar de seksuele spanning won altijd en courtenay vergaf haar de uitstapjes ze was in de veronderstelling dat het wel over zou gaan maar toen bleek dat lindsay mannen naar hun huis bleef slepen knapte er iets in courtenay en verbrak ze de relatie toen ze erachter kwam dat lindsay kort na het eindigen van hun relatie een verhouding had met samantha ronson was ze er kapot van ze begrijpt niet waarom lindsay wel in de openbaarheid durft te treden met sam maar dat niet wilde met courtenay elke keer als ze een foto van het stel ziet draait haar maag om
9331517 het evenement was voor ons en alle omwonenden een volslagen verrassing
9331518 een dergelijke party geeft een onacceptabele overlast voor de omwonenden er waren geen vergunningen afgegeven de gemeente kon daarom niet instaan voor de veiligheid en gezondheid van de bezoekers
9331519 i think theyll respond and im optimistic they will because im still optimistic about this team
9331520 i just felt like we wouldnt waste as many opportunities and as many plays as we did this game but we did and now we have to learn from it and go from there
9331521 thatd be the first thing id look for but i dont know because i dont have the film
9331522 i dont think it ever was not a battle but i think it still is we have to look at the protection we have to look at the operation time we have to look at whether the ball got up and look at his steps strength of legs not a problem if he touches it it flies youve just got to make it fly the right way
9331523 i felt like we could have jammed the ball in there a little better
9331524 i thought we could have slammed it in trying to stick the ball across was boneheaded even though he was down i kind of wish i would have got a few more snaps for baron and crawford i think they complement each other pretty well
9331525 its something thats probably going to open our eyes we had entirely too many penalties were not going to sit down and get down on ourselves but we have higher expectations for ourselves
9331526 as a defense were not proud of that at all we take it personal

9331530 nothing is more painful to the human mind than after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events the dead calmness of inaction and certainity which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear

9331532 this made it the coolest august in terms of daytime temperatures since records began at the site in 2000
9331533 in fact on the 18th the temperature struggled to just 17c the coldest august day in three years
9331534 our concern is that while the government has changed the way things operate in many places managers in the public sector are acting as though it is business as usual
9331535 well judge it on the same basis as weve judged the first proposal and that is the public interest
9331536 were concerned mr iemma cant make the case given that hes refusing to bring it to parliament
9331537 if we cant make our minds up over a commercial policy that is so fundamental and basic over eight months how can the business community have any confidence in us
9331538 the fact were still getting vets infected 15 years after the disease was discovered means we are not managing the exposure risk effectively its clear
9331539 it is possible the virus might be shed and infect people before an animal starts to show signs of disease
9331540 should be considered where there is a rapid onset of illness fever and rapid progression to death associated with either respiratory or neurological signs
9331541 it appears that hendra virus has the potential to spread to other horses either through direct contact with infectious body fluids or through indirect contact with contaminated equipment
9331542 if in contact with sick horses shower with soap and shampoo and dress in clean clothes and footwear before handling other horses
9331543 if that is not possible try to temporarily remove your horses during times of peak flying fox activity usually at dusk and during the night
9331544 as the prime minister said in february the government has full confidence in commissioner keelty that position has not changed
9331545 police said they were pursuing inquiries and i dont think its safe to simply assume that those inquiries may only have been specifically in relation tothe united kingdom
9331546 look at what the afp said at the time the amount of email information and communications they were looking at ive forgotten the precise quantum but we were talking emails that ran to something like the equivalent of 30 000 pages that had to be read
9331547 the afp is a thoroughly professional organisation that doesnt mean to say mistakes arent made from time to time inquiries dont always lead to prosecutions or convictions and the timing of them really can depend on a whole range of things
9331548 our people have been hurt by these threats the company has attempted to intimidate us
9331549 now what we want to do is get around to negotiating properly with a company that is treating us respectfully and notholding a big stick over our heads
9331550 this morning i was supposed to be in brisbane but i am still in thailand
9331551 it was a beautiful holiday but now it has become a nightmare
9331552 i dont have any money i tried to pay for the hotel on my credit card but there was not enough money on it
9331553 i am trying to call my travel insurance but its difficult and the airport is still closed so i dont know when we can go home
9331554 all we can say is that at the height of the season there can be as many as 20 000 australians in phuket at one time
9331555 they have to drop you 20 minutes away from the airport so you have to walk with your luggage and then wait to find out if the planes are going
9331556 if you didnt know youd just think it was normal except for a few people talking on the street about it
9331557 im not fussed if they dont fly for another 48 hours id rather be stuck here than in bangkok
9331558 it hasnt been real good ive got one friend who came the other day who had to jump the fence to get out of the airport because all the people were barricading the gates
9331559 another mate cant get out hes due back at work but he cant get a flight
9331560 corte a carne mas n o pode levar o sangue
9331561 oh before we started going out i slept with judith

9331576 and he gave the apostles the prophets the evangelists the pastors and teachers to equip the saints for the work of the ministry for the building up of the body in christ until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to mature manhood to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ so that we may no longer be children tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine by human cunning by craftiness in deceitful schemes rather speaking the truth in love we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head into christ

9331584 bewildering unnerving surreal and darkly comic film from a visionary filmmaker
9331585 the struggles of a young man who faces villains and demons on multiple planes
9331586 bears about as much resemblance to the typical sundance validated indie film as a komodo dragon does to that cute insurance company gecko
9331587 the weinstein company and genius products uner the dimension extreme label
9331588 after i show the film i have a q and a session with the audience this has become an extremely important part of the show particularly after showing
9331589 the film started production as a short film in 1996
9331590 there have been smaller distribution companies interested in distributing the films
9331591 i will come back at a later date and show part two of the trilogy which premiered in sundance in 2007 it is fine everything is fine it is important to show what is it first because it sets up thinking about taboo subject matter to that when people view it is fine everything is fine the taboo element is not what becomes important but the emotional content of the film the two films have thematic similaries but are very different kinds of films it is fine everything is fine note the period is part of the title very much deals with the emotional catharsis of the main character who is played by the author of the screenplay steven c stewart who was born with a severe case of cerebral palsy steven had written his screenplay in the late 1970s i read it in 1986 and as soon as i had read it i knew i had to produce the film steve had been locked in a nursing home for about 10 years when his mother died because of his palsy he was very difficult to understand people that were caring for him in the nursing home would derisively call him m r for mental retard this is not a nice thing to say to anyone but steve was of normal intelligence when he did get out he wrote his screenplay although it is written in the genre of a murder detective thriller truths of his own existence come through much more clearly than if he had written it as a standard autobiography i am very proud of the film as i am of what is it i feel it is fine everything is fine will probably be the best film i will have anything to do with in my entire career part three will not be shot for quite some time and it will not be the next film that i shoot
9331592 usually a successful actor is associated with a particular thought or perception in the peoples minds
9331593 not only is my father bruce glover an actor but my other retired as an actress and primarily as a dancer when i was born she is also in
9331594 i would say that my personality type is not that of a standard actors personality type which would more be someone who enjoys attention for attentions sake
9331595 as far as the performance question goes there are very different ways to think about this
9331596 there are lots of others as well and there are some that i have not even seen that i feel like i would like i usually like my own performances but i usually do not watch them more than once there are exceptions though
9331597 i liked spending time in memphis very much it was a great experience to work with milos forman interestingly i had already begun shooting what is it before i was in memphis then shot the people vs larry flynt and then completed shooting what is it also my father acted in the walking tall films shot in memphis in the 1970s bruce glover played grady coker opposite first joe don baker and then bo svenson in the buford pusser films which were shot all over tennessee i am looking forward to coming back and showing what is it after all this time

9331603 how resilient are mortgage backed securities to collateralized debt obligations
9331604 one year ago the bush administration proactively provided an affordable safety net to homeowners who wanted to stay in their homes
9331605 today with the expansion firmly in place hundreds of thousands of families are in a better place thanks to fha federal housing administration
9331606 the deal is that true fhasecure delinquent loan refinance activity has been so low that hud decided to call all of its refinance business fhasecure
9331607 in theory the program could be expanded to accommodate more delinquent borrowers without loosening underwriting or taking on any more risk but hud and the bush administration has been reluctant to do so
9331608 fhasecure was a pr driven program created to show that the bush administration wasnt ignoring the mortgage crisis
9331609 were trying to make the point to families were there for you with any new program the word has to get out
9331610 how far do you open the door and how many borrowers are beyond rescue you have to draw a line and say youll insure some borrowers on one side of the line and not others its really a policy discussion thats beyond me to opine on
9331611 la times the regulators operating failed indymac bank said wednesday that they would try to modify about 25 000 troubled mortgages by slashing interest rates to as low as 3 for five years extending payments over 40 years and in some cases charging interest on only part of the loan balance the plan aimed at about 37 of indymacs seriously delinquent borrowers is the start of a modification program that eventually could involve thousands of other borrowers at the savings and loan sheila bair chairwoman of the federal deposit insurance corp said she hoped it would become a model for the reeling mortgage industry
9331612 first we eased monetary policy substantially particularly after indications of economic weakness proliferated around the turn of the year in easing rapidly and proactively we sought to offset at least in part the tightening of credit conditions associated with the crisis and thus to mitigate the effects on the broader economy
9331613 the second element of our response has been to offer liquidity support to the financial markets through a variety of collateralized lending programs i have discussed these lending facilities and their rationale in some detail on other occasions briefly these programs are intended to mitigate what have been at times very severe strains in short term funding markets and by providing an additional source of financing to allow banks and other financial institutions to deleverage in a more orderly manner
9331614 the third element of our strategy encompasses a range of activities and initiatives undertaken in our role as financial regulator and supervisor some of which i will describe in more detail later in my remarks briefly these activities include cooperating with other regulators to monitor the health of individual financial institutions working with the private sector to reduce risks in some key markets developing new regulations including new rules to govern mortgage and credit card lending taking an active part in domestic and international efforts to draw out the lessons of the recent experience and applying those lessons in our supervisory practices
9331615 la times despite angry protests from students that led to 16 arrests at ucla californias two public universities took actions wednesday to charge higher fees for education in the fall the trustees of the cal state university system voted to raise annual undergraduate student fees 10 or 276 a key committee of the university of california regents approved a 7 4 or 490 raise per year for undergraduates that is expected to be endorsed by the full board of regents today

9331622 we dont believe that brigham young ever signed his name to such a document
9331623 we believe it all an imposition but if mr arago m d will prove to the contrary we will contradict this assertion
9331624 this really is d day i fully expect the driving standards agency officers to come to this meeting having massaged their statistics intending to brush us off driving instructors and their students from wyre forest and further a field will not be bullied in to submission by the dsa like this i rally all students parents relatives and anyone else who feels that this is wrong to attend this meeting we need to show the dsa the human affect their decision will have our students deserve a fair start in life and our local businesses deserve the chance to make an honest living closing kidderminsters driving test centre is going to hinder both
9331625 under the sign of virgo they have fine intellects and a keen attention to detail everyone knows the stereotype of virgos as neat freaks but as my former astrology teacher eileen mccabe taught me they can also be total slobs why they just give up and surrender to chaos if they cant achieve perfection

9331631 is this truly what it means to be a chosen nation
9331632 this reinforces the idea that treating patients with heart failure takes more than just drugs
9331633 with a lot of these patients you have no other choice
9331634 theyve tried other treatments and are at the end of the road
9331635 its a small benefit but we should always be emphasizing to patients what they can do in terms of diet that might help
9331636 this study changes the certainty of the evidence we have about fish oils

9331642 we are fighting this war this is our war there is no question of americas dictation
9331643 the operation in swat is in high gear but the holy months sanctity requires that people spend it in peace and harmony
9331644 the parties are both working hard to reach out beyond their stables to offer more descriptive representation on the ticket than weve seen in a long time
9331645 who are the best possible candidates but dont really connect with the average american and this year it seems like theyre going for people who for whatever reason could make that kind of connection
9331646 i dont think were going to go back to 1900 where everybody has to be white and male to run for national office
9331647 the fact that there are all these entry points to a candidate isnt really a solution to the question can i relate enough to that candidate
9331648 what i think youre going to see in this election is a much more accurate reflection of the voting population those who actually go out and vote than perhaps any other time in america
9331649 one way or another were either going to have a president who grew up in hawaii or a vice president who grew up in alaska in the white house how much broader can you get than that

9331654 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9331655 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9331656 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9331657 because shes a reformer and she thinks outside the box the way my husband does
9331658 you know washington is just a quagmire its a mess right now and both of them have been serious reformers
9331659 no no no i completely disagree and i know my husband does too she is heavily experienced in what she has done

9331666 this head coaching thing is just a title were all doing the same things we did before its not broke and im not going to try and fix it
9331667 youre playing on your home field and in front of these fans the greatest fans in the world and the way our defense played and the way our offense came out and played
9331668 we wanted to get a good w on the board for tschimperle right away because we knew there was a lot of pressure on him
9331669 i feel the same as i did when i was the head coach
9331670 and i dont like that feeling im still as nervous and edgy as ever i guess that feelings ingrained
9331671 doses a screamer and a yeller tschimp seems to get right to the point and he knows what hes talking about so does dose but hes a little feistier

9331687 ive just learned to listen to whats important to me here let me show you
9331688 let me put it to you this way each of those events demands people expectations each exposes a window into your inner world revealing areas that need healing and restoration you still believe the lie that experiencing life and being in relationship with me is about your performance even the person who wrongs you or the one who places an unjust burden on you or the one who makes you feel in their debt any of these are a gift to you if for no other reason than they expose what you work so hard to hide
9331689 she is like an idol everyone is waving to her
9331690 theres nobody in for him so hes staying here and well continue to use our strikers
9331691 it used to be a feature of play in the game a battle between the centre forward and centre half
9331692 yes they were fouls but there was no malice between daniel and gary caldwell
9331693 it was two players committed to winning the ball its a shame it ends up with a decision like that
9331694 three things are such which if found in somebody he will taste the sweetness of iman viz allah and his messenger salalahu alayhi wa salam are dearest to him he loves anybody for the sake of allah and he hates anybody for the sake of allah and abu dawood and tirmizi narrated that to love for allah and to hate for allah is from iman
9331695 o ye who believe raise not your voices above the voice of the prophet salalahu alayhi wa salam nor speak aloud to him in talk
9331696 and allah taala sends blessing on the prophet o ye that believe send ye blessings on him and salute him with respect
9331697 whatever allahs messenger gives you take that and whatever he forbids you leave that
9331698 never can any of you attain perfect iman until your passions become obedient to my order
9331699 janganlah kamu menyangka bahwa aku datang untuk meniadakan hukum taurat atau kitab para nabi aku datang bukan untuk meniadakannya melainkan untuk menggenapinya
9331700 sebab apa yang tidak mungkin dilakukan hukum taurat karena tidak berdaya oleh daging
9331701 kamu tahu bahwa tidak seorang pun yang dibenarkan oleh karena melakukan hukum taurat tetapi hanya oleh karena iman dalam kristus yesus
9331702 dan kitab suci yang sebelumnya mengetahui bahwa allah membenarkan orang orang bukan yahudi oleh karena iman telah terlebih dahulu memberitakan injil kepada abraham
9331703 i thought and was told it would cost the sport support and financial backing but people have come to the conclusion that whatever happened with max was max and it has nothing to do with anything else
9331704 i dont think they care any more people forget all these things at the time it was a shock if it had happened to other people it probably wouldnt have been a shock
9331705 for a short period i said he should resign because i had so much pressure from people to say he should resign in a lot of ways at the time i wished he had done now i dont see why he should
9331706 in terms of benefiting the team casey would be my first choice because of the four contenders i think hes the best player
9331707 he can be erratic but he hits the ball a country mile and hes a birdie machine he would get points for the team
9331708 id also go for darren because his selection would underline exactly what the wildcard system is designed for
9331709 he is a player who was out of from at the start of the year and did not do enough to qualifying but who had hit form at just the right time
9331710 us naval ships not going to poti amp saakashvilli is finished
9331711 clemson is the best team that the acc has to offer
9331712 if you can get guys like charles you need someone to back him up
9331713 i would love the job theres no question about that but you have to weigh up your life
9331714 i was thinking i could do it and i would love the job but its a question if i want it or not
9331715 i have been running for three weeks and im hoping to be playing at the end of october
9331716 if things keep going as well as they have been thats where i will be if it goes well it could be sooner
9331717 the english said that serie a is retirement ground do you want to know what i think i thought the italians would give me an answer
9331718 however if you want me to wave the italian flag i will i am with italy on this one
9331719 michael will put pen to paper over the next 24 hours
9331720 i want him to stay ive always said so and i stand by what i say he is important for us
9331721 you need to know in what condition a player will arrive and theres been a lot of pressure on him and he isnt in the optimum condition to play hes got too many concerns going on in his head
9331722 we realised this during the spanish supercopa we wanted to win the title so we decided it was better to use players who at that time were more focused
9331723 were playing in the premier league now were playing against good players and theyll move the ball around easily against 10 men
9331724 our lads kept working and i thought they were smashing
9331725 its been a very long week and i think a lot of misspent energy has been taken up by press the media players everybody
9331726 mallorca started better but i think that the first goal was crucial for us
9331727 we improved in the second half and we were superior to our rivals we played much better and we deserved the win
9331728 its not as if we are asking for any money for smertin
9331729 there is a dialogue between the two owners on a regular basis and they have been supportive throughout the last six months especially in the transfer market
9331730 if i get selected itll be fantastic if i dont i wish the team every success
9331731 the more time goes on the less likely it is ill be able to complete the move but never say never in football
9331732 if there was a chance then obviously id love to come to roma it is a lifelong dream as i am a roma fan from the city
9331733 id have no problem coming there to be fourth choice seeing as at torino there are already four forwards for three places
9331734 he was playing awesome hitting the ball so hard and flat
9331735 it was so tough for me to get a rhythm but i felt after the third set the momentum was with me
9331736 my fitness is something ive worked so hard on ideally youd rather not play matches of that length but sometimes it happens youve got to get through it
9331737 the chairman dave whelan spoke to me recently about my future and he said that until i came up to him and told him i wanted to go then he wouldnt entertain any bids
9331738 we are trying to buy new players but the problem is always first of all the availability and also the fact that its finding players who are better or at least as good as the ones we already have
9331739 i saw nasri slice down joey and thats what i was so upset about
9331740 if it had been the other way round im sure joey would have been sent off joey came on and got a very good tackle in on nasri then he tripped joey when he was running back
9331741 i like nasri and we talked about bringing him to newcastle but he cant do that
9331742 we could have won tonight but coming away from marassi with three points is never easy
9331743 we did well for an hour and then samp began to come out and they put us in difficulty
9331744 its only the first game and so ill take this point without any major dramas
9331745 its special for daniel he has been fantastic since he arrived and he will be remembered long after he has gone
9331746 hell be out for probably ten days to two weeks its the same injury that he got in pre season against wolves
9331747 someone came down on the bottom of his left achilles
9331748 the situation has not changed i want to leave real and play for chelsea i am only thinking of chelsea and want to play there
9331749 since may i have been trying to renew my contract but they didnt want to know because they were so sure of signing cristiano ronaldo now they havent signed anyone they dont want me to go
9331750 real president ramon calderon had said that if a good offer came they would let me go chelsea have made a great effort and i dont know what more i can do
9331751 i have told the president the sports director and the coach i want to go i wont refuse to play for real if i stay but if schuster wants to keep a player who is unhappy it is his responsibility
9331752 i want him to stay ive always said so and i stand by what i say he is important for us
9331753 you need to know in what condition a player will arrive and theres been a lot of pressure on him and he isnt in the optimum condition to play hes got too many concerns going on in his head
9331754 i am feeling fine i am feeling really good and my recovery is going well
9331755 i am more than happy with my progress and i hope to be back playing for united by the end of september that is my target and it is a realistic one
9331756 i want him to stay ive always said so and i stand by what i say he is important for us
9331757 you need to know in what condition a player will arrive and theres been a lot of pressure on him and he isnt in the optimum condition to play hes got too many concerns going on in his head

9331909 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9331910 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9331911 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9331912 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9331913 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9331914 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9331915 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9331916 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9331917 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9331918 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9331919 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9331920 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9331921 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9331922 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9331925 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9331926 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale

9331941 in queste ultime settimane ha detto ratzinger al termine della recita dell angelus dal palazzo apostolico di castel gandolfo la cronaca ha registrato laumento degli episodi di immigrazione irregolare dallafrica
9331942 non di rado la traversata del mediterraneo verso il continente europeo visto come un approdo di speranza per sfuggire a situazioni avverse e spesso insostenibili si trasforma in tragedia quella avvenuta qualche giorno ha aggiunto il papa ricordando i recenti casi di sbarco di clandestini che hanno prodotto numerosi morti fa sembra aver superato le precedenti per lalto numero di vittime la migrazione fenomeno presente fin dagli albori della storia dellumanit che da sempre pertanto ha caratterizzato le relazioni tra popoli e nazioni
9331943 lemergenza in cui si trasformata nei nostri tempi tuttavia ci interpella e mentre sollecita la nostra solidariet impone nello stesso tempo efficaci risposte politiche so che molte istanze regionali nazionali e internazionali si stanno occupando della questione della migrazione irregolare ad esse va il mio plauso e il mio incoraggiamento affinch continuino la loro meritevole azione con senso di responsabilit e spirito umanitario
9331944 senso di responsabilit devono mostrare anche i paesi di origine non solo perch si tratta di loro concittadini ha aggiunto benedetto xvi ma anche per rimuovere le cause di migrazione irregolare come pure per stroncare alle radici tutte le forme di criminalit ad essa collegate dal canto loro i paesi europei e comunque quelli meta di immigrazione sono tra laltro chiamati a sviluppare di comune accordo iniziative e strutture sempre pi adeguate alle necessit dei migranti irregolari questi ultimi poi vanno pure sensibilizzati sul valore della propria vita che rappresenta un bene unico sempre prezioso da tutelare di fronte ai gravissimi rischi a cui si espongono nella ricerca di un miglioramento delle loro condizioni e sul dovere della legalit che si impone a tutti
9331945 come padre comune sento il profondo dovere di richiamare lattenzione di tutti sul problema e di chiedere la generosa collaborazione di singoli e di istituzioni per affrontarlo e trovare vie di soluzione il signore ha concluso benedetto xvi ci accompagni e renda fecondi i nostri sforzi

9331951 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9331952 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono

9332351 enel distribuzione modifichi le proprie procedure di attivazione e subentro nella fornitura di energia elettrica non subordinando lattivazione e il subentro nella fornitura di energia elettrica al previo pagamento di morosit pregresse non attribuibili al nuovo cliente che li richiede
9332352 consistente scrive lantitrust nella richiesta di subordinare lattivazione di una nuova fornitura di energia elettrica al pagamento di morosit pregresse di un precedente contraente in relazione alla medesima utenza domestica in particolare il denunciante locatario di un appartamento lamentava il preteso versamento di una determinata somma a titolo di morosit di un precedente inquilino
9332353 non esiste alcun titolo che legittimi gli esercenti a condizionare lattivazione da parte di un nuovo utente di un contratto di somministrazione di energia o gas al pagamento di morosit pregresse di precedenti utenze costituisce una pratica diffusa del settore la richiesta di una dichiarazione di estraneit del nuovo cliente rispetto al precedente titolare del contratto in particolare nelle situazioni in cui lutenza morosa risulti ancora allacciata
9332354 viene considerata sufficiente ai fini dellattivazione della fornitura senza che ci comporti il pagamento di debiti pregressi
9332355 si senza il pagamento il computer non mi consente di avviare la procedura per il nuovo allaccio
9332356 dalle informazioni raccolte dagli uffici afferma dunque lautorit sembra risultare che il comportamento oggetto di segnalazione non rivesta carattere episodico attribuibile ad errori materiali degli operatori del servizio clienti di enel distribuzione addetti al contatto con i clienti finali costituendo piuttosto una politica aziendale volta a richiedere sistematicamente il pagamento di morosit pregresse da parte di nuovi utenti che richiedano lattivazione del servizio
9332357 subordinerebbe sistematicamente laccesso al servizio pubblico di distribuzione e vendita dellenergia elettrica dalla stessa gestito in regime di monopolio legale al pagamento da parte dei clienti richiedenti lallacciamento di corrispettivi economici che non trovano alcuna giustificazione nel servizio offerto il pagamento da parte dei nuovi utenti del servizio di morosit attribuibili a clienti precedenti non dovrebbe infatti per stessa ammissione di enel intervenire quando il soggetto richiedente diverso dallutente che si reso precedentemente inadempiente e non versa in situazioni di morosit nei confronti di enel distribuzione
9332358 tale comportamento possa costituire un abuso di posizione dominante da parte di enel distribuzione
9332359 sfruttando la propria posizione dominante avrebbe posto in essere una condotta nei confronti dei consumatori finali idonea ad integrare una fattispecie di abuso di posizione dominante ai sensi dellarticolo 3 della legge n 287 90 in base a tale disposizione infatti sono suscettibili di essere qualificati come abuso di posizione dominante quelle condotte che si traducono in un aggravio economico ingiustificato ed arbitrario per gli utenti finali

9332395 any sanctions would hurt the european union first of all much more than russia
9332396 russia is not has no intention to continue this confrontation
9332397 but if our partners would prefer to chose another option of course russia will reply will react
9332398 russia wants to be an equal partner but the partnership should not be the kind of partnership between the horseman and horse but of two equal individuals
9332399 so far we have seen no practical steps that would bear evidence to a cooling off i hope this wont happen because no matter what whatever is being said the truth is on our side
9332400 the situation is very difficult and we must be firm on our position in offering a line defending of course territorial integrity of georgia
9332401 when russia has a grievance over an issue such as south ossetia it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force
9332402 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9332403 the dangerous spiral of violence over georgia must be stopped
9332404 we need a strong and sensible european role to allow a return to reason and responsibility
9332405 someone should first tell me what a sanction against russia could be
9332406 particularly in such a serious political situation it is necessary to show a bit of common sense

9332425 he is fully committed to throwing all federal assets into this fight
9332426 that strikes me as exceptionally foolish people should heed the instructions to evacuate and protect their own lives
9332427 every area where the storm passed is reporting damage to homes and public buildings
9332428 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9332429 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9332430 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9332431 to me at my age being a witness to such a historical moment was overwhelming
9332432 it was not just a historical moment for our family but for the country hes a man of integrity and everything america needs as a president he engulfs it all what better person to unite and bring america to what it needs to be
9332433 my oldest son was only in a stroller when that happened but it was such a great thing for ohio
9332434 i hope obama makes another stop in ohio before his campaign is over
9332435 its not his race i look at its his ideas
9332436 those transcend his race as an educator one of my concerns is that our charter schools are just killing public education right now and i think he needs to hear what we as educators have to say its important for obama to visit ohio because of the economic status were in weve lost a lot of major companies and businesses
9332437 he covered all the points i mean he just went right down the line he let john mccain know he would definitely debate him but not on personality just on the issues and thats what it should be i just thought he was great
9332438 its been 143 years since the civil war and now the lord has raised up this man to be our presidential candidate
9332439 i believe he raised up martin luther king and now hes raised up obama
9332440 were midway between cleveland and columbus and weve got good voters here
9332441 ive been saying that for the last year and a half i think he should be here for two reasons hillary clinton embraced us in the primary and thats probably why she won ohio also mall towns usually turn out more voters
9332442 we have a lot of the same ideas so ive always been all for him
9332443 i think this upcoming election will encourage more minorities to get out and vote
9332444 im glad hes here because i think he has a lot of work to do in ohio
9332445 there is a lot of racism in this state and in mansfield
9332446 ive been active in civil rights for over 40 years and i know were still dealing with this im hopeful that he wins i think hes more in command than mccain this should be a no brainer for the american people
9332447 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9332448 we are monitoring the storm and are moving forward with our scheduled program at this time
9332449 we understand that some participants may need to remain home to prepare their states for the approaching storm while we intend to gavel our convention to order on monday afternoon our convention places country first and ensuring the safety of our citizens is of paramount importance
9332450 you have to give a lot of credit to last years national champions
9332451 to hold usc for beyond a half is a big testament to our team and what were doing defensively right now
9332452 well address the things we need to improve on well address some individual and team errors but i think this is a great improvement from what this programs done in the past against ranked opponents so were going to keep heading in that direction
9332453 on the forecast track gustav should make landfall on the northern gulf coast on monday

9332457 im afraid that we may have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it
9332458 but you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too

9332467 april to june was always going to be the pain period for the consumer with rising rates and petrol prices but no tax cut relief
9332468 these trends in credit growth have not been seen since the recession of the early 1990s
9332469 when i asked why he did it all he answered youd better ask mum
9332470 it really was clear from the boys wordsthat his life was being imposed on him rather than him having any real choice
9332471 its motivated by parents thinking a child engaging in lots of activity and the parent being involved in taking them to and fro is a sign of good parenting that theyre somehow providing their child with an advantage that will benefit them in later life
9332472 sometimes these childrens lives become so crowded they end up with no time to just veg out to fiddle with lego or toys to give their minds and bodies a rest to do what they want to do to not be on or perform all the time
9332473 and where is that time to just sit and hang out with your kids rather than be doing things with them all the time
9332474 children have gone from background to foreground in domestic life with more attention centred on them their upbringing and their small accomplishments
9332475 i know of little children who do not have a night off every night after school they are attending structured expensive goal based activities and classes
9332476 i cannot take my own children around to play with them because they are always busy sometimes with two classes on the one night
9332477 after living in fiji for two years i really noticed this phenomenon when i returned to melbourne
9332478 there is simply too much emphasis on doing and not enough on children being
9332479 i make sure we have space in our lives to hang around at home or to go to the park if the sun starts shining
9332480 they should be told to go outside and play or pull out a drawer and find old things to play with anew or just to enjoy reading or thinking to themselves for achange
9332481 kids today are not given enough contemplative imaginative free time partly because of the lack of open outdoor space but also because parents think they have to manage their kids time terrified their little darlings might become bored
9332482 its a way of reassuring ourselves that our children are going to be insulated from pain and adversity
9332483 we tell children they are wonderful for tying their shoelaces or getting 50 per cent in an exam but really its our way of flattering ourselves that were far more sensitive to children than people were in the past
9332484 dweck finds that kids who are always told how smart they are who are praised for every little thing fail to try they dont put in the effort needed to learn new things because they think they should be able to do it automatically because they are smart
9332485 instead she shows that kids praised for their actual effort are more likely to succeed than the smart kid always being told how good they are
9332486 individual mastery and effort should be the goals of education not just test results to satisfy some sort of school league table
9332487 on the one hand were rushing and hurrying children far too much and expecting more than we should of them on the other hand many parents with the best of intention are becoming more and more afraid of being the parent and more wanting to be a peer or a friend
9332488 there is a myth out there in parentland that the more your kids do the better and more successful they will be as adults in fact it may just be the opposite is the case with kids doing too much and ending up not being able to play to their strengths
9332489 kids have been exploited as little consumers they have power in the marketplace and parents have been duped into thinking that indulgence is the way togo
9332490 and work demands mean spare time with the kids is hard to get so there is a lot of compensation going on
9332491 we have to be careful about telling kids how fantastic they are for setting the table and giving them gold stars for making their beds or bringing their dirty plate from the table to the kitchen sink what we should be saying in those circumstances is simply thank you because its something they should be doing without false praise
9332492 for instance ive seen parents having to negotiate with siblings to give them something special on their brother or sisters birthday so they dont feel left out there are times when children have to learn how to deal with the fact they arent the ones in the spotlight that day its part of growing up
9332493 there is a concern that if we are always praising children and giving them what they want they arent learning how to regulate their behaviour in the face of adversity they arent learning how to cope with disappointment they arent learning how to cope with conflict
9332494 they need to be authoritative set limits and give firm guidelines if genuine self development is to result
9332495 mum and dad as servant is not the model todays kids need they need emotional and moral guidance a sense of respect for others and room to become capable responsible citizens in their own right
9332496 just because you dont have something doesnt mean you arent capable of getting it in the most simple of ways
9332497 he said to his mother i have killed my truck because it is tired of being sad
9332498 i remember one time a person was harming himself up a tree and his children were crying under the tree
9332499 his wife was crying and yelling under the tree his blood was dripping from the tree
9332500 there is no reason why anybody would overdose on shampoo unless they had learnt that behaviour in detention centres
9332501 we think there are still a lot of unanswered questions about how the system operated and continues to operate
9332502 a royal commission would be able to establish how much really has changed and whether there is true accountability now in the system
9332503 you didnt put rat poison in my drink did you
9332504 il dato fa cadere le braccia il 45 delle 31 persone controllate durante la notte nel veronese risultato positivo ai controlli anti alcol e droga insomma quasi un guidatore su due non viaggiava in condizioni di sicurezza mettendo a repentaglio la propria vita e quella degli altri dai controlli effettuati nel centro del dipartimento delle dipendenze di verona e in quello mobile di peschiera del garda risulta inoltre che il 70 dei positivi aveva assunto alcol prima di mettersi alla guida e un 30 droga o sostanze stupefacenti e alcol insieme
9332505 ho bevuto solo una birra e un limoncello a cena con mia moglie in un ristorante ed ora mi ritrovo qui
9332506 i primi risultati dei controlli sono in linea con il trend riscontrato lanno precedente nel veronese quando un 47 5 delle persone fermate risult positivo
9332507 i am a fan of chiranjeevi when a great personality like him forms a political party with a noble objective i dont want to cause any inconvenience to him i made a representation to the election commission withdrawing my application
9332508 a draw for me is a normal result because we had more chances but made mistakes in the final shot
9332509 i think we need to respect tottenham and the quality they have i dont think anyone in this room thinks that tottenham are nothing they put eight or nine players at the back and it is difficult to create
9332510 i told the players a draw is ok but we need to try to work the ball more if they make a mistake it is not a problem if we play high balls i win one time and lose eight
9332511 in the first half we were paying too much respect to our opponents maybe we were overawed by chelsea and the stadium in the second half that was a thing of the past and we managed to keep hold of the ball and our performance meant we deserved the point we got
9332512 the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent and believe in the gospel
9332513 go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature
9332514 but a woman who fears the lord she shall be praised
9332515 many daughters have done well but you excel them all
9332516 she feels parental consent is reasonable because it is required in nearly every aspect of a childs life its a parents right and responsibility to be involved in their childs life
9332517 my belief is parents have the right to know about the health and welfare of their children
9332518 im looking at him right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9332519 a significant part of palins base of support lies among social and christian conservatives her positions on social issues emerged slowly during the campaign on abortion should be banned for anything other than saving the life of the mother stem cell research opposed physician assisted suicide opposed creationism should be discussed in schools state health benefits for same sex partners opposed and supports a constitutional amendment to bar them
9332520 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both and you know i say this too as the daughter of a science teacher growing up with being so privileged and blessed to be given a lot of information on on both sides of the subject creationism and evolution its been a healthy foundation for me but dont be afraid of information and let kids debate both sides
9332521 i dont know if i want to spend time and energy growing my business were going into a recession anyway
9332522 you best watch what you are saying about the recession killing you you may just bring that on through stress
9332523 todays visitor to paris can follow jeffersons route from his house on the rue de berri down the champs elys es and across the place de la concorde to the tuileries gardens
9332524 i said earlier when the pad called on the prime minister to resign that it cant happen because he came from elections
9332525 but if one person or one hundred thousand people call on the government to show responsibility this is the democratic way house dissolution is the one way to show responsibility
9332526 it is time for the prime minister to review his role and behaviour
9332527 you should ask yourself whether you should maintain the premiership
9332528 your solutions do not show that you want to keep democracy why are the only solutions house dissolution and resignation why cant we choose the third option which is to show the world that we maintain our democracy
9332529 i thank you for the comments but sarcasm has no place in parliament
9332530 i told you before that i will not resign i will stay on to run this country
9332531 they seized government offices airports is this democracy or is this the peoples alliance to destroy democracy
9332532 the pad is preparing to up the pressure within the next few days we will enact advanced measures if samak does not resign
9332533 i have just spoken to the battalion commander in bayelsa and he confirmed to be that all his troops are intact in fact there was no encounter talk less of some people have died there was no encounter whatsoever between the militants and the military they militants keep on concocting different lie all these things are gimmicks towards portraying us to be either weak or portraying us to be wicked or incapable of handling the situation in the niger delta
9332534 at an average cost of only 50 per pair i have a style for every mood including sunglasses i could never afford sunglasses previously
9332535 i felt that this mission would give my soldiers a valuable opportunity to gain a lot of experience on the various uses and abilities of their construction equipment
9332536 plus as army engineers anytime we are authorized to destroy something its a pretty good time
9332537 i have never seen my soldiers more motivated than they were during this project
9332538 everyday each one of them looked forward to getting on the equipment and doing their part to bring down and remove big blue this project provided the soldiers a lot of opportunities to enhance their operating skills and i was amazed how much they improved each day
9332539 i just left a sporting goods store and you would think that the number one selling item would be plywood or potable water or gasoline right now

9332546 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9332547 first you have to know with no fear that someday you are going to die until you know that you are useless
9332548 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century

9332569 i wrote the book in the hopes that children will get better lives
9332570 i want to see more integration and the responsibility for that lies with the somalians themselves and with the authorities
9332571 im tired of being patient with a situation where children arent getting enough food at home where women are beaten by their husbands where welfare payments to the somalian families are used by the men to buy the narcotic khat where the willingness to simply obtain more welfare money is stronger than the ability to care for children
9332572 half of the somalians in norway have been here less than five years have little education and have problems integrating

9332609 hundreds of years ago from the 8th through the 13th century this hermitage or monastic community on the skelligs thrived as a year round dwelling for twelve or so monks

9332614 hay un desfase entre la producci n y el consumo la crisis a n no se nota en toda su dimensi n en las cuentas de las empresas
9332615 los beneficios crecen a n a tasa de dos d gitos
9332616 las malas perspectivas de negocio y la restricci n del cr dito han llevado a las empresas a frenar su inversi n
9332617 los sindicatos pon an el grito en el cielo si el peso de los salarios bajaba hacia el 50 del pib pero eso ocurr a hace mucho tiempo
9332618 con la crisis de la construcci n muchos trabajadores que se quedan sin empleo se dan de alta como aut nomos
9332619 si no lo hacemos el ajuste llegar al empleo y ser muy duro
9332620 en los ltimos a os ya ha habido moderaci n salarial
9332621 pero cuando buena parte de la subida de los precios se debe a un factor externo como el petr leo quiz la subida de los salarios deba limitarse a la inflaci n subyacente
9332622 los que meten presi n a los precios son los m rgenes empresariales
9332623 en muchos casos falta competencia entre las empresas el gobierno no hizo nada por pinchar la burbuja inmobiliaria y ahora hace muy poco con la distribuci n o los servicios
9332624 no podemos pedir todo el esfuerzo por una sola parte es importante que los empresarios se dediquen a la inversi n y al mantenimiento del empleo

9332631 el colapso del crecimiento en medio de un desempleo al alza y el endurecimiento del acceso al pr stamo sugieren que est en marcha una fuerte desaceleraci n incluso con el paquete de medidas de emergencia aprobado por el gobierno el alcance colosal de los desequilibrios espa oles apunta que lo peor est por venir
9332632 lo peor no es s lo que las restricciones financieras no vayan a mejorar a corto plazo sino que pueden incluso deteriorarse de aqu a final de a o
9332633 un sistema en el que una el ctrica obtiene financiaci n m s barata que un banco y que por tanto puede dedicarse a prestar dinero a otras compa as es un sistema que no funciona

9332663 having had two children at home at the age of four months i know how much help they need even without unfortunate medical conditions
9332664 i really feel mother knows best without the peanut gallery giving unsolicited advice she strongly conveys to women today that you dont have to choose between a successful career and motherhood you do have to make sacrifices but you can have it all
9332665 i would just trust that the child is not neglected in any way there are millions of women who work why is it that the father cannot provide the same standard of care there has been an evolving view of working women even in conservative christian circles
9332666 i didnt think the republicans would pick a female candidate for another decade but john mccain is not a typical conservative leader

9332676 numerous erroneous decisions of the georgian leadership which led to the beginning of a crisis in the caucasus
9332677 a lot of corresponding reports by osce observers in the caucasus have unofficially fallen into the hands of some governmental authorities in berlin
9332678 obama is truly a new american note american who stands on all the delicate cutting edges of americas murky politics
9332679 there is no fundamental reason that can prevent peaceful and mutually beneficial cooperation between the u s and russia
9332680 he was working as a sales representative for amoco oil co in harrisburg
9332681 biden also was an executive in a boston based company that supplied waterproof sealant for u s merchant marine ships built during world war ii after the war he co owned an airport and crop dusting service on long island
9332682 worked in the state first as a sales manager for auto dealerships and later in real estate condominium sales
9332683 the most elegantly dressed perfectly manicured perfectly tailored car sales manager wilmington del had ever seen
9332684 see for all the caterwauling you folks do about how inexperienced obama is and how that makes him unfit to be president lincoln was similarly inexperienced and he seemed to do just fine under perhaps the most extreme circumstances a president could face nice try though read up on american history
9332685 putting aside palins thin resume which makes democratic nominee barack obama look supremely experienced by contrast
9332686 now obviously im not privy to what republican sen john mccain was thinking when he chose alaska governor sarah palin as his running mate but as ive spent the day thinking about this choice it strikes me as more than a little curious putting aside palins thin resume which makes democratic nominee barack obama look supremely experienced by contrast theres the issue of a pending investigation into her role in an attempt to get an alaska state trooper fired from his job because hes palins sisters ex husband throw in palins ties to the alaska oil industry and youve got one heck of a vp candidate oh hey and did i mention mccain has only met palin once thats sure to inspire confidence and ensure chemistry for the republican ticket
9332687 thats an insult to lincoln obama will never be half the man lincoln was lincoln was not an empty suit that conned people with a bunch of phony charm
9332688 isnt it fun to watch the democrats come right out and tell women they should not vote for a woman in sarah palin strictly due to her sex yet they have no issues with people voting for obama just because they want a black president ah having it both ways the status quot for democrats the democrats have their panties tied in a knot over palin so we will see a lot of smears about her from this point forward they are already trying so far they havent come up with anything except a small family matter that no one gives a flying leap about but they will keep trying

9332691 se requiere una amplia preparaci n somos payasos que trabajamos en un ambiente especial los hospitales en condiciones distintas donde los ni os tienen otros cuidados no todos pueden correr jugar saltar no se puede entrar a todas las habitaciones igual hay algunos que incluso no quieren sonre r las enfermeras y m dicos nos orientan un poco sobre los casos y luego acudimos a cumplir nuestra meta que es hacer que se sientan un poco mejor
9332692 nosotros somos payasos no m dicos ni profesores s lo payasos lo que sucede es que en el mbito del hospital la figura de respeto es el doctor por ese motivo el payaso se coloca una bata como parte de su vestuario porque venimos a ser doctores pero del coraz n nosotros damos a los ni os alegr a los ayudamos y sacamos ese ni o interior que muchas veces se opaca por la situaci n que est n viviendo con su salud somos el doctor de la alegr a trabajamos con la risoterapia y con el amor m s altruista
9332693 el beb no quer a nada aparte la madre estaba demasiado triste y en esos casos debemos ayudar mucho a los padres quienes tambi n necesitan mejorar su estado de nimo para transmitirlo a los ni os porque los padres pasan d as de angustia sin dormir con problemas econ micos por la cantidad de medicamentos que deben adquirir y est n muy afectados se debe hacer de todo hasta que tanto el ni o como la madre mejoren y en esa primera visita precisamente lo logramos la madre al ver a su hijo feliz en medio de su dolor tambi n logr sonre r prolongadamente
9332694 nos ense an a no pegarnos con los ni os pero es casi imposible hemos creado una gran afinidad con varios ni os que llevan meses en el hospital recuper ndose de una enfermedad a veces salimos afectados y nos reunimos para drenar lo que sentimos pero no podemos demostrar nada de eso frente a los ni os y sus padres porque nuestro trabajo es alegrarles la vida no hay nada m s duro que ver a un peque o padeciendo pero aprendemos a sobrellevarlo

9332702 din masuk dalam daftar cawapres dia punya potensi terkait aktivitas di masyarakat itu jadi modal
9332703 wegen der h heren temperaturen hatte ich nicht ganz die pace der trainingstage
9332704 und daher rutschte ich mehr es war das erste rennen mit dem neuen chassis und mit der neuen frontkonstruktion von bridgestone daher war es eine gute leistung wenn man bedenkt was in der ersten runde passiert ist die reifen waren so gut dass ich meine schnellste runde in der 25 von 28 runden fuhr wenn ich von anfang an vorne dabei gewesen w re w re bestimmt noch mehr drin gewesen
9332705 wir h tten heute noch besser abschneiden k nnen aber die fahrer haben ihre sache gut gemacht in misano kann man sehr schwer berholen doch umso bemerkenswerter war chris vorstellung er hatte die pace um auf das podium zu kommen aber von so weit hinten hatte er nat rlich keine realistische chance mehr
9332706 vielleicht haben wir ein bisschen zu viel ver ndert und sind dadurch vom weg abgekommen
9332707 es war ein schwieriges wochenende denn wir besch ftigten uns viel mit dem neuen chassis
9332708 vielleicht haben wir ein bisschen zu viel ver ndert und sind dadurch vom weg abgekommen aber am ende war es in ordnung ich musste vor dem rennen noch den vorderreifen wechseln denn mit dem anderen hatte ich kein gutes gef hl die reifen wurden bei mir besser je l nger das rennen dauerte
9332709 ich denke die performance die mein team und ich gezeigt haben war das ganze wochenende ber gut aber alles hat sich ein bisschen ge ndert als ich im letzten qualifying keinen dritten gang mehr hatte ich musste von platz sieben starten
9332710 wir wussten dass ich den speed habe aber auf dieser strecke spielt die aerodynamik eine gro e rolle und es ist sehr hinter einem auto herzufahren und zu berholen ist noch schwieriger vor allem wenn die autos mehr oder weniger gleich schnell sind
9332711 als dann alle in die box gegangen sind wusste ich was zu tun war
9332712 ich habe ich gesehen dass timo und paul davonziehen konnten weil bruno spengler nicht ihre pace hatte als dann alle in die box gegangen sind wusste ich was zu tun war
9332713 im zweiten und im letzten stint hatte ich freie fahrt und konnte ein gutes rennen fahren es wurde dann noch der dritte platz aber ich hatte mir ein bisschen mehr erwartet als ich am freitag hierhergekommen bin
9332714 wir mussten uns also etwas au ergew hnliches einfallen lassen und es war ein au ergew hnlicher tag
9332715 ich bin der fahrer ich sitze im auto und versuche aus dem was ich habe das beste zu machen
9332716 das team entscheidet ber die strategie und versucht die umst nde zu beurteilen und daraus das beste zu machen sie wussten dass man hier schlecht berholen kann wir mussten uns also etwas au ergew hnliches einfallen lassen und es war ein au ergew hnlicher tag
9332717 im vergangenen jahr war es auch recht eng das saisonende hatte noch einiges an dramatik zu bieten
9332718 neun punkte mag zwar nach viel klingen und wenn man langweilige rennen ohne viel action hat ist das sicher ein sch ner vorsprung
9332719 da muss noch nicht einmal der fahrer daran schuld sein das team holt die ergebnisse das vergisst man leicht wir haben viele mechaniker die unsere boxenstopps machen und wir alle stehen unter druck sie machen im moment einen wirklich guten job unsere boxenstopps sind klasse aber jeder muss weiter bis zum schluss konzentriert bleiben

9332850 ping pong was invented on the dining tables of england in the 19th century and it was called whiff whaff
9332851 there you have the essential difference between us and the rest of the world
9332852 the french might look at a dining table and see an opportunity to eat we looked at it and saw the opportunity to play whiff whaff
9332853 i watched mr johnsons speech on television and i was appalled it looked like he had carried out some research but not quite enough
9332854 its criminal really and you would have thought he would be better informed
9332855 what he said is like saying the english invented the hoover but at the time it was called a dyson mr hoover would be furious just as my family is about this mistake
9332856 i say to the chinese and the rest of the world that ping pong is coming home athletics is coming home and sport is coming home
9332857 his speech was hugely patronising about the national sport of china he suggested it was just an after dinner pastime when it is also now a hugely competitive sport in our country as well
9332858 if the mayor is so concerned with the history of the sport then why has nobody from his office approached the originators and only uk makers of the sport jaques of london and asked about tables for the olympics yet
9332859 i stand by my assertion that whiff whaff and ping pong are one and the same thing with the whiffs predating the pongs
9332860 regardless of semantics though it is a sport of which we should be proud and i look forward to watching it in 2012

9332956 he never hurt me i was the one pressing forward and landing all my shots and theres no way he beat me thats how the fight looked on tape with the bout and tonights rematch not shown on american television ruiz who is known for his hit grab and clutch tactics turned things around in his encounter with valuev it was valuev who would fight defensively throwing mostly arm punches while not using his huge advantages in weight and leverage with his shots and who was relegated to holding after throwing a few shots on the other hand ruiz showing no fear would come forward landing many body and face shots and seemed to be clearly ahead by three or four points but in the end one judge would turn in a 114 114 verdict on his scorecard while the other two judges would have it 116 112 each for valuev whose face resigned to an expected defeat would turn to amazed delight as he was proclaimed the new title holder valuev lost the title less than two years later to ruslan chagaev and with ruiz in hot pursuit ever since the doors opened for the rematch and a chance for the new england native to reclaim the title after chagaev was plagued by injuries forcing the wba to make this bout an interim title bout ruiz whose long time relationship with fiery norman stone was terminated some time ago is currently working with manny siaca sr and the quietman has stated that after he defeats valuev he will not hear any boos as he did after the russian was proclaimed the new champion in 2005 i have a new team and its been great

9332976 i have said that i do not like having to come to the conclusions that i come to i do not like where my inquiries leave me this explains why there is reluctance among the general public to recognize who the authors of 9 11 are this is why people accept what the media has to say when it is apparent they are lying this is why they do not question in public because such questioning leaves them exposed and being exposed is like being naked conversely exposing the lies of powerful interests can cause problems when it interferes with their profits and agendas the world is a lie and what the world conceals cannot be seen by lying eyes they only see the world and fear what lies behind the world beneath the costumery of this world is hidden our humanity and our secret heart beneath the camouflage and masquerade lie our common brotherhood and our true self my gratitude and congratulations to those of you who know that you are naked underneath your clothes that are not afraid to show yourselves as you are because there is no shame in the truth when the truth takes off her clothes then the world disappears

9333078 a politician of eye popping integrity the most popular governor in america with an approval rating in the 90s and probably the most popular public official in any state her rise is a great and rare story of how adherence to principle especially to transparency and accountability in government can produce political success
9333079 the landscape is littered with the bodies of those who crossed her
9333080 quand les jeunes populistes viennent faire de la provocation la rochelle
9333081 no way to tell where its coming down and anyway the enginell catch
9333082 i dont care if you can do makeup or not the only reason you got the job here is because you are hot
9333083 i cant say specifically how many people are still stranded in floods
9333084 but their numbers are in lakhs hundreds of thousands and we require more resources more boats army and rescue efforts to evacuate them
9333085 i think harper is in a position of weakness he looks ahead and sees change coming in the united states he sees the economy softening he sees a recession coming he possibly sees a deficit accumulating
9333086 this is a government that promised it wouldnt tax income trusts and broke the promise that devastated the savings of a million canadians this is a government that promised it was going to give us more childcare spaces which matters to every canadian family i dont see a childcare space out there
9333087 this is not an election about stephane dion this is an election is about stephen harper do you have enough faith he will not break promises again
9333088 we have to make sure we listen to all canadians those who make their living pouring diesel into tractors for example those make their living pouring diesel into boats my sense is that its important that we listen to the people who produce our food
9333089 he wants an election in the best interests of his party
9333090 i got no sense the prime minister is prepared to do what i would do if i were prime minister
9333091 a green mp sitting in the house of commons it will now be impossible to exclude the green party from the televised leaders debates in the next election
9333092 our view is there should only be one liberal candidate in the leaders debate
9333093 you cant have two candidates from essentially the same party in the debate
9333094 many doctors are seeing between 30 and 40 patients per day
9333095 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9333096 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9333097 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion
9333098 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9333099 your pocketbook is closer to your heart than your political preference its a truth revelation mechanism
9333100 with a bet youre kind of locked in with the ubc ecm if you see the fortunes of a party falling youre going to sell
9333101 it became clear to us that the amount of time we spent taking care of pennies wasnt valuable in the long run
9333102 they think its a really good idea especially since parliament has been discussing getting rid of the penny its something the country is kind of moving towards
9333103 its something the cafe management thought was really great so were trying it out
9333104 if it continues to go well youll probably see this in our other cafes too
9333105 at the end of the day our cash is rarely off by very much
9333106 but i think at the same time the amount of time its going to save everyone would be outstanding
9333107 i think weve triggered an irreversible shift towards abolishing the penny
9333108 but i dont blame the local retailer for losing patience and unilaterally taking action
9333109 i dont expect to deal with that in the near future
9333110 the reason there are so many is because the penny is not used
9333111 there are still some people here and there that want to keep the penny as a symbol of heritage and the past the government doesnt want to put these people against them
9333112 all the progress weve made other than public opinion would be lost if an election takes place
9333113 but it gives us an opportunity to make it an election issue
9333114 i suggest we hold a birthday party and a funeral simultaneously and not issue any 2009 pennies
9333115 i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9333116 ive been so focused on state government i havent really focused much on the war in iraq

9333123 he wants to do something service oriented if and when the storm hits and its as bad as its expected to be now
9333124 at first they were just two bumps but they started to grow quickly and after a month there were two wings
9333125 a month ago many female cats in heat came to harass him and then the wings started to grow
9333126 peace must be pursued in line with the universal interest of all filipinos whether muslim christian or lumad peace cannot happen with disunity with a people partitioned according to race or belief
9333127 and this peace must be pursued by a government that rules with the consent of the governed that gives all citizens equal protection under the law
9333128 this government has managed to divide and fragment our nation through the years and now by bungling on the peace process with the milf ineptness and impatience prevailed and deception to all muslim christian or lumad was employed to pursue an invalid memorandum of agreement with the milf
9333129 it must first of all bring all lawless elements to justice all those who violate human rights and rule of law be it milf splinter groups or other vigilantes must be brought to justice the government must smother mindanao with the rule of law
9333130 the moa between the government and the milf must be torn apart and we want the supreme court to do so through a definitive decision so it will no longer be used as leverage in peace negotiations and diplomatic discourse on the part of the government it must revamp the peace panel now

9333140 i thank michelin and honda for their understanding and for agreeing to my personal demands
9333141 i am very conscious of the fact that i have made some excessively negative comments about michelin tyres even though michelin helped me make an exceptional start to the season
9333142 mr dake has committed to upholding all aspects of the sanctity of life in his legislative votes and activities he is the only endorsed candidate in the race for the 132nd missouri house seat
9333143 governor blunts perpetual ratings with his base remains extremely strong as well with 79 of republicans having a favorable opinion of him and only 15 having an unfavorable opinion
9333144 while the governors job approval may not be ideal it is much better than some of the robo polls have reported with a plurality of missourians approving of the job he is doing
9333145 the difficult decisions governor blunt had to make to bring fiscal responsibility undoubtedly hurt his approval ratings somewhat as have the constant attacks from democrats however 47 of voters approve of the job he is doing and 46 disapprove in light of all that
9333146 considering this survey was in the field on the heels of a primary where many of the democrats spent their time focusing on attacks on the governor rather than battling their own opponents this is very good news for the long term legacy of governor blunt
9333147 i am really happy here and especially enjoy working with head coach david capel and the coaching staff
9333148 monty is a key member of our plans going forward and we are all delighted he will be continuing his association with a club that he has been on the professional staff since 1999 and as a capped player from 2006

9333153 it is probably fortunate that i have persuaded the legion to step up their border patrols
9333154 i am expecting reinforcements to arrive tomorrow and expect your full co operation
9333155 and dont look so disgusted they tell me theyre sending veterans from the zughru wars so theyre men kandar and human who know how to fight and im summoning their commanding officer her as soon as he arrives so that you and i can brief then on the situation understood good
9333156 are the academy of life just growing bigger and better turnips or is there something more sinister going on
9333157 we dont really understand the magic of the academy of life our reconnaissance did pick up a lot of academy of life comings and goings to and from the village
9333158 we all know how the kandar fear the rate at which we breed
9333159 turnips are cover they have something nastier in the works
9333160 which were not going to find out about unless we raid their research complex at guvil bridge grodd replied
9333161 guvil bridge is off limits but i know enough about the academy of life to know their black projects are never based at their publicly known facilities theres something going on at or near gavuis hill that needs a stop putting to and i intend to find out what it is

9333169 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9333170 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9333171 we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
9333172 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million americans how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement
9333173 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
9333174 im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
9333175 as was immediately predicted by john mccain after he made the remark barack obama is already distorting his comment about the definition of rich in america
9333176 across some of the most dangerous seas in the world
9333177 that has not been decided we need a few more hours to look at all of the contingencies but there will be some substantial adjustments
9333178 its a dire outlook and we need to make some changes
9333179 but this has never happened before to anyones convention so we need some time to touch all the bases
9333180 he wants to do something service oriented if and when the storm hits and its as bad as its expected to be now
9333181 you need to get your life together man promise me

9333185 the most critical issue that threatens the whole peace process now
9333186 we cant have this done by 9 a m sunday
9333187 the state is inching its way toward insolvency because we couldnt reach an agreement
9333188 its very difficult when a two thirds majority requires republican votes that a republican governor cant get
9333189 this is a compromise but schwarzenegger is going to have to enforce that compromise
9333190 since sen peratas budget failed and the republican budget is likely to fail leaders in both parties should put the governors compromise budget up for a vote
9333191 it is a fair middle of the road compromise and he would sign it today
9333192 but this shows you can do a budget without taxes thats responsible
9333193 its the basis for a very good compromise in the next step
9333194 the republican proposal isnt a plan its a blueprint for economic disaster
9333195 two billion in borrowing from a phony lottery scheme and 1 5 billion in cuts to the safety net for our most needy citizens are not reflective of california values
9333196 for us to be anywhere but here ready to take up a budget bill would be unwise
9333197 we are fighting this war this is our war there is no question of americas dictation
9333198 the operation in swat is in high gear but the holy months sanctity requires that people spend it in peace and harmony
9333199 good kind lighthearted awesome lovable guy he had a really happy good life
9333200 its just such a horrible freak accident that can happen like this it shouldnt happen to such a nice guy
9333201 he was a part of the 49ers faithful for many years
9333202 whenever we lose a loyal fan like that its a loss to the whole 49ers family

9333211 it was a decision taken by the guard who has committed a serious error
9333212 they prevent the identification of the person and are an obstacle to the interaction with others
9333213 they have been targeted by a series of highly intimidating sweeping police raids across the city involving teams of 25 30 officers in riot gear with semi automatic weapons drawn entering homes of those suspected of planning protests handcuffing and forcing them to lay on the floor while law enforcement officers searched the homes seizing computers journals and political pamphlets
9333214 jane hamsher and i were at two of those homes this morning one which had just been raided and one which was in the process of being raided
9333215 videotaped police behavior at the 2004 gop convention in new york and helped get charges dismissed against hundreds of protesters who were arrested
9333216 you cant put this genie back in its bottle there never was a bottle
9333217 theres going to be a diffusion of viewpoints people are going to find it easier than ever to find one viewpoint they like and will stick with that
9333218 rigging or slanting the news is a most heinous act against the public interest
9333219 youre looking at a half a per cent lower gdp growth in the first and second quarters which means there is more slack in the economy
9333220 the argument is when we think about it in very general terms the argument is that the case for sustained low interest rates is i think overwhelming
9333221 basically were looking at a broader based and probably more material global slowdown than people were thinking a month or two ago
9333222 i think youre seeing more softness abroad than people anticipated and youre looking at more of a policy response catching up to what the u s has done

9333224 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
9333225 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
9333226 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
9333227 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
9333228 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
9333229 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
9333230 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
9333231 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
9333232 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
9333233 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
9333234 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
9333235 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
9333236 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
9333237 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
9333238 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
9333239 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
9333240 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
9333241 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
9333242 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
9333243 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
9333244 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
9333245 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
9333246 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
9333247 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
9333248 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
9333249 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
9333250 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
9333251 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
9333252 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
9333253 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
9333254 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
9333255 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
9333256 summers almost over fading like a tan vacation time is running out like an unplugged fan
9333257 the conservative government believes that money should go to help farmers not former liberal cabinet ministers
9333258 prime minister stephen harper will meet with liberal leader stephane dion in ottawa on monday to talk about whether an election is the way to settle differences among the parties in a parliament that harper says has become increasingly dysfunctional the labour day talk is scheduled for 4 p m et at the prime ministers residence at 24 sussex drive the prime minister has met with other opposition leaders in the past two days ostensibly to determine whether there is common ground to avoid a fall election
9333259 i remember him talking about her when he came back
9333260 he said she was an impressive woman he liked her

9333269 yes it was great he is very sweet and very chilled out he does not loose his temper and sees work as fun he makes things easier for the singer as well so that it is a win win situation for both
9333270 in the song maduraikku pogadhedi the female chorus singers accidentally laughed during the recording and rahman thought that sounded nice and used it instead of a line in the song
9333271 i have no expectations i just want to be recognised and make people happy with my songs music to me is the food of life i live to sing
9333272 i try to be versatile and am always ready for the worst
9333273 i enjoy singing and thats shown on the stage as well when we perform on stage we need to be more interactive
9333274 i dont let success get into my head so when i dont change people around me dont change as well
9333275 they have moved up in the world from hopeless to hopeful
9333276 the odds certainly favor the lions finally breaking that glass ceiling into mediocrity
9333277 they wanted to talk to me is what i was told to talk to me about the position and my understanding was that others were still being considered so i didnt know what to expect except to go to arizona and speak with the senator be myself and let him know what i had to offer but not campaign for the job and again pleasantly surprised and quite honored
9333278 when the conversation wrapped up he asked would i like to join him in this and i said if i can help the country and i can help you on the ticket then absolutely i would be honored
9333279 we were in sedona at his home there outside on his lawn as he and i spoke and evidently you know kyle they have been doing a tremendous amount of background work on not just me but other potential candidates and that had been obviously ongoing for many many months because they had my information
9333280 i am kyle and i am up to the task of course of focusing on the challenges that face america and i am very pleased with the situation i am in when you consider the situation alaska will be in and that is alaska and alaskans will be allowed to contribute more to our great county and they will be allowed to do that because if we are elected i will be in a position to open the eyes of the country to what it is that alaska is all about and what alaska has to offer so happy to and very honored to be asked to do this i know it is going to be great for alaska and with senator mccain at the helm our country is going to be so much better off because he is of reform and no more politics as usual tackling the touch challenges that face america and as vice president i am happy to be allowed to participate in this reform movement if we are elected
9333281 no not when you consider kyle that i did not pressure commissioner monegan to hire or fire anybody and commissioner monegan again confirmed that today as he had been confirming all along but i think that has been ignored so no im not worried about that
9333282 i honestly did think it was out of the realm of possibilty i knew that the senator and i we would have an inherent connection though with our mission being reform and putting the people first before any party or personal interest ive known all along he was such a maverick that we would have a connection but i didnt know if he knew enough about me to seriously be a consideration 3 00 because as you know kyle what ive done up there in alaska is ive taken steps to do those things that i think now can be done on a national level also so that we can see that reform that americans are creating and are deserving and senator mccain has done his entire career as well going up against a lot of influence that has been undue influence in some cases in policy making in washington dc he and i have done many of the same things but he on a much grander scale
9333283 the true story of the bi lder ber g group

9333300 but nobody else gets to sit in this exact seat
9333301 im just a dude from fairfield i want to experience the things im supposed to experience i want to go to the movies i want to walk down the street if a regular person wants to take my picture thats ok
9333302 but today its all about the image a person sticks a blackberry in my face and snaps a photo ok why not just say hello and shake hands i dont mind talking with people and if it gets out of control id just say ok gotta go its getting a little crazy

9333304 i dont know i think i might need to build a life somewhere other than l a or new york
9333305 ive got some great smart friends there but the aggressiveness of the paparazzi is really out of control

9333372 sometimes being a registered sex offender can be a fate worse than death
9333373 it is obviously distressing for police to see a young child abused and continued to be abused over a long period of time and not be able to identify or remove them from harm
9333374 some of these people are collectors they want a whole series of a particular child growing up being abused
9333375 the thing is the offender knows we are closing in we are very worried about her safety
9333376 they were held up around the world as the lead players the ones who could defeat any law enforcement agency anywhere
9333377 what made this group different was the level of security used to protect their identity and restrict membership of the group
9333378 they would change their passwords on a regular basis they would change their encryption keys on a regular basis and use codenames even within the group
9333379 this is the greatest group of pedos to ever gather in one place and im honoured just to be a part of it
9333380 to be honest we were not sure if we could break through the security but we wanted to try
9333381 we were able to come up with a number of reasons and stories as to why we didnt that is our general strategy
9333382 the difficulty for us is that some people think that a subscriber type of operation is of no value
9333383 but any one of those people could be a high level sex offender when we go to knock on that door we dont know what is behind it
9333384 the filmmaker his website were just one of many providers for this group and they just continued on

9333404 kami sudah menyurati kadis pertamanan medan bahkan walikota medan agar billboard pt rap dibongkar karena najogi yang berhak atas lokasi itu tapi tidak ditanggapi dan akhirnya diproses secara hukum sementara hal penggunaan billboard itu tetap dipakai yang notabene disetujui pemko medan c q dinas pertamanan
9333405 billboard kami yang lebih dulu mendapat izin dan telah membayar retribusi pajak ke pemerintah namun sekarang tertutupi iklan billboard milik rap padahal izin pemasangan billboard yang dimiliki rap lokasinya di jalan zainul arifin depan bii tidak dimanfaatkan malah mengambil lokasi hak najogi
9333406 sudah lelah dan capek saya mengadu kepada kadis pertamanan juga ke walikota tapi sama sekali tidak ditanggapi sempat terjadi negosiasi dengan pemko dan kami dijanjikan mendapat kompensasi sejumlah uang dan lokasi pengganti nyatanya hingga kini tidak pernah terealisasi kami sudah menjadi korban persekongkolan antara oknum pejabat di pemko dengan pengusaha besar
9333407 kenapa kadis pertamanan tidak memerintahkan pt rap yang harus membongkar billboardnya kok justru kami yang memiliki legalitas yang harus dikeluarkan
9333408 najogi hanya memiliki tiga billboard saja tapi itupun tidak bisa berbisnis dengan nyaman apa pengusaha kecil sudah tidak bisa lagi berusaha di kota ini apa pengusaha pribumi memang harus ditekan tekan dalam berbisnis di kota ini
9333409 sound poetry is not about semantic content but patterns of sound

9333455 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
9333456 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
9333457 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice

9333472 power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years
9333473 this goal is so far outside the realm of possibility
9333474 it would be practically infeasible politically impossible and economically and environmentally unwise
9333475 im not going to say hes going to win the young vote
9333476 but i think by the end of the campaign there are going to be a lot of young voters saying john mccain is the best fit to lead the country
9333477 if theres some perilous situation going on i think bush might bow out
9333478 whether you agree with how hes running the country or not he should speak
9333479 weve got to remember our economy is technically not in a recession but our economy is still growing
9333480 anyone who tries to say john mccain is another george bush thats a ludicrous claim
9333481 thats part of what these things are for to compare and contrast
9333482 companies dont make incredible concessions like this because they want to be good guys it was in allstates financial interest there was too much at stake since hurricane katrina a lot of big time private lawyers have tried to get at this but florida got what nobody else did
9333483 u s recession and recovery u v or w shaped
9333484 theres been debate about whether its v shaped or u shaped
9333485 trying to make a desperate situation look sort of technical its not that much of a fuss the big boys can take care of it dont you worry
9333486 except the big boys here their trousers are getting a little short im afraid
9333487 this could extend itself well into 2009 with repercussions that could keep the country stagnant for two or three years
9333488 were not expecting this to be a hockey stick in the true sense of a hockey stick of a year at all

9333493 theres no question that charlie crist was on the very short list
9333494 he was totally vetted and could have gotten the call he could be a candidate in his own right four years from now
9333495 were saying yes to iowa south carolina and new hampshire
9333496 he was a finalist in the thoughts of the next president of the united states
9333497 that is the closest any floridian has come to being on the national ticket and its an honor for the governor it also shows that charlie crist is the future of the republican party
9333498 despite empty chair charlies best attempt to run away from the economic mess his failed policies have created in florida his year long efforts to suck up to john mccain didnt work
9333499 with floridas families suffering under the republican recession maybe crist will finally roll up his sleeves and get to work fixing the many issues facing the sunshine state given his track record i am not sure i would hold my breath
9333500 it was kind and thoughtful of him to go ahead and make a call before the announcement was made and let me know he was going forward in a different direction
9333501 i think they wanted to engage and diffuse the obama mantra about change and innovation
9333502 theres a lingering dynamic from the hillary campaign and disappointment in which gender is a strong factor
9333503 but for the incoming freshmen it will affect them those people who have dealt with charlie before and have known him before this notoriety it will have no impact
9333504 hes still influential in congress he still has supporters in congress and in the district
9333505 its really the great unknown in terms of whether people will rally around jefferson or whether they just say weve had enough
9333506 the republican party is more southern than it has ever been in its history but you wont see anything proportionate to the representation of southern republicans in congress
9333507 these guys are modern republicans who run in unlikely places its mccains start to reach out to the middle
9333508 its like a beauty contest they put the speakers in front that will have the greatest appeal
9333509 we want to make sure we put forward the great diversity of the party
9333510 there is an effort to reach out to voters in traditional democratic states and that is consistent with the type of campaign john mccain is running
9333511 the program is reflective of the road traveled by the candidate on the way to the nomination
9333512 this is exactly what they did at the convention in 2004
9333513 the party wanted to present a moderate front because they realized it would most appeal to the general electorate
9333514 it will have a very serious impact on the convention
9333515 when one part of the country is getting hurt its hard to have a national celebration
9333516 but its all a continuum of what started back then the freedom riders dr king and the civil rights movement beginning back in the late fifties and early sixties
9333517 i understand that im in congress because of martin luther king and lyndon baines johnson
9333518 this convention is a historic moment for women as well as african americans
9333519 for some of the working class white males especially one of the problems that obamas going to have with that group is affirmative action because theyve been passed over for a promotion or their child hasnt gotten a scholarship or something along that line that has affected them economically
9333520 i dont think were totally there yet and i dont know if we ever will be unless the entire country is beige
9333521 but everything that dr king and others did to the point that they couldnt do it anymore has brought us to this particular day
9333522 some people just dont trust him for whatever reason not necessarily that theres been a lot of misinformation put out about the man ties to the muslim faith and that sort of thing that still resonates with some people
9333523 thats from an old negro spiritual his steps have been ordered and the reason why im saying that is whoever would have thought it would happen
9333524 i think people will couch their reluctance to vote for obama in qualifications or any number of things whether he is a real american there will be things that they will use so that even they wont have to look at the racial issue
9333525 i believe that is the only reason he would lose the color of his skin he certainly has the qualifications he has the credentials he has the integrity
9333526 i see a cohesiveness now that ive not seen before and i truly believe america is ready for the change that is about to take place
9333527 we dont want to build a giant factory that the market doesnt need or want
9333528 investors like to know what tax policies apply when they are putting millions of dollars down on a project theres a pretty clear history that these projects are less likely to go forward without a credit
9333529 these companies are shutting down projects firing people and its congresss fault
9333530 i think our town has gotten to experience things that few other towns in america ever get
9333531 i dont think we will become the hotspot vacation place you have to go visit
9333532 when i come here out of washington d c to a place like crawford texas im reminded of the great values of our beloved texas and the values of faith and family and friendship that you find in places like crawford
9333533 we love to come to crawford we view it as our home
9333534 i think the main thing people in crawford wanted was a grocery store
9333535 then i got a message saying they were all in baghdad
9333536 they came and ate that night but that was one of the great things you never knew what was going to happen i am going to miss all of that the people and the fun
9333537 the thing people in washington didnt understand about this place is that it can be very beautiful and especially in springtime when the wildflowers are blooming
9333538 for some of the other caterers its about the money but for me not seeing these guys here all the time is going to be strange and sad
9333539 everything is being considered but at the present time there is no change to the schedule
9333540 are on the table you may see a reduction in some of the events
9333541 as devastating an incident as anything for the bush administration
9333542 anything that refocuses attention away from mccain and back to bush is not good for mccain
9333543 this is not going to be a repeat of katrina those states are very prepared
9333544 giving consideration to the events that are taking place people will see that the republican party and those governors are focused on serving the citizens in those states
9333545 im prepared to be president of the united states and ill put my country first
9333546 against the doomsday climate change scenarios peddled by the aficionados of centralized command and control government
9333547 a ban on the creation of or experimentation on human embryos for research purposes
9333548 as a vice presidential candidate hed suddenly have to become a partisan attack dog which probably isnt his strongest suit and one of the reasons he wont be on the ticket
9333549 hes lowered the political bickering and partisanship in a way that voters across this nation appreciate and want
9333550 i think hes a governor that doesnt fail to tackle the tough issues and americans want that too
9333551 im in the most contested senate race in the state of florida
9333552 to get people excited you need a mix of good candidates
9333553 its a strategy and it did not happen by chance
9333554 stronger parties that are better organized can better recruit candidates because they know they have a better chance of winning
9333555 our concentration is voter turnout which is something we do well and they do not
9333556 at the end of the day its about who gets the most votes
9333557 florida at large is fiscally conservative and socially moderate and depending on the issue one of those sides takes more prominence
9333558 people arent going to donate unless they think you have a good chance of winning
9333559 when you have a great bunch of candidates that can only help voter turnout
9333560 now our voters have plenty of reasons to come out to the polls and vote the entire ballot
9333561 sarasota is gaining national attention because if sarasota goes obama the state goes obama and then the country goes obama
9333562 we can help deliver the state of florida by having a strong republican turnout
9333563 we have got to make sure that we can fight against this wave that the obama campaign has out there
9333564 we know that the democrats are energized and charged up we need to have that energy and that same passion
9333565 the jewish vote is up for grabs this year in the state of florida
9333566 were going to fight for every vote in the jewish community
9333567 i think there is still a lot of doubt and uncertainty in the jewish community about senator obama and so im excited
9333568 americans have a clear choice in november john mccain offers more of the same failed policies that endanger america and israel
9333569 women are going to be the determining factor in this race
9333570 we are very sensitive to the impact of energy prices of all forms on our customers particularly electricity prices
9333571 but this is a global issue we are addressing its really a new energy reality
9333572 our position has always been that theres more cost effective options than nuclear power
9333573 when those plants go into service our customers will see in excess of 1 billion a year in fuel savings
9333574 i think what he learned from the 2000 primary was to fight back and not take anything for granted
9333575 thats why when obama said that john would use that obama doesnt look like the other presidents on dollar bills and that he had a funny last name that john didnt let that go unaddressed
9333576 i find myself surprised by some of the tactics that ive seen in the last few weeks
9333577 they dont seem like the tactics of the john mccain i know
9333578 i responded by getting angry on the stump and running negative ads about my opponent that only raised the toxic level of the primary
9333579 we should have refuted the above the radar attacks in our own ads challenged bushs positions and in my speeches stuck to the message of reform and patriotism
9333580 i will not take the low road to the highest office in the land
9333581 i want the presidency in the best way not the worst way
9333582 mccain coming in to some of those districts in the weekend before the election was the margin of error largely allowing us to keep the house of representatives
9333583 in marginal seats this wasnt a hard right guy he was the acceptable guy this wasnt bush mccain was the good housekeeping seal of approval
9333584 hes a soldier this is a guy who was beaten up for years at a pow camp and was one of the first lawmakers to call for the recognition of vietnam
9333585 he can get angry but he gets over it and at the end of the day he reconciles just as he did with the vietnamese and bush
9333586 i think a lot of his actions in 2001 to 2003 when he was actively opposing the president were rooted in south carolina
9333587 he shoved campaign finance down the presidents throat and he opposed the tax cuts
9333588 they needed each other bush needed mccain and his great appeal among moderate voters and mccain needed to show conservatives that he was doing everything to get bush re elected
9333589 i thought he was a lot more naive in 2000 he had kind of a cotton candy and ice cream campaign
9333590 in 2008 he was much more willing to go after his rivals romney and rudy giuliani hes learned to be a tougher campaigner
9333591 hes more experienced he knows when to be hard on the campaign trail and when to be soft and discuss his shortcomings
9333592 this is a complete abrogation of the presidential public financing system
9333593 it was specifically set up to get corporate money out of the conventions
9333594 motivated by a desire to promote the convention city and not by political considerations
9333595 teams of elected officials at all levels of government from the convention party and their associates in the partys network of financiers and operatives
9333596 basically republican elected officials their financiers and party operatives are asking for money to fund the republican convention while democratic ones are doing the same thing for the democratic convention
9333597 we are trying to relieve the burden that would otherwise fall on the local community
9333598 these companies have come together not because of politics but to showcase our cities
9333599 a soft money loophole because congress banned any unlimited donations from corporations unions and wealthy individuals to political parties
9333600 when you get unlimited contributions like this largely corporate you get the potential for powerful concentrated wealth to earn the gratitude of the next president and other elected federal officials they can eventually cash it in for special attention
9333601 it is not unlike what goes on in washington every day of the year
9333602 we have to make sure the focus is on the south on gustav make sure that all of the resources are there and that anything that is done with regard to the convention doesnt take anything away from that and is done in a serious way
9333603 senator mccain has already indicated that it would be inappropriate to have celebrations that things have to be scaled back
9333604 we are dealing with a community that is economically disadvantaged educationally and linguistically challenged and geographically removed from services
9333605 very difficult process to be eligible for the funding deadline
9333606 generally we encourage all developers to be looking at development sites that arent going to harm habitat for species and wetlands but thats hard to do because theres wetlands in collier county almost everywhere
9333607 wootens words were i will kill him hell eat a expletive lead bullet ill shoot him if our father got the attorney to help molly
9333608 i heard this death threat my 16 year old son heard it track palin molly heard it as did their small children wooten spoke with his trooper gun on his hip in an extremely intimidating fashion leaving no doubt he is serious about taking someones life who disagrees with him
9333609 my concern is that the publics faith in the troopers will continue to diminish as more residents express concerns regarding the apparent lack of action towards a trooper whom is described by many as a ticking time bomb and a loose cannon
9333610 wooten is my brother in law but this information is forwarded to you objectively
9333611 the landscape up here is littered with people who have underestimated her
9333612 maybe she is not ready for prime time or maybe she is going to litter the national landscape with people who have underestimated her
9333613 the previous governor had like a 20 approval rating they were tired of this just relentless brute ignoring the public mentality then the fbi raids all she had to do was show up and she got elected
9333614 theres always been a little bit of an air of an opportunist about the governor
9333615 it would be incorrect to say the bill came from the governor
9333616 theres a real question whether shes a republican or a democrat
9333617 she has succeeded in her own limited policy agenda as a republican governor by having the democrat caucus in lock step with her
9333618 her administration had the appearance of paying absolutely no attention to any of the rest of the unglamorous side of government
9333619 whether it be dealing with human services public services highways all the routine aspects
9333620 but couldnt be bothered to do anything in the closing days of the legislature when she could have helped it through
9333621 she said you know i go to these debates and im just amazed at your grasp of issues and facts
9333622 and you know im a policy guy and im thinking yeah but people didnt care she has a way of walking in a room and filling the room with her presence so people suddenly forget about their concerns about healthcare or education or anything else
9333623 gov palin will serve our country with distinction the first alaskan and first woman on the republican ticket i share in the pride of all alaskans
9333624 i will actively support the mccain palin ticket to be elected our next president and vice president
9333625 shes a total beginner on national and international issues gov palin will have to spend the next two months convincing americans that shes ready to be a heartbeat away from the presidency
9333626 literally like if the redskins had just won the super bowl
9333627 people were high fiving giving each other hugs smiling from ear to ear it was euphoria
9333628 ive been arguing for a long time that john mccain would have to pick someone who would not just satisfy conservatives but send them running back to him
9333629 and with this selection john mccain hit it out of the park
9333630 even those of us who supported other candidates are four square behind john mccain
9333631 when i saw the e mail confirming palins selection i was like wow weve really got a complete ticket the democratic ticket is all about making history but our ticket is about leadership experience and making history so we sort of kill two birds with one stone
9333632 a lot of those 18 million clinton voters feel disenfranchised and betrayed
9333633 the president is highly unpopular there doesnt seem to be much excitement around the candidate and theres a real fear of being tagged with the republican label and being seen with george bush
9333634 if the convention wasnt in st paul i wouldnt be at the convention
9333635 i want you to ask yourselves were you in the campaign just for me
9333636 what will your members do when hillary tells them to vote for obama
9333637 ive never ever looked at a republican candidate i am now
9333638 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
9333639 to my supporters to my champions to my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you thank you because you never gave in and you never gave up
9333640 and i know that on thursday night at the stadium ill cry again
9333641 something is happening in america and people are prepared and ready to make that great leap
9333642 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
9333643 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
9333644 and it wont work in 2008 because is on the right side of history
9333645 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
9333646 i think as well today of two other women who came before me in national elections and i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievements of geraldine ferraro back in 1984 and of course senator hillary clinton
9333647 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9333648 but thankfully as it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and the voters will shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9333649 the reaction from a large chunk of the audience boos
9333650 we expect this trend to continue through the end of the year with cases surging past 1 million by year end
9333651 not only are people losing jobs but those with jobs are increasingly likely to have their hours reduced to part time
9333652 this extraordinary destruction of wealth will have tremendous implications for millions of families
9333653 right now i hear people exclaiming with glee that they paid 3 39 for gas somewhere
9333654 people have to remember theyre still paying almost a dollar more than they were last year so prices are still extraordinarily high
9333655 were going to have to do a lot more if were going to significantly reduce our use of oil
9333656 i would assume something would come forward sooner rather than later
9333657 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
9333658 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost
9333659 i paid the bills whether i ate or didnt whether i went to the doctor or not
9333660 id go to bed and all i had on my mind was bankruptcy
9333661 you have to cry and try and figure out what in the world could i do
9333662 we havent had a single student turned down for a loan
9333663 is that the college financial aid offices are themselves sort of reeling from various lenders dropping out its difficult for the financial aid offices to keep pace let alone for parents to understand it
9333664 it got very political and a lot of people got caught in the crosshairs
9333665 john mccain is a guy with the kind of character we need in the white house
9333666 one of the things that the democrats talked about at their convention was hope and change john mccain by picking a washington outsider with executive experience has done just that
9333667 the idea that there is a wake left by a previous tropical cyclone if there is not the type of deep level warm water and proper overall pattern to recharge the environment is something i subscribe too i can list countless cases of this going on first of all any water left cooler in one place than another sets up a natural boundary that can effect the upward motion patterns that are in the field of play for the hurricane secondly if a shadow of cooler water is left in the wake of the storm why not again assuming a cooler than normal water temp below is there not one left in the atmosphere
9333668 the best thing the delegates could do to ensure that the party continues to grow is to focus on non divisive issues
9333669 social conservatives are and will be highly skeptical of charlie crist
9333670 charlie crist is first and foremost a pragmatist and that means that the issues he pushes or advocate will change depending on what the circumstances are
9333671 i do think theres a risk to crist being seen as trying to appease the extreme wing of his party
9333672 people like the live and let live guy theyre not really fond of someone who will go whichever way he thinks the political wind is blowing
9333673 the party platform across the board is a conservative document
9333674 it embodies social conservative views social conservatives are the heartbeat of the party
9333675 the republican party as a whole not only in the state but nationally has to decide if its going to be exclusive or inclusive
9333676 it will play out in this election if those who differ from the far far right conservative planks of the platform are made to feel as if they are unloved and unwanted i think theyll stay home
9333677 illustrates that he understands or at least the people around him understand that social conservatives are an important part of his base and its time to start sending the message that they matter
9333678 but im not at all convinced that the next three picks will be as strong as charles canady
9333679 an attempt to shore up his base and pander to the extreme right
9333680 i dont think people of any political persuasion like to feel as though theyre being told what they want to hear
9333681 it may be a situation that today social conservatives may not be at the head table of the republican party but were still in the same room
9333682 anybody who is a good thinking logical person knows if were going to win anything weve got to do that
9333683 if the storm doesnt come our way i will be leaving this afternoon
9333684 im looking forward to attending the convention and looking forward to getting sen mccain and his pick for a running mate elected to the white house
9333685 strictly politically i dont think he could have done better her background is that of an all american mother strategically putting a female on the ballot creates consternation among the undecided democrats that are out there because there is a place for all of the hillary clinton supporters to go when they didnt have a place on the barack obama joe biden ticket
9333686 its going to be an exciting week all the pageantry and whatnot
9333687 and were going to be able to contrast the candidates
9333688 its an important time in our countrys history and its a big event
9333689 i thought it was a home run he hit it out of the park shes a perfect complement to his personality and experience and she balances the ticket perfectly
9333690 we want to focus on helping bridge the gap of u s vehicles traveling to the iss international space station as efficiently as possible
9333691 the e mail is premature the parameters of the study have not yet been defined
9333692 i never thought in a million years that i was ever going to have a problem with working and making money
9333693 it was either pay one bill or pay another or not eat or not have a roof over my head
9333694 hes had a lot of problems paying his loans back and hes spent an awful lot of time out there talking about his problems rather than trying to pay his loans back
9333695 the cases are so harsh in measuring what an undue hardship is that anybody who is working and maintaining any kind of home life has very little chance of discharging these things in bankruptcy
9333696 at the time that people graduate from school almost everybody is technically eligible for bankruptcy because they have debts that exceed their assets
9333697 why would anyone lend you money if you had the option to walk away
9333698 what wed like to see is that people who have made a good faith effort to repay their student loans but for whatever reasons have hit a hard patch or hit a difficult stretch that there be some flexibility

9333700 la cosa pi vicina a un capolavoro che abbia mai pensato di realizzare
9333701 double cross the explosive inside story of the mobster who controlled america
9333702 the white house has confirmed the speculation that president bush is unlikely to go to the rnc convo they are working on alternative plans but dont have anything to announce yet expect
9333703 genera mucho ruido y discusi n pero estamos muy contentos con que se est discutiendo sobre la educaci n de nuestros adolescentes
9333704 weve been working toward this since february when you know youre going to play in the dallas cowboys backyard theres motivation there its a huge disappointment but a huge learning tool too
9333705 we went out there and tried to make big plays
9333706 we got a sack on the first play of the game and set the tone
9333707 in the first half turnovers and penalties hurt us but in the second half we came out ready to run the ball
9333708 thats who we did this for hes been here all this time and it feels good to get him his first win as a head coach
9333709 c un posto in nessun problema vieno con noi ci fa piacere
9333710 it hurts to see that we had the game right there
9333711 i was thinking we were going to score to win the game instead it slipped away
9333712 we just managed to have enough guys who wanted to make the big play and jump on those fumbles
9333713 i knew that the pearland tournament is nationally known and there are so many good teams there
9333714 so i knew we would get some really great games in and it would be good for our girls
9333715 and that is what we did every team we played was much taller than us but our defense was great through the tournament
9333716 we faced some really tough teams and i think that is exactly what we needed to do to start preparing now
9333717 our district is going to be really hard but i am happy about that because you cant get those tough game experiences in practice
9333718 you have to get those by being out there playing those great teams that is why we played in this tournament and why i think our district will be good for us
9333719 we knew we had the speed on them but we didnt think our drives would go that quickly
9333720 our coaches did a great job preparing all week and we executed
9333721 vernon caldwell played great at quarterback for us and our defense beat them at the point of attack and stopped their power game
9333722 i was just focused on giving my daddy a good birthday today
9333723 he flew all the way out here to ohio for the game so i wanted to make it worth it
9333724 we moved the ball in spurts but when you play a good team like that you have to score it was a good experience to play in this event and well get better
9333725 the people who were showing us around told me we were one of the best groups to come through with the way we conducted ourselves
9333726 i really built up the ohio versus texas element ill take the blame for that i think there are five states that have really great high school football ohio pennsylvania california florida and texas were excited to be here its a trip of a lifetime for these kids
9333727 its about making sure other people think and do the same things i believe in thats whats going to make this country a better place
9333728 sarah palin is an interesting choice for the gop while the democrats have nominated female candidates before this is certainly a first for the republicans i look forward to her debate with joe biden and his decades of national experience
9333729 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
9333730 lord have mercy i cant give you cyanide to kill your husband thats against the law ill lose my license theyll throw both of us in jail all kinds of bad things will happen absolutely not you cannot have any cyanide

9333756 these events inspire and empower young people to look at themselves what kind of future they want to build and how to get there villagepro was launched by student village as a result of the ongoing feedback we get from graduate recruiters around the lack of soft skills among new entrants to the workplace its working brilliantly

9333768 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
9333769 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
9333770 its such a disappointing loss and the players are hurting right now i think this is a real special team though you can say the positive situation is that we played against a sec school and played them really tough we gave it all we had and played them to the wire
9333771 we only came here for one reason to win and that just didnt happen this was just game one though and we have to turn this into a positive our thought now is to come back and get victory number one at hanson field

9333777 this was probably due to aerosols in the stratosphere spewed by the august 7th eruption of the in the aleutian islands
9333778 it would appear that bryans may be taking part in unofficial discussions
9333779 bryans idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world
9333780 i am not sure that this is a very desirable point of view to publish at the present time
9333781 bryans is a talkative and indiscreet fellow who is in possession of a story which he delights in telling and which if told publicly would be likely to cause embarrassment to the foreign office
9333782 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities afforded him to go to italy
9333783 it occurs to me that this is a possible means of putting deception over to the enemy by the careful framing of the questionnaires as presumably the germans must if they capture some of these birds take notice of the type of question which is being asked
9333784 we basically have the rest of sunday to complete the evacuation of the coast of louisiana as well as evacuation activities in texas and mississippi
9333785 he is fully committed to throwing all federal assets into this fight
9333786 that strikes me as exceptionally foolish people should heed the instructions to evacuate and protect their own lives
9333787 every area where the storm passed is reporting damage to homes and public buildings
9333788 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9333789 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation

9333794 we scored four goals conceded none and had no cards issued to our players we managed to play all of our players this evening
9333795 we need to keep our feet on the ground and continue to work each day
9333796 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9333797 do here also in your home town the things we have heard were done at capernaum
9333798 i am not afraid but i am concerned about chaos in the nation
9333799 we cannot let the seizure of government house continue indefinitely without taking action
9333800 all services at the airport are back to normal protesters started leaving the airport there are not many left now
9333801 krabi airport resumed normal service since early sunday morning the first flight from bangkok has landed there are no protesters left since the morning
9333802 there would be no excuse for them not to reduce their rates
9333803 weve always got an open mind to further enhancements to competition in the banking sector and well look at those over time
9333804 as the credit squeeze eases if it continues to ease then those reductions in the wholesale credit costs should also be passed on
9333805 how steeply is it slowing is it going to be a hard landing a soft landing
9333806 the governor did nothing wrong and has nothing to hide
9333807 its outrageous that the obama campaign is trying to attack her over a family issue as a reformer and a leader on ethics reform she has been happy to help out in the investigation of this matter because she was never directly involved
9333808 i think it raises the profile but it doesnt really change the mission or the work
9333809 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
9333810 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
9333811 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9333812 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
9333813 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9333814 its a wild gamble undertaken by our oldest ever first time candidate for president in hopes of changing the board of this election campaign maybe it will work but maybe and at least as likely it will reinforce a theme that id be pounding home if i were the obama campaign that its john mccain for all his white hair who represents the risky choice while it is barack obama who offers cautious steady predictable governance
9333815 i think this is the biggest political gamble just about in all of american history
9333816 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration
9333817 it was a genuinely outstanding speech it was magnificent it is the finest and i saw cuomos speech i saw kennedy in 80 i even saw douglas macarthur i saw martin luther king this is the greatest convention speech and probably the most important because unlike cuomo and the others this is an acceptance speech this came out of the heart of america and he went right at the heart of america
9333818 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9333819 what a historic night the first time an actual black person is leading the charge for a major american political party i think that says something pretty great about america we will accept a black man to lead us if the only other choice is a woman
9333820 john mccains vp pick is the governor of alaska a unknown hockey mom named sarah palin that no one ever heard of the only other job she had in politics was the mayor of a small town known as wasilla alaska and now she has the opportunity to be on a ticket opposite of barack obama the first black man shes ever seen
9333821 this isnt a presidential ticket this is a sitcom the maverick and the milf
9333822 are you kidding me the mayor of wasilla alaska yeah thats who you want in the white house during a time of crisis when she got a phone call at 3 in the morning it was because a moose had gotten in the garbage can
9333823 i think this is pertinent because mccain has been running this campaign based on were at war its a dangerous world out there
9333824 when they were vetting her for this job like three seconds ago she said quote im not making this up what is it exactly that the vp does every day let me field that for you sarah they start wars they enrich their friends they subvert the constitution and they shoot people in the face thats what the vice president does
9333825 shes not bad looking she looks like one of those women in the van halen videos who takes off her glasses shakes out her hair and then all of a sudden shes in high heels and a bikini all of a sudden i am for drilling in alaska

9333831 our life is what our thoughts make it a man will find that as he alters his thoughts toward things and other people things and other people will alter towards him
9333832 you cannot escape the results of your thoughts whatever your present environment may be you will fall remain or rise with your thoughts your vision your ideal you will become as small as your controlling desire as great as your dominant aspiration
9333833 the universe is change our life is what our thoughts make it
9333834 waste no more time talking about great souls and how they should be become one yourself
9333835 choose a life that is most useful and habit will make it the most agreeable
9333836 the secret of joy in work is contained in one word excellence to know how to do something well is to enjoy it
9333837 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thoughts with our thoughts we make the world
9333838 remember that fear always lurks behind perfectionism confronting your fears and allowing yourself the right to be human can paradoxically make you a far happier and more productive person
9333839 aim for success not perfection never give up your right to be wrong because then you will lose the ability to learn new things and move forward with your life

9333850 weve discussed our carbon footprint and it is something we are going to think about in the future
9333851 its worrying to see how much waste is left over at gigs and festivals it does make you think
9333852 itll be out some time in november and we might be back on tour in november or even october who knows
9333853 there have been significant changes in perception of john mccain in the two days of polling since he named alaska governor sarah palin as his running mate since then 49 of republicans voice a very favorable opinion of mccain thats up six percentage points from 43 just before the announcement also 64 of unaffiliated voters now give positive reviews to mccain up ten points since naming his running mate
9333854 he wants to do something service oriented if and when the storm hits and its as bad as its expected to be now
9333855 lets go to bobby jindal live from new orleans bobby can you hear us

9333858 they were off running the country trying to save people from a storm isnt that what you folks want them to do
9333859 palins selection was announced friday and that her strong anti abortion credentials have helped energize conservatives especially conservative women
9333860 this is a nice gesture although it will not doubt be lambasted as a jaded political stunt by the dems and their media arm
9333861 oh yeah we should definitely do it this way because it will totally make as look like the party that cares about poor people
9333862 we have discovered that honeybees are suffering from a brain chemistry disorder
9333863 our new drug buzzalin has been clinically shown to control the symptoms of colony collapse disorder while causing no more than two percent of the bees to commit suicide
9333864 up to 80 percent of honeybees may currently suffer from symptoms of colony collapse disorder and not even know it
9333865 we need to set up screening and treatment centers to get these bees the medicine they need no bee should be left untreated
9333866 no brain is too small to understand the need for psychiatric medicine
9333867 even if they make it out to the flower and collect some pollen they sort of crash land back in the hive like a damaged fighter jet on an aircraft carrier spilling their pollen granules all over the inside of the hive and getting their wings stuck in the honey
9333868 our goal is to end honeybesity by making beekeepers pay the highest prices in the world for buzzalin
9333869 well then take the profits from those sales and pay huge bonuses to our shareholders and ceos whatevers left will be invested in the search for a cure for honeybesity
9333870 insects appear to be the next great frontier in pharmaceutical profits
9333871 we see huge market opportunites in honeybees spiders ants and bed mites of course we will also pursue new opportunities for drugging human infants and newborns but the real growth in selling drugs will be found in turning insects into patients
9333872 im a 5th year senior i know what im doing and ive got something to prove

9333884 the ordinary man is passive within a narrow circle home life and perhaps the trade unions or local politics he feels himself master of his fate but otherwise he simply lies down and lets things happen to him
9333885 i dont think youre wild enough i think youre reckless

9333891 the spread of evil is the symptom of a vacuum whenever evil wins it is only by default by the moral failure of those who evade the fact that there can be no compromise on basic principles
9333892 in religion and politics peoples beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second hand and without examination
9333893 we have to make sure the focus is on the south on gustav make sure that all of the resources are there and that anything that is done with regard to the convention doesnt take anything away from that and is done in a serious way
9333894 senator mccain has already indicated that it would be inappropriate to have celebrations that things have to be scaled back
9333895 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9333896 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9333897 because shes a reformer and she thinks outside the box the way my husband does
9333898 you know washington is just a quagmire its a mess right now and both of them have been serious reformers
9333899 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here its also about making decisions and be targeted in what she thinks she has a great mind and she has a very serious direction in where she goes
9333900 the take home message is that a patient with mastitis does not necessarily need an antibiotic against mrsa
9333901 she will improve with a less specific antibiotic as long as she also empties her breasts either through feeding or pumping and if theres an abscess gets it treated
9333902 the physician can take the time to test the patient to determine what kind of bacteria she has
9333903 we found that youre not going to put the patient at a disadvantage if you start her on antibiotics while you wait for culture results then switch her to more powerful medication if she has mrsa
9333904 women should seek medical care if they have any symptoms or concerns for breast infections
9333905 this is a substantial breakthrough in maternal fetal medicine that could positively impact the health of thousands of babies
9333906 after 10 years of studying the effects of magnesium sulfate it has proven to be a successful method of reducing the outcome of cerebral palsy in premature births
9333907 based on results of the study in the future it is possible that women at risk of prematurely giving birth could proactively receive magnesium sulfate to reduce their childs chances of developing cerebral palsy
9333908 with additional research it is possible that in the next few years this will be a standard of care
9333909 the confines of the morning play that make up the world in all its splendour painting the sky with a stark sleek embarrassment where the trespassers traipse through the day the journey is nought but the inconvenience washed away the morning grace the sun washed not the image away they saved it for another day

9333950 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9333951 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9333952 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9333953 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9333954 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9333955 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9333956 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9333957 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9333958 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9333959 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9333960 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9333961 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9333962 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9333963 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9333964 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese

9333969 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9333970 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9333971 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono

9333985 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9333990 in queste ultime settimane ha detto ratzinger al termine della recita dell angelus dal palazzo apostolico di castel gandolfo la cronaca ha registrato laumento degli episodi di immigrazione irregolare dallafrica
9333991 non di rado la traversata del mediterraneo verso il continente europeo visto come un approdo di speranza per sfuggire a situazioni avverse e spesso insostenibili si trasforma in tragedia quella avvenuta qualche giorno ha aggiunto il papa ricordando i recenti casi di sbarco di clandestini che hanno prodotto numerosi morti fa sembra aver superato le precedenti per lalto numero di vittime la migrazione fenomeno presente fin dagli albori della storia dellumanit che da sempre pertanto ha caratterizzato le relazioni tra popoli e nazioni
9333992 lemergenza in cui si trasformata nei nostri tempi tuttavia ci interpella e mentre sollecita la nostra solidariet impone nello stesso tempo efficaci risposte politiche so che molte istanze regionali nazionali e internazionali si stanno occupando della questione della migrazione irregolare ad esse va il mio plauso e il mio incoraggiamento affinch continuino la loro meritevole azione con senso di responsabilit e spirito umanitario
9333993 senso di responsabilit devono mostrare anche i paesi di origine non solo perch si tratta di loro concittadini ha aggiunto benedetto xvi ma anche per rimuovere le cause di migrazione irregolare come pure per stroncare alle radici tutte le forme di criminalit ad essa collegate dal canto loro i paesi europei e comunque quelli meta di immigrazione sono tra laltro chiamati a sviluppare di comune accordo iniziative e strutture sempre pi adeguate alle necessit dei migranti irregolari questi ultimi poi vanno pure sensibilizzati sul valore della propria vita che rappresenta un bene unico sempre prezioso da tutelare di fronte ai gravissimi rischi a cui si espongono nella ricerca di un miglioramento delle loro condizioni e sul dovere della legalit che si impone a tutti
9333994 come padre comune sento il profondo dovere di richiamare lattenzione di tutti sul problema e di chiedere la generosa collaborazione di singoli e di istituzioni per affrontarlo e trovare vie di soluzione il signore ha concluso benedetto xvi ci accompagni e renda fecondi i nostri sforzi

9334007 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale

9334095 the experience that she comes from is what shes done in the government
9334096 its a republican convention yet the republican brand is not that good
9334097 i think its kind of more that they know who they are
9334098 there are a lot of things in the industry that have improved since the 04 and 05 seasons but at the end of the day its going to be a question of how destructive storms are and how powerful they are when they go through the gulf
9334099 they made it very clear that this storm could be as bad as it gets
9334100 we could see flooding even worse than we saw in hurricane katrina
9334101 chinas plans indicate its key role in new nuclear build and the impact of just a small element of its projects being realised would have major implications for new nuclear build capacity and the many constraints
9334102 aw gary why ya gotta treat me like that i really like matt if its not obvious
9334103 when he made that ditzy pick of the unknown and untested sarah palin as his vp against our advice we thought his political career was over
9334104 but the press went wild giving john kudos and calling him a maverick all over again so we will now milk that maverick pony all the way to the white house
9334105 then mccain will put brush back onto one of his properties and when mccain goes out hunting with a buddy he wont be like cheney who shot his friend instead mccain will shoot himself in the face
9334106 it may not be as good as an all out knock down drag out fight between hillary and barack
9334107 but now that its anything can happen day with mccain that should prove to have great entertainment value
9334108 and on day one i will name a pony to my cabinet and bomb the heck out of england now thats a maverick for you
9334109 bill read got up in the middle of that interrupted it and said theyve just upped the category to a category 5 storm that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the golf coast to really pay attention
9334110 its discrimination against the state of alaska during a time when gas prices are high and we need to look at all options to issue something that shuts off a viable resource
9334111 the amazing thing about this litigation is that the governor of alaska is so anti environmental that she is suing the bush administration over a claimed overabundance of protections for the polar bear
9334112 i think it shows the strength of our legal theory
9334113 basically we said list the polar bear and when you list the polar bear youre going to have to do something about greenhouse gas emissions the fact all these other parties are suing over it shows the bush administration doesnt have a legal leg to stand on they know the administration has to do something about greenhouse gas emissions
9334114 the cause for the search warrant is not public at this time
9334115 the convergence center is simply a gathering place and is not used for illegal actions it is a place for workshops and trainings
9334116 we are now accused of a simple fire code violation
9334117 just a space to get food free internet community organization
9334118 however the analysis is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made
9334119 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9334120 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
9334121 we are close to a serious conflict u s and nato preparations on a strategic scale are ongoing in the operation the west conducted on georgian soil against russia south ossetians were the victims or hostages of it we can see a rehearsal for an attack on iran
9334122 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
9334123 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
9334124 in light of the build up of nato naval forces in the black sea our fleet has also taken on the task of monitoring their activities
9334125 can nato indefinitely build up its forces and means there it turns out it cannot
9334126 if i leave georgia the russians will close our airspace and prevent me from returning home
9334127 could this be the reason why god gave us only 10 use of our brains

9334129 we took over 3 500 terrorists off the streets of baghdad in around 18 months
9334130 you could say it was a very successful period but the butchers bill was high the attrition rate is equivalent to that experienced by the sas during the malayan insurgency 50 years ago
9334131 the relationship between the sas and delta force is very close
9334132 if anything the attrition rate in delta force is higher two years ago the sas made a donation to delta forces widows and orphans fund of 10 000
9334133 there is no shoot to kill policy in iraq but there are only a few ways of stopping a suicide bomber a british lawyer is present during the planning stages of every operation and our troops operate under british rules not american rules
9334134 they have helped immensely in baghdad they have done a phenomenal job
9334135 the unrestrained greed of the u s leadership is leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9334136 in case of any confrontation the fake regimes are the first to be eliminated
9334137 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9334138 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day
9334139 we could see flooding even worse than we saw in hurricane katrina
9334140 i wouldnt worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p m today or 8 a m tomorrow
9334141 when it comes to evacuation do it sooner rather than later
9334142 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9334143 this is very very serious and we need you to heed this warning
9334144 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9334145 he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9334146 president bush pledged the full support of the federal government
9334147 right now were just doing knock operations and suggesting that residents evacuate in case the hurricane hits
9334148 as we watch the hurricane well determine the necessity of more units and individual guard members going forward
9334149 well be calling them basically as we need them were getting a force built up as we watch the path of the storm
9334150 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining whos of presidential caliber
9334151 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9334152 it would be one thing if she had only been governor for a year and a half but prior to that she had not had major experience in public life
9334153 the fact that he would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes obama look like an elder statesman
9334154 not to belittle alaska but its different than the basket of issues you deal with in big dynamic states
9334155 heres a governor who may have served two years but her accomplishments are worth eight
9334156 shes got as much experience for being vice president as barack does to be president
9334157 if she had been around for two terms as governor or been a senator it would have been an incredible choice
9334158 who else could he have found who appealed to the conservative base and as someone who was a reformer
9334159 he took the wind out of perots sails and perot could have done even better
9334160 one has to hope for mccains sake that palin has been fully vetted
9334161 the next thing you have to ask yourself is it worrisome to have a gambler in the thats an important question
9334162 the authors quote four scholars attacking gov palins fitness for the office of vice president among them david kennedy is a maxed out obama donor joel goldstein is also an obama donor and
9334163 they were supposed to destroy them and they signed documents saying they destroyed them
9334164 we only know of the whereabouts of one for sure
9334165 the material that was supposed to be destroyed was already superseded and had been replaced
9334166 there is no risk to the security of the weapon system and no possibility of an inadvertent launch as a result of this being taken from the weapon facility
9334167 they are not obviously working missile alert duties until the investigation is complete
9334168 the male has been temporarily reassigned while its being investigated
9334169 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base
9334170 gives us confidence he will keep his pledges to voters regarding the kinds of justices he would nominate to the supreme court
9334171 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges shes the complete package
9334172 the question is how this will be received by a lot of rank and file evangelicals who are just americans struggling along going to their megachurches and care about values
9334173 i saw e mails from independent investigator stephen branchflower two days ago to the department of law saying its time to schedule a deposition of the governor her chief of staff and the attorney general who had some contact with the case
9334174 other issues with the public safety commission as to how he was doing his job
9334175 he tasered his 11 year old stepson he was observed drinking and getting into a squad car and he illegally shot a moose which doesnt sound like much but in alaska state troopers have wildlife authority
9334176 we are fully prepared to respond to the emergency situation

9334416 for those who want universal healthcare or to end the war in iraq we must have great patience and perseverance for this is a democracy not a dictatorship if it were a dictatorship we could have healthcare for all tomorrow but it is precisely the fact that all points of view are heard and respected that things take so long to move forward

9334453 i want to bring home to world leaders on this expedition the reality of what is now happening here in the arctic
9334454 the rate of change is clearly faster than nearly all the models predict which has huge implications for climate change and how to tackle it
9334455 that cost us valuable seconds and we failed to recover them entirely on the following test whaanga coast there are still three stages to come and we are 17 7 seconds behind the leader and 14 5s off second spot we havent yet said our last word though and we have no intention of giving up we will continue to push
9334456 we were aware that this was probably too big a gap to bridge in normal circumstances but we never gave up and our efforts ended up paying its becoming something of a tradition for the last day of this rally to produce nail biting finishes i am obviously delighted to have won this event which i really enjoy and which has taken me further clear at the top of the championship
9334457 im obviously thrilled to have finished on the podium here
9334458 its fantastic to have contributed to a one two finish for the team and to have played a part in what has turned out to be a big points haul for citroen im also delighted with the feeling i had here in new zealand i still lack experience of this terrain but i was able to see that i have made progress since last years visit my feeling with the c4 is improving all the time and my times are getting closer and closer to those of the top loose surface experts the bottom line of our weekend here could hardly be better
9334459 this is one of the biggest disappointments of my career but thats the way sport goes
9334460 i was confident i could drive at normal pace through that stage and win but it wasnt to be because we handed loeb victory
9334461 we have made some good steps this rally and i will take a lot away from it stated h
9334462 after our problems on friday i got this opportunity to drive at my own pace and it allowed me to try new things and set some great times along the way we threw away last years notes and made new ones for this rally and i think this also helped a lot it was great to set seven fastest stage times and also to finish ninth which meant we could score a point for the munchis team and help them in the championship
9334463 theres lots of emotions and family trauma involved by listening and being there you can do so much

9334496 this confirms what weve been seeing for a couple of decades in observational studies
9334497 there is a benefit of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for heart failure patients
9334498 there are few treatments we have in medicine that affect total mortality in patients
9334499 just a handful of treatments affect total mortality even a small move percentage wise is a very important effect
9334500 heart failure is a very high risk condition it is absolutely critical for patients whether it is a prescription medicine or modification of diet or a supplement that they consult their physician
9334501 the drug was well tolerated it indicates that heart failure in and of itself should not be reason to start a patient on a statin
9334502 but it closes it partly maybe another statin would have a benefit it definitely makes us question the benefit of statins in heart failure but it doesnt close the door completely

9334531 the take home message is that a patient with mastitis does not necessarily need an antibiotic against mrsa
9334532 she will improve with a less specific antibiotic as long as she also empties her breasts either through feeding or pumping and if theres an abscess gets it treated
9334533 the physician can take the time to test the patient to determine what kind of bacteria she has
9334534 we found that youre not going to put the patient at a disadvantage if you start her on antibiotics while you wait for culture results then switch her to more powerful medication if she has mrsa

9334545 the transcend study demonstrates the value of telmisartan in people who are unable to tolerate angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
9334546 although the benefit is of moderate size there is an impact on a range of outcomes including the composite of cardiovascular death myocardial infarction and strokes as well as cardiovascular hospitalizations given the large proportion of people who are unable to tolerate an ace inhibitor the use of telmisartan would be clinically important
9334547 the remarkable tolerability of telmisartan is emphasized by the fact that fewer individuals stop medication if they were receiving telmisartan compared to placebo
9334548 this is particularly noteworthy as all the individuals enrolled in the study were unable to tolerate an ace inhibitor which is a closely related class of agents

9334569 the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life
9334570 at some future period not very distant as measured by centuries the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace the savage races throughout the world
9334571 he will be able to compete successfully with his bigger brained and smaller jawed rival in a contest which is to be carried out on by thoughts and not by bites
9334572 so if the races of man are to survive it is ok for us to exterminate the lower races in order for the higher races to survive
9334573 im eliminating the competition in order for my offspring to survive might makes right but we are taught that this is wrong morals have always been taught to kids so we can eliminate this behavior out of them

9334576 apathy are you saying the new world order doesnt exist
9334577 is it hatefull to be against hitler his mass murder and those who put him in power
9334578 johnny you are the one who commits a hatefull act by claiming hitlers actions were somehow christian when hitler set about his pagan nazi movement to destroy christianity with an emphasys on the protestant christianity of germany and indeed all of europe post war the conspiracy counter reformation set all of protestant north east germany in the ussr for forced atheism
9334579 what brings you to this forum you came directly to this thread and dogmaticly disregard any and all evidence for a global flood there is a mountain of evidence for the flood that even the blind can see the universal chalk layer polystrate fossils pillow lava on mtn tops non confomities within the geo column rappid petrification the numerous fraudulent dating methods used yet carbon dating shows coal is young which is disregarded billions of years do not exist neither millions
9334580 the only ones dogmatically clinging to this fairy tale of pagan evolution are either those in the education field for obvious reasons or pagans themselves freemasons knights kabalist all other witches or roman catholics who will not accept the bible including genesis which does not support their pope they often call themselves atheist and call catholics christian as if they are an expert on christianity for them accepting genesis would mean becoming a protestant excommunication and being disowned by their family a high price to pay for standing up for the truth the truth is a divider
9334581 none of your dating works you cant prove that the earth is millions of years old you guys cant even get 2 test to give the same result bet still stands perform your own tests

9334583 sorry not true their are always resistant strains they survive and breed they were already immune same as a killer flu virus it will kill off a lot of people but not all the people why some are just immune from it and will most likely pass that on to their offspring but its not guaranteed now if a virus turned into a moue that would be different now wouldnt it

9334586 wow do i really need to address this again one no where on earth can you find the geological column in its exact geological order and second you date the order by the fossils found in the layer at the same time you date those fossils by which layer they were found in third most of the time the younger layers are on the bottom and the older layers are on top like on the continental shelfs
9334587 the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life
9334588 the more civilized so called caucasian races have beaten the turkish hollow in the struggle for existence looking to the world at no very distant date what an endless number of lower races has been eliminated by the higher civilized races throughout the world
9334589 i think we must admit that the only acceptable explanation is creation i know that this is anathema to physicists as it is to me but we must not reject a theory that we do not like if the experimental evidence supports it
9334590 now this professor is an advocate of the theory of evolution
9334591 i believe that you can feel the religious overtones in that statement concerning the theory of evolution you can also see that someone who has preached it with the great zeal of thisman has had his entire comprehension of the universe altered it is more than a science to this man it is his religion it has permeated his entirepersonality under the guise of intelligence
9334592 has now come to realize that the possibility of a cell coming into existence by chance is impossible
9334593 if it comes to a choice between believing in a creator and believing in a scientific impossibility i will believe the impossibility
9334594 stupid statement he is saying that over the eons as the eyes have evolved from one creature to the next theeyes have remained the same but the genetic information producing the eyes have changed he is saying that mutations produced thesame results but with different combinations of genes thats utterly ridiculous but it is typical of the desperate measures taken by the evolutionist tobe able to hold on to his god the theory of evolution
9334595 if the theory of evolution is true we should see organs in the human body for instance that were useful to the human during his evolution but that since have become useless
9334596 there are about 180 organs in the human body listed by evolutionists as being in this category they included things such as the appendix the thymus gland and the big toe
9334597 guess what else is part of the auto immune system
9334598 the truth is there are no organs that do not have a purpose if evolution really happened we should see them
9334599 we should also see organs being born that is organs that seeing strange organs developing in our bodies organs that have no use at the present but that will have a use sometime in the future but we do not because there are none this is still another instance of the proclamation of assumed processes processes that have no proof of ever having happened
9334600 imagine the first amphibian as he started to evolve a wing at first it would be just a stub having evolved from a useful forearm in the midst of its evolution it would become a useless stub being halfway between a forearm and a wing it would have no function while evolving thus it places a severe handicap on the creature obviously natural selection would not allow such a thing to take place genetics certainly disallows it so there is no way with reasonable thought thatit could have happened
9334601 lucy has massive v shaped jaws in contrast to man
9334602 to complicate matters further some researchers believe that the afarensis sample lucy is really a mixture of two separate species the most convincing evidence for this is based on characteristics of the knee and elbow joints
9334603 johanson himself originally described the fossils as homo a species of man but soon after changed his mind based on the assessment of his colleague tim white they now describe the bones as too ape like in the jaws teeth and skull to be considered homo yet also sufficiently distinct from other later australopithecines to warrant their own species
9334604 the term falls outside the usual naming conventions for early humans and is used in a general sense to describe the oldest modern people in europe the skeletons showed the same high forehead upright posture and slender gracile skeleton as modern humans
9334605 dont you find that very strange for someone who was a keen supporter of the abolition of the christian led slave trade
9334606 sadly this has happened nothing of course to do with evolution nor with natural selection as i clearly demonstrated previously but more to do with
9334607 wasnt it white supremists who forced the native american into western ways by replacing his culture forever with the forced feeding of christianity and the english language
9334608 so yes i would say that instinctively we do have morals until organised religion comes along and arrogantly attempts top force its
9334609 try asking any jew who was part of or whose relation was part of the holocaust whether they blame it on darwins laws of evolution or whether they blame it on a white supremist christian nutcase if any answer the former i would be truly amazed
9334610 by the way i have two grown up children both absolutely wonderful citizens and wonderful people no religion whatsoever was rammed down their throats nor was atheism by the way and they are both non religious now religion is a totally redundant concept by the way talking of morals isnt it great that crimes such as rape and murder are plummeting there is hope for all yet
9334611 well we dont need religion for that but it is obviously not working too well when we witness the greed of the
9334612 i also detect a lot of hatred towards catholics on these pages
9334613 is it hatefull to be against hitler his mass murder and those who put him in power
9334614 johnny you are the one who commits a hatefull act by claiming hitlers actions were somehow christian when hitler set about his pagan nazi movement to destroy christianity with an emphasys on the protestant christianity of germany and indeed all of europe post war the conspiracy counter reformation set all of protestant north east germany in the ussr for forced atheism
9334615 sure it does in darwins mind the races were not equal here in america blacks were thought of as being 3 4 human where do you think this idea came from youll probably say the bible but if you ever read it youll see your wrong that very thought came from darwinism darwin didnt bring or create racism he just made it socially acceptable darwin did list the races of man on a scale of evolution blacks and jews being on the bottom just above apes and monkeys
9334616 oh yes we can all agree that we are all the same now in this day and age but darwin didnt and you know it and you call me the dirty tricks guy darwin fully believed in the extermination of the lower races
9334617 the more civilized so called caucasian races have beaten the turkish hollow in the struggle for existence
9334618 darwin spoke of the gorilla and the negro as occupying evolutionary positions between the baboon and the civilized races of man so darwin was a racist also i claim no part of jehovah witnesss teachings thanx now can we get back to the point at hand where morals come from but you continue to push the racist agenda sorry the bible clearly teaches that all men of all races all come from the same source has there been racisism in the past yes will there continue to be racism in the future most assurdley is it taught in the bible no
9334619 sorry your misleading again we had wars but not genocide of a race the concept of the complete obliteration of a race did not come about untill after darwin
9334620 for one i am opposed to negro citizenship in any and every form i believe this government was made on the white basis i believe it was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever and i am in favor of confining citizenship to white men men of european birth and descent instead of conferring it upon negroes indians and other inferior races now i do not believe that the almighty ever intended the negro to be the equal of the white man if he did he has been a long time demonstrating the fact for thousands of years the negro has been a race upon the earth and during all that time in all latitudes and climates wherever he has wandered or been taken he has been inferior to the race which he has there met he belongs to an inferior race and must always occupy an inferior position
9334621 im not lying at all thats what he believed i already showed that just because you refuse to accept that is not my problem
9334622 so where do the morals for your community come from it sure isnt instinct your community is going to raise the children to follow there examples thus teaching the child morals you have 2 kids do they ever lie did you teach them to lie and if you didnt did you teach them that its wrong to lie and if you had to teach them that it was wrong you just proved my point morals are taught and learned not ingrained
9334623 treat others as you would want to be treated by them
9334624 im only going to post a little of your christian bashing here 1 hitler was catholic not christian 2 more bible believing christians were killed in the holocaust than jews 3 i used hitler as a good example of darwinism put into practice and yes i could post examples of what was said and by whom but i wont just for you what i will say is this would darwin approve of what happened probably not did he help bring it about with his ideas yes hitler believed in the superman a person high up on the evolutionary chart so survival of the fittest works just fine
9334625 ahh the master of misleading strikes again this and your rant infront of it does not explain where morals come from and dude with hovind and taxes a little search of this site will show you just how wrong that is maybe you should google aaron russos freedom from fascism here ill provide a link after watching this you might think twice about that
9334626 provide examples of christian slave traders sufficient to prove that the slave trade was
9334627 the break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider for it will intervene between man in a more civilised state as we may hope even than the caucasian and some ape as low as a baboon instead of as now between the negro or australian and the gorilla
9334628 your own quote belies the folly of your argument 150 years ago where are the great achievements of the black races when the white races were building great civilizations for thousands of years surely they should in all that time have come up with something more advanced than mud huts and selling their own kinfolk as slaves the worst oppressors of blacks have always been blacks perhaps the curse that god put on hams seed cainan after ham put his seed where it didnt belong carries some weight his seed have become the sort of men that servants would use as servants thus fulfilling what god said more than 4300 years ago there has always been slavery and there have been more white slaves than black the more productive slaves were slavs and hebrews you would call me a racist
9334629 please dont insult our intelligence by assuming we are as ignorant as you are
9334630 knowing where offenders like pedophiles are does not mean you know what they are doing
9334631 treating people like pieces of meat does not seem to represent an improvement in the system to me
9334632 many commentators anchor themselves in the familiar present and exploiting the latest fashion and a series of telling anecdotes merely tell people what is already happening
9334633 much of what we have to say with regard to both continuities and discontinuities does not have a conclusion or ending happy or otherwise because self evidently the future has not happened yet
9334634 likely to be employed to manage knowledge and support decision making across government and commercial sectors
9334635 the world would be better or at least no worse in the future than it is today
9334636 if you had a magic cap to say are you good to go that might be valuable
9334637 if you can demonstrate their cognition changes as well as gets slowed down in some way then it would be very useful to have a tool to assess this
9334638 having a little black box telling them they may not to be able to do what theyve been training for may not go over well as you could imagine
9334639 as it stands its pretty much the only game in town for trying to monitor brain status
9334640 in the grand scheme of brain machine interfaces this is a complete paradigm change
9334641 this idea opens up all kinds of possibilities for how we interact with devices its not just about giving instructions but about those devices assisting us in a common goal you know the goal the computer knows the goal and you work together to solve the task
9334642 the status quo of brain machine interfaces that are out there have static and fixed decoding algorithms which assume a person thinks one way for all time
9334643 we learn throughout our lives and come into different scenarios so you need to develop a paradigm that allows interaction and growth
9334644 my neural implant made me do it i mean sure i thought about crushing my boss with that 2 ton metallic robot arm but i had no idea my neural implant would take me so seriously

9334649 we learn throughout our lives and come into different scenarios so you need to develop a paradigm that allows interaction and growth
9334650 we think this dialogue with a goal is how we can make these systems evolve over time
9334651 we want these devices to grow with the user also we want users to be able to experience new scenarios and be able to control the device
9334652 its a clear demonstration of a methodology that will work in situations when other implementations would fall apart
9334653 encouraging the placement of rfids on young children even in this limited and questionable context can only have the unintended effect of acclimating them to being monitored by the government in other contexts and wherever they go as if it were perfectly normal and appropriate
9334654 the exact identity of the person or certain characteristics about the person can be determined through the use of this technology
9334655 this information is used to monitor the movement of the person through the store or other areas tracking information can be used to provide targeted advertising and to improve existing store systems and tracking systems
9334656 invisible tracking brings to mind science fiction inspired uses or even abuses such as unknowingly getting sprinkled with smart tag powder for big brother like monitoring
9334657 any entity which is radically smarter than human beings would also be very powerful
9334658 if we get something wrong you could imagine the consequences would involve the extinction of the human species
9334659 we want to preserve the best of what it is to be human and maybe even amplify that
9334660 we will begin to use science and technology not just to manage the world around us but to manage our own human biology as well
9334661 the changes will be faster and more profound than the very very slow changes that would occur over tens of thousands of years as a result of natural selection and biological evolution
9334662 the culmination of the merger of our biological thinking and existence with our technology resulting in a world that is still human but that transcends our biological roots
9334663 there will be no distinction post singularity between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality
9334664 we will increasingly become software entities if you go out enough decades
9334665 biology and health and medicine used to be hit or miss
9334666 it wasnt based on any coherent theory about how it works
9334667 nanotechnology will not just be used to reprogram but to transcend biology and go beyond its limitations by merging with non biological systems
9334668 if we rebuild biological systems with nanotechnology we can go beyond its limits
9334669 a more intelligent process will inherently outcompete one that is less intelligent making intelligence the most powerful force in the universe
9334670 any entity which is radically smarter than human beings would also be very powerful if we get something wrong you could imagine the consequences would involve the extinction of the human species
9334671 we want to preserve the best of what it is to be human and maybe even amplify that we will begin to use science and technology not just to manage the world around us but to manage our own human biology as well the changes will be faster and more profound than the very very slow changes that would occur over tens of thousands of years as a result of natural selection and biological evolution
9334672 maybe it will take eight years or 200 years it is very hard to predict
9334673 the culmination of the merger of our biological thinking and existence with our technology resulting in a world that is still human but that transcends our biological roots
9334674 there will be no distinction post singularity between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality
9334675 our brains are a million times slower than electronics we will increasingly become software entities if you go out enough decades
9334676 nanotechnology will not just be used to reprogram but to transcend biology and go beyond its limitations by merging with non biological systems if we rebuild biological systems with nanotechnology we can go beyond its limits

9334681 nxps objective as the manufacturer of mifare classic chips is to transparently update all systems integrators and operators of infrastructures which use mifare classic in a timely manner so that they can take the appropriate measures to upgrade the security of their systems
9334682 different installations have different security requirements however it is not conceivable that they all will have their security upgraded to the necessary level in a period of months until this paper is published these upgrades will take up to a number of years
9334683 the judge has ruled that publishing this scientific article falls under the principle of freedom of expression and that in a democratic society it is of great importance that the results of scientific research can be published
9334684 in the opinion of the university the evidence based results of this research must find their way into the public sphere in order to achieve societal significance
9334685 i think its crucial that its published in an academic conference where researchers can work on solutions
9334686 designed around the concept of understanding biological sensory structures through advanced characterization and emulating or transferring this knowledge to the creation of superior synthetic sensors
9334687 will impact dod and national security by developing a rational and predictive basis for doing biological research to combat bioterrorism maintain healthy personnel and discover new vaccines and medicines
9334688 will develop and demonstrate an extremely small less than 7 5 cm ultra lightweight less than 10 grams air vehicle system with the potential to perform indoor and outdoor military missions the program will explore novel bio inspired conventional and unconventional configurations to provide the warfighter with unprecedented capability for urban mission operations
9334689 will pursue an integrated approach to the object recognition pathway in the brain this fundamental biological research will be accomplished using methods intentionally geared toward computational and modeling approaches that are amenable to hardware and software based implementations
9334690 create technologies that allow the warfighter to maintain peak physical and cognitive performance despite the harsh battlefield environment
9334691 novel pharmaceuticals that enhance neural transmission nutraceuticals that promote neurogenesis cognitive training and devices such as transcranial magnetic stimulation
9334692 continuously available on demand mission level training for all forces at all echelons specifically the program is developing in areas of high military importance new kinds of cognitive training systems that include elements of human tutor interactions and the emotional involvement of computer games coupled with the feedback of combat training center learning
9334693 are helping transform neuroscience from a laboratory discipline to one that is doing advanced research to deliver revolutionary capabilities important to our warfighters

9334703 thanks to this generous grant we can work with experts in automatic speech recognition and in brain imaging at other universities to research a brain computer interface with applications in military medical and commercial settings
9334704 such a system would require extensive training for anyone using it to send and receive messages
9334705 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
9334706 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class
9334707 they are a prime target because theyve got money and theyve got a worry and you can combine those two and offer them a false sense of security which is exactly what this is

9334723 there is a clear attempt to subvert democracy by going to provinces and asking them to issue meaningless statements devoid of substance endorsing rupiah because he represents continuity what continuity we saw these tactics when frederick chiluba wanted to impose his third term upon our country when mwaanga together with other shameless charlatans were singing chilubas praises and supporting his third term fully knowing that it was immoral it was a cheat a deception a manipulation of our people it is also clear that those championing rupiahs succession bid are people who in one way or another did not get what they wanted from levy some of them like mwaanga and chitala were people levy had dismissed from his government we all know what arthur yoyo stands for we also all know what mwaanga stands for and why levy had sacked him from his government wasnt it because of lies and dishonesty are these people one can expect to be truly representing or championing the cause of levys legacy the presence of mwaanga chitala and other charlatans like them in rupiahs campaign team speaks volumes about what rupiah stands for and where they want to take the country its really not in the direction of levy and his legacy but in the direction they are all known for
9334724 the mmd should learn something from the usa democratic party those who will not be elected should realise that at the end of the day they are all members of the same party which will be pitted against opposition parties that are determined to get to state house those who will not be selected will do well to mobilise their supporters to rally behind the party candidate in order to further the interests of their party

9334726 a draw for me is a normal result because we had more chances but made mistakes in the final shot
9334727 i think we need to respect tottenham and the quality they have i dont think anyone in this room thinks that tottenham are nothing they put eight or nine players at the back and it is difficult to create
9334728 i told the players a draw is ok but we need to try to work the ball more if they make a mistake it is not a problem if we play high balls i win one time and lose eight
9334729 in the first half we were paying too much respect to our opponents maybe we were overawed by chelsea and the stadium in the second half that was a thing of the past and we managed to keep hold of the ball and our performance meant we deserved the point we got

9334739 what our players need to understand what our fans need to understand what everyone needs to understand its one game
9334740 i cannot remember us getting beat physically that bad in the past three years
9334741 we never established any kind of control in the game we are obviously not the ninth rated team in the country we just got physically whipped on both sides of the ball
9334742 the key was not letting them run the ball and we had to dominate the line of scrimmage when we had the ball
9334743 this was a great win for our team but this is just one game
9334744 we have to learn how to play consistently well enjoy this game for 24 hours and get ready to play the next team

9334753 we do not favour sanctions on the whole and only resort to them in extreme circumstances but if required we could pass the relevant legislation
9334754 any sanctions would hurt the european union first of all much more than russia
9334755 russia wants to be an equal partner but the partnership should not be the kind of partnership between the horseman and horse but of two equal individuals
9334756 the situation is very difficult and we must be firm on our position in offering a line defending of course territorial integrity of georgia
9334757 when russia has a grievance over an issue such as south ossetia it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force
9334758 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9334759 the dangerous spiral of violence over georgia must be stopped
9334760 we need a strong and sensible european role to allow a return to reason and responsibility
9334761 someone should first tell me what a sanction against russia could be
9334762 particularly in such a serious political situation it is necessary to show a bit of common sense
9334763 be careful what you wish for you may get it and he was getting it got it
9334764 has to be better than a month in the shelter
9334765 you two have no idea how hot you are and that ford stands out like a sore thumb you will be up to your a double q sorry maam with reporters grifters and well wishers ears err i mean the colonel is bending over backwards to keep you safe undisturbed and productive weve been told you folks are solving big problems and frankly were busting butt to give you the space to do it so id appreciate it if you would get with the program like now youre supposed to sneak back into ladds you cant do that by driving the equivalent of a brass band into the parking lot sorry if ive offended
9334766 corporal you have my permission to tell me any time to pull my head out of it and tell me to get with the program thanks
9334767 thought you might have slept in this morning or went to extra innings
9334768 oh come on hon youre an old married woman now youre supposed to be doing those sorts of things ill assume you both had fun and move on to less embarrassing things babies have to go back on mama we used all the stored provisions toddlers have been were a little moochy the middle ones are still afraid theyre going to an orphanage and the ls are sizing up everything in pants for an audition ive spoken to them about personal responsibility expectations and the results of such fun being diaper changing that seems to have put a cork in it
9334769 you know navy you sound just like an aunt i had whose favorite line was
9334770 frivolity aside we need to go over whats going to happen in the next few days today mass for you catholics some intro sessions about how vermont life has changed while youve been away and time to pay the piper you have to meet with your staff the banker broker and lawyer monday press conference some folks will be leaving for their new situations interviews with potential placements for all the youngsters tuesday we expect folks to begin dribbling out finalize arrangements for all those that have trouble making a decision wednesday ship out the rest thursday clean up ladds and return it to the owners for their ski season and christmas business lucky you kids came during when they normally close for their own holiday and vacation
9334771 yes they willingly put themselves out for the heros of new york
9334772 i dont know if im supposed to tell you or not i think everyone just assumed you knew
9334773 well navy you tell us and if were not supposed to know well pretend we dont john is very good at playing dumb and all women know how to fake it
9334774 no i meant playing dumb do you really think that blondes are that dumb it takes real smarts not to damage that frail male ego
9334775 ok here goes you kids are rich the law states that what you bring into the state is yours like finders keepers unless someone claims you stole it you bring it across the border its yours i heard that the three insulin trucks were valued at about a million ounces each each truck had about 23k daily doses thats enough in each truck to keep about 200 people alive for a year thats with out the white coats playing games we had an insulin shortage while the university fast tracked a production process thats why youll find pork the cheapest dish around and a live pig worth its weight in gold the rumor is that you kids personally saved all the diabetics in the state and gave the university needed time to get an industry going
9334776 well how does that make us rich sick people need medicine well give it to them
9334777 you want to insult sick people by telling them that they their families and their neighbors cant take care of their needs no in vermont everything is bought and paid for no handouts in this state were a proud people and you have to learn that quickly you insult a person and they will demand satisfaction
9334778 you kids need to pay attention over the next few days be careful what you say to who in vermont your word is your bond and people will listen very carefully to what you say now go be with your family theyll be waking up soon and will need reassurance that youre there for them
9334779 no my darling it tickles a little it is just gods way to ensure his angels he sends to earth get exactly what they need and that mommies know how important their role is
9334780 yes honey we all did that its part of the cycle of life god sends us here and eventually return to him
9334781 yes dear as you get older god will give you everything you need these included eventually youll find the man of your dreams like i found john and have your own family
9334782 honey you will always be my children im filling in for your all your real moms until you see them again and love isnt limited like a bag of cookies where one can run out love is different the more you give away the more you have to give away and the more you get back
9334783 so my real mommy is dead and with god then
9334784 i dont know for sure im just doing what my mom would want me to do im behaving as i think shed want me to if she shows up tomorrow ill be happy and i hope shell be pleased with all weve done if your mommy shows up i will be overjoyed for you sad to give you back like a favorite book you return to the library but rest assured if our moms are in heaven together then you and i will be substitutes for each other
9334785 so if i call you mommy we will both know what i mean
9334786 yes honey you can do what ever you feel you need to we are all in the same boat now that i see everyone is awake so shall we say the school prayer and get ready to face the days opportunities
9334787 or is it mommy miss marie or marie mommy miss
9334788 let us remember that we are in the holy presence of god
9334789 were a little off our politeness this morning your grace some of us have just woken up today
9334790 yes i did hear you all had a busy day dear young newly wed mrs i cant very well call you mrs dog now can i
9334791 even though i gather this fearsome fellow giving me the evil eye very protectively with the label under dog would be the new husband top and under so one would think that makes you mister and mrs dog
9334792 yes your grace my new wife is truly top dog shes a great morse coder and is many ways a unique woman since all of our families were unavailable to us since what we call church day we formed some substitute families our family name is alban after saint alban so im john alban shes marie alban the other families are benedict catherine demiana ernin felix genevieve hilda in addition in the shelter we had ten water tanks who we also named for saints the ninth one was blessed yvette the anchoress and saint zita the patroness of servants with keys and bread weve called on the protection of the lord through the patron saint of good shepherd school saint thomas aquinas and that got us here
9334793 well said under dog well said although if you remember whos the top through out your married life things will go much smoother right colonel
9334794 yes your grace i personally leave the command hat at the door works well
9334795 and you children of good shepherd school have certainly lived up to your name and all the people you brought with you are a gift for the lord that allowed you to practice what you were taught cant give a gift without having a recipient
9334796 yes your grace we invited each guest as we called them to join one of the eight families so that no one was left out mother superior always insisted that everyone be included each of us has gifts to share she used to say
9334797 no your grace the children made the trip with the aid of only one teacher brother kevin
9334798 yes i met brother kevin yesterday his order proposed him to head the capitol christian brothers academy as the auxiliary bishop of vermont i was happy to sign the approval i assume this is brother kevin wearing his new badge of office
9334799 arise son and tell me how you led these people to vermont
9334800 no your grace i was not the leader john was things were very chaotic and i became indisposed besides even on church day the young man had a natural gift for leadership i merely helped along the way my superior brother prefect had identified john as having special gifts while coming up through the grades the crisis just brought those gifts to the fore he is the reason we are here today
9334801 your grace what brother kevin is politely saying is that in school i was a giant pain in the a double q to all the sisters and brothers
9334802 well my child we certainly have something in common i hated school as well we will have to consult with brother kevin as he revamps school into something that serves the people going forward well have to ensure he omits the stuff that we both hated going thru it well id love to chat but i came on business and i have some others to visit later today have you been to mass lately
9334803 well bishop we were a little short on priests although we had the church building we prayed a lot and some sundays things were a little hectic we were in a war zone
9334804 i understand my child you do know that there is no sin if theres no priest available the churches in china regularly hold services with no priest the priests there are all imprisoned so some catholics practice their faith for decades without the sacraments i came today prepared to say mass for you if thats agreeable
9334805 i understood from the colonel that there would be considerable difficulty for you to get to the church again today yesterday the crowds gawking at you were huge hard to pray under a microscope if everyone was willing i thought wed bring the church here
9334806 your grace wed i know id love that i think all the classmates would as well but not everyone whos here is catholic
9334807 correction your grace two of the classmates died under my command on the way here a fact that i will regret for a long time
9334808 well under dog john the colonel will tell you that when doing dangerous work men do die we cant fathom the reasons but you have think that their work here was finished and they have returned to his house to live with him in peace and perfection
9334809 youre very young but when you reach my age youll see that not everything is your fault nor can you frustrate his plan now lets get to work monsignor will you set the relic there on the dais table john were you ever an alter boy
9334810 no your grace i promised my wife to get her to agree to marry me that id always tell the truth i got out of it because i thought it was dumb but to avoid a fight i told brother prefect that my mom worked hard and got up early every day to go to work it would not be fair to her to ask her to get up on the weekends to take me to my alter boy duties
9334811 i see colonel i think we have a politician in the making here
9334812 brother prefect called johns mom and confirmed that she was a working single mom and let it go at that where john was concerned brother prefect verified everything but he did see something special in john that special came out big time in this experience on church day john led the counter attack that saved us he was ahead of me the whole day
9334813 im not proud of that day i murdered my fellow man in church that day
9334814 my child you did what you felt was right and you saved so many people and when you get a little older we can discuss the aramaic derivation of the thou shalt not kill commandment you may be surprised to find out you didnt but lets get to mass and ill help you and everyone
9334815 just imitate the little ones they have this down pat
9334816 welcome to our church when i was a military chaplain church was wherever the troops were i was cross trained to do services in seven major religions and one non denominational anyone who wants an anglican baptist catholic jewish lutheran methodist or non denominational protestant service see me after the mass and well do it that taught me how much we have in common for those not catholic i cant offer you communion if youre interested in learning more my door is always open today we will celebrate the mass we believe it commemorates the last supper and that jesus is really here with us in that spirit we invite you to pray with us pray for the souls who are not with us but with our father in heaven pray in thanksgiving for another safe delivery of children from danger like the israelite from pharaoh and pray that we all live our lives in conformity with his plan for us one announcement as bishop i am allowed to grant general absolution i hereby forgive all sins since your last good confession relying on the gospel according to matthew i say to you for if you forgive men when they sin against you your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive men their sins your father will not forgive your sins for all sins that you wish forgiven they are so
9334817 my children my blessing to you be at peace you have done well
9334818 and go in peace and to love and serve the lord which in this case i think means to have breakfast
9334819 14th state annexed to make the unlucky 13 feel better
9334820 sarcasm it makes the world go around but its funnier in vermont
9334821 there are question marks to indicate queries exclamation marks to indicate emphasis and periods to indicate a statement but here in vermont we have the to indicate sarcasm
9334822 the spotted black and white cows you see here in vermont are called holstains
9334823 battleboro vermont where the required 5 of voters 400 odd folks in the town put a question on the ballot to succeed from the world
9334824 vermont where kids go trick or treating during a blizzard
9334825 the vermont department of libraries and the green mountain book award committee recommended everyone read dairy queen where a vermont farm girl names all the family cows after famous football players thats what passes for important here
9334826 people on the canadian border talk about going south to burlington for a week of fun in the sun
9334827 the local paper covers national and international headlines on quarter page but requires six pages for local grammar school sports
9334828 in barre its the law that all residents shall bathe every saturday night
9334829 and only in vermont is the word yep considered a complete sentence in a conversation
9334830 vermont has always had a culture of extreme sensitivity to the feelings of others before the bishop admonished me about the number of religions hes fluent in id have listed myobisms as the state religion that might sound crass but thats what i liked about our state your new home while other states limited my rights to your nose i could say what i want as long as i didnt hit you here in vermont since the breakdown of the united states we here in vermont have informally formalized the right of satisfaction you can be challenged for what you say so be careful not to intrude or offend
9334831 bombs went off across the country mostly on the eastern seaboard when washington dc and new york city were destroyed we lost our national currency without a long boring explanation money has no intrinsic value its worth only what you can exchange it for the vermont state government quickly moved to declare a return to constitutional money in a unique burst of wisdom they decided that the state government would use gold and silver to be money in any business it does it repealed all legal tender laws citizens are free to use whatever currency they feel is useful here and now you will find canadian dollars english pounds german marks italian lira and swiss francs are all used gold and silver bullion coins are also used finally bank checks and barter slips are very popular my bank the bank of bennington is called bob we have issued some paper notes called bobettes by some comedian they are in denominations of up to a tenth of an ounce and have serial numbers they are really warehouse receipts for gold held in our vault as a courtesy bob has accepted the role of clearing house for all the funds that result from your convoy
9334832 vermont wishes to be the switzerland of north america as such all taxes have been eliminated all government functions that are not directly related to keeping the peace have been eliminated vermont used to send more to washington dc then it received in benefits so that is one saving by eliminating everything not related to defense and peace that saved three quarters of the entire budget this was necessary because they could only focus on defense to pay for the government that was left import tariffs were imposed on everything brought into the state for other than personal use
9334833 because the government didnt want to have a lot of checkers the value is declared at the border
9334834 we want to ensure that everyone has a placement they are happy with please bear with us as we try to ensure the best result possible
9334835 i think youre trying to intimidate john and you should realize hes too dumb to be scared of you so when you two men get finished deciding who has the biggest set we can get down to whatever john twisted your shorts about
9334836 i think youre thinking is incomplete and passive youre not using marie correctly watch turning to marie marie name every refugee please
9334837 thank you marie should be interviewing every refugee for information someone may have seen or know something that she can get out of them before they all move on while they are in one place
9334838 your formulation on the bravo golfs is passive they could lay low until the heat is off and then get back into their evil business can you afford to watch that route for a year we need to induce them to act and nail them
9334839 no and youve made a mistake about me your draft john letter highlighted to me just how wrong you were everyone else got a choice and i got drafted that was wrong im really at heart just an very annoying school kid who has been thrust into a once in a lifetime situation reacted to it and got incredibly lucky i dont have the experience education experience and temperament to be a colonel giving orders to real men real combat soldiers that might get them killed even coming here i used everyone to help and still make mistakes im not that good yet i havent earned that position youve made a mistake right now i have some unique stuff you need fine i want to help but soon that value will age away and you wont want that annoying kid around maries math is of permanent value she can help for decades she educated and smart im just a kid at heart i think you should use me for the interim and then we should go our separate ways im an injineer at heart and i want build things i dont know what yet but i think thats my vocation i need school i need time to grow and mature i need time to be a husband to my wife a leader of my people and hopefully a father to my children pretending to be a colonel and having some magic skill isnt right so we need to get the bravo golfs and then you need to let me get on with my life
9334840 i think so unless you want to play games waiting trying to make me uncomfortable and nervous
9334841 im making a note for my file that that tactic doesnt work with you ill consider your offering and get back to you dismissed
9334842 top dog and under dog need to get back to the hall to help people adjust their expectations make it happen
9334843 the kid has stones and a natural feel for the i game hes absolutely correct we can not afford watch 95 for a year and we might be better off trying to actively lure the rats out hes probably right his value will probably age badly we talked about that earlier we can use the girl forever him im not so sure the girls should probably be doing the debriefs for us hes no politician but he probably pretty in tune on this figure hes been under the gun for more than a month hes learned to read and react fearlessly
9334844 yeah yeah youre impressed with him me too lets concede hes a cross between wayne and mcqueen hes presented us with two problems do we get active and if we do what do we do
9334845 we have to get active if we want to nip this opp for leadership my fear is that it morphs into something else
9334846 their communications relies on their book code for security and theres no active communication messages in one direction are just broadcast at a certain time and repeated later at two other times theres no conversation and the messages have no authenticators nothing that lets the receiver know its a valid message very amateurish the childrens coding scheme had the shift in every line you knew that lines were logically connected we can send each end a message to the north we send meet 6pm at exit 40 the south meet 8pm at exit 20 then your wet work boys nuke whoever shows up well have exposed our selves and that there code is blown but if they are amateurs we could cut off the head of a very dangerous snake
9334847 make it happen send me the papers ill brief old gold and the guv
9334848 yeah he was really quite right pretty impressive for just a kid makes me think weve been holding kids down for decades they could do more
9334849 hey dont forget us women too you evil men have been holding us down as well
9334850 get out of here tell pa that you need to be held down some more youre getting dangerous
9334851 tell top dog to interview all the refugees quick before they leave tell john his plan was accepted alert the ear holes to action stations im on my way back with work and call the nasty boy tell him the boss has a chore for him
9334852 i know i need marie no financial discussion should exclude the wife
9334853 calm yourself boy one of the ogns is bringing her and ears will be here shortly too hes everyones guardian just relax
9334854 no im dan striffler im your new accountant if youll have me your aunt thought she needed a little help
9334855 and sir if i must say your journey was most inspiring
9334856 well dont be too inspired we were lucky and people died along the way and you can knock off the sirs im just john
9334857 ok lets get started everyone know everyone ok thought so im the guardian top and under dog are the reps for the refugees navy your show
9334858 the refugees arrived outside of vermont with substantial assets that was anticipated so they were met by the broker the banker and the lawyer general armody took possession of those assets being an astute general he directed his men to bring them into the state via the new hampshire border thus triggering a lower tax bill some of the stuff was non tariffed as personal property so we have an accounting nightmare the broker took all the trailers to market brokers report
9334859 we are still in the process of liquidating the assets its a game to generate the best deal for our children its not a fire sale the insulin has been sold and i placed looking at his papers 4 7 million ounces on deposit at bob in the generals ad litum account at doc jenns direction we have allocated some of the antibiotics for the children who may have tb form their time in the shelter and the freed slave women who have acquired a social disease in their travels and travails i believe that was the original purpose intended we paid a tariff on that of 1 kilo ounces we are negotiating the sale of the remaining trailers as market conditions allow
9334860 somewhere between 400 and a 800 million ounces the titanium steel has no market because no one has any were in the process of conducting a vickery combinatorial round robin auction the highest bid wins but pays what the next bidder bid bidders can bid for all or part bidding continues until there are only two bidders the second lowest bid is the floor for the next round high bid winds but pays the lower price the second bid in this round was 86 million ounces i think that this will end by the end of the week in the neighborhood of 125 million ounces i must say this has been most exciting and my firm has charged the refugees nothing for the service
9334861 yeah and every ad we see form now on will tout that fact
9334862 and bob can verify that those funds are on deposit
9334863 and the accountant can verify that hes seen the statements
9334864 and i know you have been doing your imitation of a rug peddler how much did you make for the kids
9334865 why colonel ive been the perfect lady in all my negotiations
9334866 yeah i heard there was a screaming match with the tabloids where they were crying rape
9334867 it was an active negotiation i deposited 225 kilo ounces in the dogs joint account and gave the accountant receipt for contributions of 100 kilo ounces to the various churches that helped us the wedding cost very little
9334868 ok mrs top dog and mr under dog what do you want to do with all this wealth
9334869 well all the trucks arent mine certain trucks belong to the guests certain to the classmates can i impose on you dan to help us apportion them out
9334870 can each person have an account at your bank can we have an account for groups like classmates guests and rescued
9334871 and treat all the accounts as one big account for the purpose of costs like sub accounts
9334872 we will extend to all the accounts our best customer status of course if all the papers are correct
9334873 by close of business monday my office will have established each child and each group as a corporate entity well have the papers and numbers there tuesday morning
9334874 then well start immediately establishing the accounts relying on that promise
9334875 duplicate account statements to me accountant lawyer broker and navy
9334876 you my dear are going to check the checkers and see if there are any opportunities for doing good or earning money
9334877 so what do you want to do with all this wealth
9334878 well distribute it fairly im thinking half immediately and half when they turn 21 each group has some stuff that is theirs some stuff is to be shared among all of us itll be some tough accounting but thats what well do the first half can be used to defray their expenses and help where ever they land not every refugee that came with us is entitled to a share the nun and the college student come to mind but we didnt save them to strand them here so they will share in the refugee pool the guest pool will be what the guests recovered classmate pool what we stole the insulin should go all into the classmate pool but we wanted to donate that initially until navy talked sense into me so we divide that in some proportion suggestions
9334879 its a tough split 60 30 10 she closed her eyes for a long moment that gives each of the rescued about one thousand seven hundred thirty eight ounces in their account to start how does that work for a transition fund
9334880 thats about a years pay for a colonel thats a generous transition fund
9334881 how can we get 4 7 million ounces of gold for the insulin when there is only 140 million ounces on earth
9334882 with all due respect to the ladies in the room and you all that has done so much for us thats barbara streisand ok we got 4 million for the insulin i want to see it now
9334883 you cant very well want me to bring you all that gold
9334884 youll break the bank we dont have that much in the vault
9334885 so youre cheating me you dont have my 4 million
9334886 im with him i dont understand how you can answer him frankly since i have deposits in you bank im most interested in that answer
9334887 you and nine friends each deposit an ounce i lend that some of that ten ounces to some one elses at interest i cant give you your ounce i loaned it out
9334888 but you said i can demand my ounce any time you lied
9334889 no not really because you and your friends never ask for their ounces its all book keeping entries
9334890 john let it go for the moment im going to have a conversation with the guv on this one
9334891 so for the record the gold i have in the ford im not planning to deposit at bob
9334892 thanks marie can you teach me that mind control thing you do voodoo
9334893 classmates guests refugees and any one else we departed new york with a bunch of stuff some very smart people are converting that to funds for us it will be divided up fare and square each of you will be getting a bank account with your share since we brought a lot of stuff i cant tell you exactly what it is but the initial deposit will be enough to keep you warm and fed through the winter youll have to use it very wisely each of you needs to choose an option form among the many placements offered we have to split up in the coming weeks to survive some of you will have real jobs some chores and school some of the contubernium will go as a group some will split up its all good as you choose some of you for the first time in your life what you want to do in life remember our teachers and those who didnt make it are expecting us to reflect well upon them but ill always be there for you as your once upon a time speaker and as a member of this extended family thanks

9334911 la divulgazione dei nostri sport dama e scacchi uno degli aspetti di cui ogni damista scacchista dovrebbe farsene carico e secondo me un grande pregio che distingue il vero appassionato dal semplice spingitore di pezzi qualunque categoria di gioco esso sia

9334913 la parte reazionaria del discorso del comico lo sfott c una grande differenza fra il teatro sfott e il teatro di satira il teatro di satira sempre morale basti pensare al timore al panico che hanno avuto sempre i potenti davanti ai problemi della satira perch la satira in molti casi ha determinato la presa di coscienza della gente soprattutto delle classi inferiori ha fatto capire di avere il potere di ribaltare le situazioni di avere il coraggio quindi temuta qual la differenza che esiste fra fare satira e fare sfott allora posso dire a un giovane attento che giocare esclusivamente sulla pura caricatura legata a un personaggio anche a un uomo politico che grasso piccolo magro magari ha la gobba magari si intartaglia non realizza niente questo fa fare soltanto una risata fine a se stessa ma se non c la dimensione morale se tu attraverso la satira non riesci a far capire il significato opposto delle banalit dellovvio dellipocrisia soprattutto e della violenza che ogni potere esprime e porta addosso ai minori ebbene il tuo ridere vuoto proprio lo sghignazzo ventrale e non quello dello stomaco e dei polmoni

9334930 es inutil negar puesto que es imposible disimularlo que una gran parte de europa italia y francia y una gran parte de alemania por no mencionar otros pa ses est dominada por una red de sociedades secretas

9334935 al parecer las advertencias de jefferson y lindberg acerca del control privado de un banco central advertencias que aparecen a continuaci n han demostrado ser correctas
9334936 sinceramente creo que la banca es m s peligrosa que los ej rcitos permanentes y que el principio de gastar dinero que ser pagado con posterioridad bajo el nombre de financiaci n no es m s que estafar al futuro a gran escala
9334937 el uso de un banco central para crear per odos alternativos de inflaci n y deflaci n y por consiguiente privar al ciudadano de a pie de la posibilidad de obtener ingentes beneficios es algo practicado por los banqueros de mbito internaciones como si se tratar de una ciencia exacta

9334968 ich habe in einer langgezogenen linkskurve in der die letzten fahrzeuge w hrend des ersten durchgangs nur noch eine sehr schmale spur sauber gelassen haben an der hinterachse den grip verloren das auto kam sehr quer
9334969 obwohl ich noch versuchte den wagen durch vollgas zu stabilisieren drehten wir uns und touchierten die b schung auf der kurveninnenseite dabei wurden die k hler zerst rt als die warnlampen f r die l und wassertemperatur aufleuchteten hatte unsere rallye ein ende gefunden
9334970 der ausgang dieser rallye geh rt zu den gr ten entt uschungen meiner bisherigen karriere
9334971 als ich jari matti am streckenrand stehen sah wusste ich dass ich eigentlich nur noch ankommen muss um zu gewinnen
9334972 neun kilometer vor dem ziel stellte ich jedoch einen schleichenden plattfu hinten rechts fest keine ahnung wo und wann wir den reifen besch digt haben sollen kurz vor pr fungs ende drehten wir uns auch noch und verloren zus tzliche zeit es sollte einfach nicht sein
9334973 der ausgang dieser rallye geh rt zu den gr ten entt uschungen meiner bisherigen karriere
9334974 aber so ist es im sport manchmal unsere titelchancen haben sich damit nat rlich nicht verbessert noch jedoch ist nichts verloren wir geben nicht auf ich f r meinen teil wei dass ich hier h tte gewinnen k nnen was dich nicht umbringt macht dich nur h rter
9334975 mit diesem resultat haben wir nach dem zwischenstand vor der letzten echten wp nicht gerechnet
9334976 platz drei bei dieser rallye z hlt zu den gr ten entt uschungen die wir je hinnehmen mussten ich kann mir vorstellen wie bitter sich mikko hirvonen f hlen muss ebenso wie jari matti latvala lieferte er bei dieser anspruchsvollen rallye eine fantastische vorstellung ab beide haben bewiesen dass sie den kampf mit s bastien loeb aufnehmen k nnen wir lassen den kopf jetzt nicht h ngen sondern k mpfen weiter
9334977 vielleicht sind es tage wie dieser und rallyes wie der diesj hrige wm lauf in neuseeland die diesen sport so attraktiv und faszinierend machen
9334978 wir mussten zwar einen r ckschlag hinnehmen geben unsere ambitionen auf eine dritte konstrukteurs weltmeisterschaft in folge deswegen aber nicht auf noch stehen vier wm l ufe aus und dass im rallye sport alles m glich ist haben wir erst heute am eigenen leib erlebt
9334979 und ich kann nicht fassen dass ich agostinis rekord eingestellt habe er war eines meiner vorbilder daher ist es unglaublich wie er 68 siege geschafft zu haben ich musste ihm aber versprechen dass ich seine 122 wm siege und seine 15 titel nicht bertreffe
9334980 es stehen noch f nf rennen aus und ich werde in jedem einzelnen auf sieg fahren
9334981 aber f r unsere weltmeisterschaft ist das nat rlich sehr gut daher freue ich mich mit dem team wir haben jetzt 75 punkte vorsprung was eine ganze menge ist aber es stehen noch f nf rennen aus und ich werde in jedem einzelnen auf sieg fahren so mache ich das schon seit dem beginn meiner karriere
9334982 dass ich heute nicht so optimistisch wie in br nn war casey herausfordern zu k nnen aber diese frage hat sich dann ja er brigt ich habe trotzdem von anfang an gepusht denn es ist nicht mein ding auf einen zweiten platz zu fahren vielleicht w re es ja doch ein toller fight geworden ich war sehr schnell als ich einmal meinen rhythmus hatte
9334983 wollte ich gewinnen aber es war sehr schwierig valentino zu folgen ich h tte daf r ein zu hohes risiko eingehen m ssen aber da war mir ein sicheres podium nach so langer zeit lieber ich brauche schlie lich selbstvertrauen
9334984 die party die valentinos fans heute veranstaltet haben hat mich daran erinnert wie gerne ich selbst gewinne
9334985 dieser zweite platz ist aber auch fantastisch ich habe anfangs etwas boden verloren aber dann fand ich meinen rhythmus ich berholte pedrosa und begann zu pushen bis in die letzte runde dieser doppelsieg ist eine tolle sache vor allem nach all den problemen der vergangenen monate perfekt
9334986 ich bin mit dem ergebnis sehr zufrieden von der pole position auf platz eins zu fahren klingt vielleicht einfach aber wir wissen dass es das nicht ist timo musste seine volle leistung abgeben und die hat er gezeigt mattias ekstr m fuhr von platz sieben auf drei das ist auch eine meisterleistung sowohl seinerseits als auch vom team das eine gute strategie erm glicht hat wir k nnen rundum gl cklich sein wir wissen aber dass auch neun punkte vorsprung in der dtm drei rennen vor schluss sicherlich nicht viel bedeuten wir haben immerhin zwei fahrer in schlagdistanz zur meisterschaft was sehr gut ist
9334987 pole position schnellste rennrunde und der sieg einfach ein fantastischer tag heute jetzt k nnen wir kr ftig feiern und dann in den endspurt der saison mit den letzten drei rennen gehen ich bin mit ein bisschen bauchweh nach brands hatch gekommen weil es in den vergangenen beiden jahren nicht so lief ich habe jede menge datenanalysen gemacht und videos angeschaut um dieses wochenende alles hinzubekommen offenbar hat das geholfen und war heute ein schl ssel zum erfolg danke an audi und meine mechaniker von abt sportsline f r die tolle unterst tzung danke aber auch an die konkurrenz von mercedes die sich heute auf der strecke auch bei berrundungen absolut fair verhalten hat so macht motorsport richtig spa
9334988 ich bin nach brands hatch gekommen um das rennen zu gewinnen aber nach meinem getriebeschaden im qualifying musste ich meine ziele leider etwas revidieren vom siebten startplatz auf das podium zu fahren ist eine tolle sache mein a4 war im rennen stark ich konnte attackieren und berholen also bin ich am ende des tages mit dem ergebnis zufrieden der kampf um die meisterschaft ist noch nicht vorbei zwar sind zehn punkte r ckstand auf timo scheider eine menge aber in der dtm kann gerade in der dramatischen schlussphase der saison noch sehr viel passieren
9334989 letztes jahr hatte ich hier eine gute strategie erwischt diesmal lief es bei eki perfekt was nat rlich mit blick auf die meisterschaft wichtig ist ich hing nach meinen stopps jeweils hinter einem mercedes fest das war weniger gl cklich aber ich bin auch nicht v llig unzufrieden obwohl ich mir ein besseres ergebnis gew nscht h tte
9334990 beim letzten rennen stand ich auf pole hier musste ich von platz zw lf starten daher musste ich mit der richtigen mischung aus attacke und vorsicht zu werke gehen ich erwischte einen guten start w re au en fast an rocky und bernd schneider vorbei gekommen habe dann aber einen schlag bekommen und musste aufs gras ausweichen das hat mich drei positionen gekostet dann habe ich wieder attackiert und konnte drei autos auf der strecke berholen den rest habe ich aufgeholt dank einer guten strategie und der schnellen arbeit meiner jungs bei den stopps fast h tte ich noch spengler erwischt aber meine reifen waren schon zu zerschlissen
9334991 sicher kein einfaches rennen aber ich bin sehr zufrieden immerhin bin ich von platz 15 auf zehn vorgefahren das ist besser als ich erwartet hatte
9334992 beim start habe ich leider ein zwei pl tze verloren sp ter hing ich hinter alexandre pr mat fest mein auto war zwar schneller aber ich kam nicht vorbei daher war mein rennen eher unspektakul r
9334993 beim start machte ich einen platz gut aber in den folgenden runden konnten mich eki und jamie green berholen beim ersten stopp habe ich dann noch einen platz an gary paffett verloren der fr her an die box gekommen war beim versuch ihn zu attackieren bin ich kurz von der strecke abgekommen und weiter zur ckgefallen es war nicht mein tag
9334994 es h tte ein ganz gutes rennen werden k nnen leider hat ein missgl ckter stopp das verhindert schade
9334995 heute war unsere strategie nicht so super weshalb wir viele positionen verloren haben wir m ssen die daten analysieren um herauszufinden was genau falsch lief mit den boxenstopps hatten wir pech unser tempo war grunds tzlich nicht so schlecht denn ich habe noch zwei mercedes berholt das ergebnis war nicht gut genug im n chsten rennen wollen wir besser werden
9334996 leider lief das rennen schlecht wir haben einfach pech im zweiten und dritten sektor waren unsere zeiten ganz gut leider war der erste boxenstopp nicht sehr gut wir h tten uns unter den ersten zw lf bewegen k nnen wenn ich nicht zwei mal von mercedes fahrern getroffen worden w re da war ich machtlos
9334997 die fans haben ein sensationelles rennen mit allen facetten gesehen gratulation an timo er hat absolut keinen fehler gemacht auch martin und tom sind ein gutes rennen gefahren ein besonderes highlight war sicher mattias ekstr m der sich von platz sieben auf drei vorgek mpft hat ich kann mich nur bei meinem ganzen team f r diese super leistung bedanken nur wenn alle so fehlerlos zusammenarbeiten wie wir heute kann man soweit nach vorne fahren
9334998 super ergebnis f r audi mit platz eins und drei wir hatten uns f r oliver jarvis mehr erhofft als platz zw lf aber alexandre pr mat ist immerhin von 15 auf zehn vorgefahren unsere beiden autos sind im mittelfeld ins ziel gekommen unterm strich ein akzeptables ergebnis auch wenn mehr m glich gewesen w re
9334999 bei markus war das tempo gut leider hatte er keinen guten start erwischt und ein paar pl tze verloren die er nicht wieder aufholen konnte weil er hinter einem anderen auto h ngen blieb bei rocky ging beim ersten stopp ein gerade revidierter schlagschrauber kaputt es tut mir leid dass es mal wieder ihn getroffen hat

9335011 could not focus on anything this officer suggested he simply begged and pleaded with this officer to help him stay in this city so that he could make money for himself and his family the problem is that he never explained just how he was sending money to his mother as he claimed that he did not know her actual address and she has no phone

9335045 in its most basic form the process involves two steps see chart in step one a company with loans or other income producing assets the originator identifies the assets it wants to remove from its balance sheet and pools them into what is called the reference portfolio it then sells this asset pool to an issuer such as a special purpose vehicle spv an entity set up usually by a financial institution specifically to purchase the assets and realize their off balance sheet treatment for legal and accounting purposes in step two the issuer finances the acquisition of the pooled assets by issuing tradable interest bearing securities that are sold to capital market investors the investors receive fixed or floating rate payments from a trustee account funded by the cash flows generated by the reference portfolio in most cases the originator services the loans in the portfolio collects payments from the original borrowers and passes them on less a servicing fee directly to the spv or the trustee in essence securitization represents an alternative and diversified source of finance based on the transfer of credit risk and possibly also interest rate and currency risk from issuers to investors

9335055 we are ready for a fight to control the scientific high ground
9335056 youre looking at a half a per cent lower gdp growth in the first and second quarters which means there is more slack in the economy
9335057 the argument is when we think about it in very general terms the argument is that the case for sustained low interest rates is i think overwhelming
9335058 basically were looking at a broader based and probably more material global slowdown than people were thinking a month or two ago
9335059 i think youre seeing more softness abroad than people anticipated and youre looking at more of a policy response catching up to what the u s has done
9335060 the experience that she comes from is with what shes done in the government and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here

9335067 it is my opinion that father paquette should return as soon as possible to a parish setting and observe the signals of caution which we have discussed
9335068 despite the demands of two sets of irate parents that something be done about this father paquettes pastor and i are determined to take the risk of leaving him in his present assignment
9335069 our thinking is that knowing the awareness of others concerning his problem father paquette will have reason for self control
9335070 i do agree with your thinking i do not believe it is too risky to leave father paquette in his present assignment but of course can make no predictions
9335071 the situation had become so explosive that i had no other recourse but to ask father paquette to leave the parish immediately
9335072 from the perspective of sending a signal to moscow yes they want to send the hard liner out to the region

9335075 mr cheney has certainly been associated with the people who are hardest on the russians
9335076 any country that has a potential separatist movement will view the events in georgia through its own unique prism
9335077 but the greatest cause for concern lies in the ukraine azerbaijan and moldova all states that border russia
9335078 by illegally recognizing the georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia dmitry medvedev russias president made clear that moscows goal is to redraw the map of europe using force
9335079 we have our western friends and those in central asia who are not in agreement with russian actions but we also have a strong relationship with russia
9335080 the georgian conflict isnt likely to have a direct effect on the emergence of new separatist or secessionist movements but it has the potential to create a long term precedent
9335081 elective surgery has been abandoned in the central hospitals and even emergency surgery is often dependent on the ability of patients relatives to purchase suture materials from private suppliers
9335082 pharmacies stand empty and ambulances immobilized for want of spare parts this is an unmitigated tragedy scarcely conceivable just a year ago
9335083 the pharmacy may be empty and most equipment out of order but they will be striving to provide some sort of service

9335086 they think every tamil speaking person is a terrorist they want to control us
9335087 no one suggests for the moment that there should not be security measures and precautions
9335088 at the same time we need to be a lot more serious in finding the balance between democratic rights and human rights and the right security measures we cant alienate an entire community an entire section of the citizenry
9335089 the root cause of this is the unresolved ethnic issue

9335094 the prosecutor said it was then that they decided to drive around and look for victims who were coming out of new years celebrations
9335095 some woman dont participate in the dance because of these maidens who expose their private parts and this destroys the image of the celebration
9335096 we remain cautiously optimistic that the dialogue is going to be successfully concluded
9335097 this is why we feel as mdc we have to be committed to the success of the dialogue
9335098 the meeting was convened because the facilitator wanted to search for a way forward
9335099 of course the talks continue there isnt a timeframe and we are not going to be obliged to impose timeframes
9335100 for us the most important thing is that these talks must continue and we must find a solution its not a pr exercise we are not going to walk like beauty queens on a catwalk we have never done that its not in our nature
9335101 zanu pf dismissed the suggestion not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9335102 there is nothing coming out of those discussions they are just wasting time they should just go public and say that the talks have collapsed
9335103 if we did not have a system of classification that was hierarchical and had names that could be easily retrieved we would be helpless
9335104 splitters want to draw the lines around a specimen tightly while lumpers will say no thats just a slight variation and there is nothing in this system which tells you who is right it is purely subjective
9335105 if you want to preserve a vanishing species or combat a medically dangerous one or use it in some beneficial way as a crop you need to know what you are dealing with
9335106 that name is the key to all the knowledge that has been accumulated about that organism

9335131 what indian companies and workers bring to the table is definitely very good design and engineering skills as well as management skills
9335132 but these skills are complemented by what the chinese bring to the table
9335133 once you set the systems right and show them what you want they can achieve it in super fast time and you can work on the assumption that its going to work fine
9335134 that wouldnt happen here in india we wouldnt be able to complete a project as quickly as they are able to
9335135 theres no denying that china is cheaper than in india although it does depend what exactly youre looking for
9335136 the individual components can be cheaper by anywhere between 5 to 25 now thats not something to sneeze at
9335137 if you look at the cost of making a tractor around 70 of that is the raw material costs which are rising all the time
9335138 so finding a way to cut costs is one way to manage the higher raw material charges
9335139 i think one needs to have a bit of patience and largeness of heart
9335140 things are not always what they appear to be here in india were very process driven and we operate with very clear procedures

9335142 we thought that when women went out to the workplace then the division of work in the home would also automatically change that has not been the case women became economically independent but at the same time double working with many negative consequences
9335143 the weaker position of women in the workplace with regard to her pay health and pension is a collective and general problem a social contribution to remove the unpaid work from women would make her free to make her own decisions

9335151 nobody knew who i was the first couple months i was just enjoying friends i had in the neighborhood paying bills going to the grocery store and doing the simple things that arent so simple now
9335152 if i had to pick a moment when i turned a corner its when i retired pretty much before that my life was just going in a straight line i didnt feel like i really had control over what was happening i was just a football player thats all i ever knew when i retired the whole story had to be re written thats when everything became really fun
9335153 we had to look at it as a blank piece of paper and see where we were
9335154 hes made every workout and done extra in some of those situations hes been to every meeting and off season ota practice all i have to go on is what ive seen since ive been here the guys been really accountable
9335155 i would tell them if its meant for me to not let you down i wont let you down but if its meant for me to do something else then im sorry youre going to be let down
9335156 thats one thing ive tried to impress upon my kids life is not always going to be perfect youre going to be let down by even me sometimes you just have to try and understand and move on
9335157 by coming back and playing and leaving in a way that feels better to people there are positive associations
9335158 i dont feel im carrying that baggage for the rest of my life
9335159 as football players weve all had experiences that you dont want to repeat or look back on too much
9335160 i think it was helpful thats whats made him into what he is now the things you go through make you stronger as an individual
9335161 the way i look at it the people who have misconceptions about me have misconceptions about themselves
9335162 people who have had the experience ive had and been stuck there had to be some sort of crisis to break them out of the situation we all go through similar experiences but we all handle them a little differently
9335163 for me its definitely been a ride and its been wild but at the same time its been fun i always used to feel like i was trapped as a football player and there were things i would never be able to do in this lifetime ive had a chance to do 85 90 percent of those things and im still a football player

9335181 to florida gulf coasts credit they made use of last nights scrimmage and came out better prepared today
9335182 we came out and started the same lineup and tried to do the same thing but they changed the shape of their team and changed their personnel a little that made things difficult for us
9335183 in addition to that goal we created some good chances early in the match and had a chance to put them away early but we didnt do it
9335184 fortunately we got the penalty kick which was a good call and that was the difference
9335185 its a good start and were going to have to win our home games this year
9335186 every game is going to be difficult because of who we are and what were bringing to the table with last years success

9335190 the record clearly indicates a serious and concentrated pattern of unacceptable and at times illegal activity occurring over a lengthy period which establishes a course of conduct totally at odds with the ethics of our profession

9335193 the reason for the change is nothing to be alarmed by paper and production costs have presented us with a choice increase subscription rates and single issue costs to retain the old format or adopt a slightly different size and return our current prices the new size is called an l trim 5 7 8
9335194 it should be easy cheap and safe for any person to communicate their thoughts to the public
9335195 finish the game that s kind of been our off season
9335196 i think the game tonight sort of epitomized us being able to do that
9335197 i think the last drive with 12 minutes to go in the game in taking the air out of the ball for seven minutes is what you call finishing the game
9335198 he got tired and didn t play as fast as we d like him to at times but i think a lot of that has to do with anxiety i was pleased overall with the progress our freshman have made and the way that they played
9335199 he has a sprained knee i haven t talked to the doctors but i don t think it s anything too serious but we have to get you an update on monday
9335200 confidence can screw you up confidence can be a good thing but what our players need to understand what our fans need to understand what everybody needs to understand it s one game
9335201 it s one game and we need to keep playing better and we need to improve and our players need to have the focus to improve and remember how they got where they got rather than think we can just show up now and beat whoever we play because we have a tendency to think that way around here instead of just kicking people s ass like we re supposed to and working to do it
9335202 when you ask me those kind of questions a generic question about the win building confidence it really pisses me off

9335244 its a privilege and an honor to be in the white intellectual ghetto of the west we wanted to do a couple of things before we started the first is that based on the fact that sncc through the articulation of its program by its chairman has been able to win elections in georgia alabama maryland and by our appearance here will win an election in california in 1968 im going to run for president of the united states i just cant make it cause i wasnt born in the united states thats the only thing holding me back

9335246 the problem of caste then ultimately resolves itself into one of repairing the disparity between marriageable units of two sexes with in it left to nature the much needed parity between the units can be realized only when a couple dies simultaneously but this is rare contingency the husband may die before the wife and create a surplus woman who must be disposed of else through intermarriage she will violate the endogamy of man whom the group while it may sympathies with him for sad break the endogamy thus both the surplus man and surplus woman constitute a menace to the caste if not taken care of for not finding suitable partners inside their prescribed circle and left to themselves they cannot find any for it matter be not regulated there can only be just enough pairs to go round very likely they will transgress the boundary marry outside and import offspring that is foreign to caste
9335247 never regard yourself as untouchables live a clean life dress yourselves as touchable ladies never mind if your dress if full of patches but see that it is clean none can restrict your freedom in the choice of your garments attend more to the cultivation of the mind and spirit of self help
9335248 but do not feed in any case your spouse and sons if they are drunkards send your children to schools education is as necessary for females as it is for males if you know how to read and write there would be much progress as you are so your children will be
9335249 learn to be clean keep from vices give education to your children instill ambition into them inculcate in their minds that they are destined to be great remove from them all inferiority complexes
9335250 do not be in hurry to marry marriage is liability you should not impose it upon your children unless they are financially able to meet the liabilities arising from marriage those who will marry will have to keep in mind that to have too many children is a crime the paternal duty lies in giving each child a better start than its parents had above all let every girl who marries stand by her husband claim to be her husbands friend and equal and refuse to his slave i am sure if you follow this advice you will bring honour and glory to yourselves

9335264 was issued as propaganda through the office of war information
9335265 that the reaction of the japanese government was entirely different from what radio tokyo had reported
9335266 that the japanese government suspended judgment on the potsdam ultimatum
9335267 unconditional surrender the cost of japans homeland invasion and soviet entry into the war
9335268 because of the satisfaction that everything had gone as he had planned
9335269 did not lead to their decision to accept the potsdam terms but further contributed to their desperate efforts to terminate the war through moscows mediation indeed soviet attack not the hiroshima bomb convinced political leaders to end the war by accepting the potsdam declaration
9335270 needed japans refusal to justify the use of the atomic bomb thus he could not include the provision providing a constitutional monarchy
9335271 ironically both stalin and truman had vested interests in keeping unconditional surrender no monarchy for different reasons
9335272 would most likely not have prompted the japanese to surrender the war most likely would have ended shortly after soviet entry into the war before november 1
9335273 must bear the responsibility for the wars destructive end more than the american president and the soviet dictator

9335332 a silent communications system in which nonaural carriers in the very low or very high audio frequency range or in the adjacent ultrasonic frequency spectrum are amplitude or frequency modulated with the desired intelligence and propagated acoustically or vibrationally for inducement into the brain typically through the use of loudspeakers earphones or piezoelectric transducers the modulated carriers may be transmitted directly in real time or may be conveniently recorded and stored on mechanical magnetic or optical media for delayed or repeated transmission to the listener

9335339 hearing on radio frequency weapons and proliferation potential impact on the economy
9335340 during the cold war the united states not only engaged in a relatively open nuclear arms race with the soviet union but also engaged in a secret race developing unconventional weapons
9335341 and as the us intelligence community began to grow a secret culture sprang about which enabled the intelligence players to implement the various developed techniques to cleverly circumvent the democratic processes and institutions
9335342 like many other democracies the us government is made up of two basic parts the elected constituency i e the various governors judges congressmen and the president and the unelected bureaucracies as represented by the numerous federal agencies
9335343 in a well balanced and correctly functioning democracy the elected part of the government is in charge of its unelected bureaucratic part giving the people a real voice in the agenda set by their government
9335344 while a significant part of the us government no doubt follows this democratic principle a considerable portion of the us government operates in complete secrecy and follows its own unaccountable agenda which unacknowledged very often is quite different from the public agenda
9335345 we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions added to this three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defence establishment we annually spend on military security more than the net income of all united states corporations
9335346 this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the american experience
9335347 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or our democratic processes

9335351 on the possibility of directly accessing every human brain by electromagnetic induction of fundamental algorithms
9335352 contemporary neuroscience suggests the existence of fundamental algorithms by which all sensory transduction is translated into an intrinsic brain specific code direct stimulation of these codes within the human temporal or limbic cortices by applied electromagnetic patterns may require energy levels which are within the range of both geomagnetic activity and contemporary communication networks a process which is coupled to the narrow band of brain temperature could allow all normal human brains to be affected by a subharmonic whose frequency range at about 10 hz would only vary by 0 1 hz
9335353 within the last two decades a potential has emerged which was improbable but which is now marginally feasible
9335354 the historical emergence of such possibilities which have ranged from gunpowder to atomic fission have resulted in major changes in the social evolution that occurred inordinately quickly after the implementation reduction of the risk of the inappropriate application of these technologies requires the continued and open discussion of their realistic feasibility and implications within the scientific and public domain

9335371 minnesota is in the most competitive electoral arena in the country
9335372 holding the convention here allows them to in a sense re brand the republican party to push out the old product which was george bush and introduce a new product called john mccain and to really seize hold of the imagination of voters in the upper midwest and in minnesota
9335373 lets be frank if the convention were held in the first week of september in tampa which was one of the chief competitors to the twin cities how many minnesotans as the kids were going back to school and people were thinking about how to get the lake cabin shut down how much attention would they pay to the republican convention in tampa
9335374 putting up a good concentrated effort here in minnesota even if we fall slightly short if were forcing the democrats to fight real hard and expend resources to keep this state in their column that in itself is a victory for republicans and the broader republican cause
9335375 theres a lot of work ahead of us between now and november 4 but at the end of the day when people see senator obamas ideas to strengthen the economy theyre going to know that hes the person to move us forward and i think that will help us be successful here in minnesota

9335404 seful statului a vorbit duminica la telefon cu premierul italian silvio berlusconi pentru a continua consultarile cu liderii europeni pe tema situatiei din georgia
9335405 sanctiunile economice in privinta rusiei sunt dupa parere mea inutile nu vor exista sanctiuni economie vor exista sanctiuni moral politice
9335406 sanctiunile economice nu vor fi sustinute de marile state europene care in ultimii 20 de ani au construit relatii economice excelente cu rusia
9335407 mediul de afaceri care in ultimii 15 20 de ani a realizat mari profituri de pe urma colaborarii cu rusia va accepta sa renunte la aceste relatii
9335408 ca vor fi afectate economiile marilor tari europene va avea de suferit economia rusiei pentru ca rusia are la randul ei nevoie de marile state europene ca parteneri de modernizare
9335409 daca luam spre exemplu numai germania italia franta marile concerne ale acestor state s au implantat serios pe piata rusa toata lumea este constienta de faptul ca rusia nu depinde de marfurile lor toate produsele de lux pentru rusii bogati produsele de larg consum chiar si industria alimentara a germaniei toate sunt orientate spre rusia in rusia se vinde tot
9335410 ele pot cere sanctiuni economice si politice in detrimentul lor al germaniei si al altor mari tari ale europei
9335411 aceasta atitudine nu trebuie sa para ca o unda verde data rusiei de a ignora ce face ue
9335412 este gresit sa crezi ca ue a ajuns intr atat de divizat incat se poate jongla pe ideea vechea europa impotriva noii europe
9335413 europa nu vrea sa ajunga in situatia de a fi jucata pe degete de aceea vor fi lansate declaratii dure la adresa rusiei si cred ca europa isi va oferi eforturile pentru stabilizarea caucazului
9335414 in nici un caz nu poate fi vorba de sanctiuni serioase daca vor exista totusi ele vor avea un caracter simbolic de genul declaratiilor oficiale de stopare a negocierilor privind elaborarea noului acord de parteneriat si colaborare discutii care cinstit vorbind nici nu au inceput vor mai exista de asemenea recomandari privind suspendarea tratativelor de simplificare a regimului de vize sau de revizuire a politicii vizavi de noile proiecte energetice ale rusiei
9335415 problema este ca lovind in partenerii nostrii daca se va ajunge pana aici ne vom lovi pe noi insine pentru ca acest scenariu este imposibil de evitat intr un razboi rece nu exista invingatori pierd toti intrebarea este cine pierde mai mult

9335570 lys thats a rather unusual name even for a hamster
9335571 thanks but actually its not my real name its my university name here im lys dexia on account of my application form mum wrote my name in the box that asked the question other than being thick do you have any other impediments like lock jaw squinty eyes or a propensity towards incubating hamsters arse and then she scribbled the name of my impediment in the box that says name dumb huh
9335572 so how did you end up being called lys dexia i mean is that a real impediment ive never heard of it and im pretty up on that particular subject
9335573 yes i imagine in time that your mamma glands might suckle a good many young
9335574 although my breasts are exceedingly fulsome for my age im actually referring to my singing voice it saved my life until i came here i used to singly nightly for my uncle frapflap hes with the extermination board
9335575 its time to get your drawers off boy and go boulder bouncing
9335576 what do you want it for anyway you do mean my face i hope my gonads are little creased at the moment
9335577 im a reporter with the university magazine the chipped incisor
9335578 im here to do a piece on your heroic stunt

9335580 thats nice which side would you prefer personally i like my left theres a fleck of brown fur on my right flank it makes me look as though some burly rat has used me to wipe his 8 bottom
9335581 but where are we going i dont perform in public ill have you know and even my friend brutus would refrain from using a dining table
9335582 its nice and cosy and no one ever 9 goes there

9335590 have you done this to me havent i been the most perfect of sons to you or have i been a total arse
9335591 and my old scout badges not to mention a cozy bed and some supper how can fate be so cruel to a young hamster who possesses not one iota of malice within his slender boyish frame
9335592 so he isnt dead after all just stunned and battered
9335593 i can see youre feeling better lad best get you on yer feet before you melt all over the floor
9335594 you dont have a comb about your person i suppose
9335595 this is the most enchanting entity that i have ever laid my eyes upon she is simply divine were i a more heroic type and not a dull brained geek i would sweep her from the ground and carry her away to some tiny edifice built high in the tallest of rhubarb trees
9335596 i must apologize most fervently although i meant every word that i inadvertently spoke i feel i must retract them they are unbecoming especially when i speak so freely of someone i do not know
9335597 fanangy panakan at your service kind sir cripes listen to me ive come over all posh
9335598 youve been nose surfing on a sea of ka ka i had to hose you down
9335599 thats right i slipped in some effluent upon the road
9335600 its lucky i wasnt driving a go kart i could have had a nasty prang
9335601 as it happens i do believe that it might have been the most serendipitous pile of poop that ive ever encountered now may i have my clothes back im feeling a little vulnerable
9335602 you nearly took my claw varnish off with your teeth
9335603 wait til its gone down in between times i can tell you all about the where house
9335604 i dont mean to be impolite but surely after the disastrous johnny grainswallow expedition no one could either gather the funding or possess the temerity to launch another
9335605 but north america held more interest for certain individuals than just super hamsters with psychedelic brains and the deadly disease hamsters arse no there was area ninety nine
9335606 so there is such a place i mean its not all complete bollocks excuse my hamster french
9335607 you mean they just walked in and took the stuff
9335608 then the military tried to make weapons of mass destruction from it then they tried to reverse engineer it then they gave up and sold it to me for ten thousand rodentos
9335609 you made this into some sort of theme park a fantasy palace you promised to take hamsters to impossible places and see wonderful ah thingys and wotsits
9335610 all sorts of rodents rats mice gerbils i even took a cavy once no rabbits though too vicious even the tame ones what you can ride
9335611 i got bus loads of em to start with but when i showed em all the wonders to be found in the artifacts of area ninety nine well most of em thought it was clever visual effects others thought theyd gone mad others went 11 completely off their heads and some even lost control of their bowels well of course i had to start administering sedatives didnt i then nobody believed in anything they saw they just thought theyd been on some kinda drug induced trip like you get from them mushrooms up at danglydong dell the business went tits up overnight didnt it
9335612 so how do you make repayments on the ten thousand rodento loan
9335613 but i get by with selling the odd trinket that i find here and there when i go exploring
9335614 ya dont think i got all these area ninety nine artifacts sitting about on shelves gathering dust do ya
9335615 theyve got to pay their way you know otherwise its the scrap dealer for em and i know at least one of em who wouldnt want that to happen
9335616 stay right there ill get some stumps and stuff from the shed
9335617 look cruncher with this lot we could take on the prince rupert of bandigal second eleven
9335618 i dont have a cricket ball but this one is pretty hard it should do
9335619 ill bowl you bat look you stand like this then you hit the ball when i throw it at you if you hit it a long way you can then run up and down again until i come back with it if you knock it over the wall thats a four if you knock it into farmer buckseys barn thats a six if you catch me with a crushing blow to my private parts well youve won the game outright got it
9335620 crunchers not listening to me again he appears to be completely controlled by his stomach
9335621 just leave that arsehole of a caterpillar alone will you
9335622 hes always doing that these days i want to play cricket but im afraid hell eat the stumps
9335623 he hasnt got any paws to hold the bat with
9335624 and enormous mandibles he could hold seven bats with those
9335625 anyway the cricket season finished weeks ago so youre wasting your time anyway
9335626 thats your trouble you dont think if you thought at all youd be down the park with all the other boy hamsters
9335627 good idea i shall set out immediately upon a forthright endeavour i might be gone some time keep a light in the window for me
9335628 oh i dont know a warm day and lots to eat
9335629 would they like going on holiday if it was warm and they had lots to eat
9335630 holiday homes and caterpillars are mutually exclusive theres an incompatibility quotient of er one hundred and five percent so you cant take him ever so there
9335631 i wasnt talkin bout cruncher i was referrin to your scooter you cant put a sidecar on a scooter
9335632 now you just get off home and remove that orrible thing
9335633 id like four please three for me and one for cruncher
9335634 i didnt make these delicious tummy teasers for a brainless git like him
9335635 mum i have come to realise that cruncher is a big fat turd consequently i have quite gone off him i want uncle desmond to take a look at him if necessary i would like him to experiment upon my formerly beloved pet if dissection is required then so be it
9335636 arent you over reacting slightly hes fat hes not the love child of gurkinstiens monster
9335637 but i cannot rest until i get to the bottom of this mystery
9335638 how much faster can you render the blue screen of death
9335639 well not sure if its relevant but from what i hear from people at my university research is going on delving deeper into a cpu that uses light instead of electricity as light travels much faster than electrons
9335640 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9335641 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9335642 my adrenaline was pumping at the start but after that i settled down a bit early on i was nit picking with the corners and not throwing many strikes i was getting behind in the count but as the game went on i settled down and felt good
9335643 i think he jimenez got away from his fastball and then he really tried to go back to his fastball and it seemed like he tried to crank it and overthrew it
9335644 we didnt have the recipe to win this game on either side of the ball
9335645 are capable of bringing justice and punishment to the evil exploiters of the world if they choose to intervene in the internal affairs of the arab nation and of the muslim peoples of the world

9335656 if tehran obtained the s 300 it would be a game changer in military thinking for tackling iran that could be a catalyst for israeli air attacks before its operational
9335657 sharemarkets are up significantly one day and then they give back the next day he said
9335658 i dont think weve broken out of the sideways trading band as yet
9335659 really it didnt live up to those expectations he said
9335660 it was much more upbeat than a lot of investors believed
9335661 once you strip out the diversified financials and real estate which were hit by writedowns then profit was up in the order of 9 2 per cent
9335662 however the next few months are likely to remain rough for shares as the economic downturn feeds into more profit downgrades particularly for cyclical sectors and as bank asset write downs continue dr oliver said
9335663 historically the september october period has been poor for shares
9335664 in fact september is the worst month of the year for us shares and october is often the worst month of the year for australian shares

9335669 people gave the impression we were close when rice was here but its not over we would have a serious problem if we took it to the parliament right now
9335670 these are diversionary tactics to avoid a decision its not a question of negotiating teams its a matter of do you want it or dont you
9335671 they are avoiding the issue they dont want a status of forces agreement they dont want a security agreement
9335672 the talks have reached a critical point now they need a political decision not a technical one
9335673 hamoud had to deal with too many people and then comes to a meeting with the prime minister
9335674 why does he have to change the leaders of the negotiating team and now why we had reached the last part why does he have to change it
9335675 watch out for false prophets they come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are like ferocious wolves

9335677 bushs job is to figure out a way to pass the torch in a way that does the least damage
9335678 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9335679 he knows its not his convention hes had two of them and hell behave accordingly
9335680 the real tehran is like a playing card you have to flip it over to see its true side
9335681 he was a bastard but at least he did something positive for us
9335682 in this business the only problem is flights if sanctions expand to flight bans were in trouble
9335683 if you want to know where we get them from i wont tell you
9335684 i always have my customers and what i have goes very quickly
9335685 when we are outside we are quiet and unobtrusive inside we do a lot of things outside nothing

9335691 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9335692 a screw up on the part of our research team
9335693 our supporters our staff get overzealous they start saying things that i would not say
9335694 it is my responsibility to make sure that were setting a clear tone in our campaign
9335695 you made up for each others mistakes you didnt blame each other when things went wrong
9335696 if people were willing to submerge their egos and just focus on bringing their particular gifts and passion and energy and vision to a common task that great things can be accomplished
9335697 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments

9335701 help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people
9335702 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9335703 as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need
9335704 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9335705 there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9335706 the economic stimulus package that i signed earlier this year is having its intended effect
9335707 many americans who received tax rebates are spending them businesses are taking advantage of tax incentives to purchase new equipment this year and there are signs that the stimulus package will continue to have a beneficial impact on the economy in the second half of the year
9335708 there are families across our country struggling to make ends meet
9335709 there is an understandable concern about the high price of gas and food and many americans are worried about the health of our housing and job markets i share these concerns about our economy
9335710 it wasnt me i was just curious i was trying to be responsible and get some condoms for when i finally give my flower to neil this thing came with it a gift with purchase i love the gift with purchase anyway i followed the instructions and before i knew it it was too late i tried to say no but it was sooooo good i didnt know i just didnt know sob im not a slut
9335711 prices are more affected down south while new york is supplied through new york harbor
9335712 i think some of those areas are going to get hit hard again and its really going to squeeze people
9335713 those of us who grew up in middle class neighborhoods like scranton and wilmington
9335714 sen joseph r biden accepted the vice presidential nomination of the democratic party with a speech that harkened back to his working class roots in scranton
9335715 he was working as a sales representative for amoco oil co in harrisburg
9335716 biden also was an executive in a boston based company that supplied waterproof sealant for u s merchant marine ships built during world war ii after the war he co owned an airport and crop dusting service on long island
9335717 worked in the state first as a sales manager for auto dealerships and later in real estate condominium sales
9335718 the most elegantly dressed perfectly manicured perfectly tailored car sales manager wilmington del had ever seen

9335720 a member of the u s olympic diving team was disqualified from competition today when it was learned that he did not have a sufficiently compelling human story line to exploit on the nbc telecast of the worldwide sporting event
9335721 a gathering was held within the last year in mexico consisting of some twenty persons from the peace communities of north america
9335722 i believe there is enough latent violence in this room to begin a war
9335723 if this is indeed true then what is required in order to stop a war
9335724 you know i think that someone would be required to die
9335725 the level of being of a man attracts his life
9335726 only a fool is interested in other peoples guilt since he cannot alter it the wise man learns only from his own guilt he will ask himself who am i that all this should happen to me to find the answer to this fateful question he will look into his own heart
9335727 there is a tombstone near my childhood home in england which admonishes the passer by
9335728 man is like a tree if you stand in front of a tree and watch it incessantly to see how it grows and to see how much it has grown you will see nothing at all but tend to it at all times prune the runners and keep the vermin from it and all in good time it will come into its growth it is the same with man all that is necessary is for him to overcome his obstacles and he will thrive and grow but it is not right to examine him every hour to see how much has been added to his growth
9335729 is there a picture of that terrorist plane hitting the pentagon

9335732 the two worked together for barely a week after which mccain accused obama of partisan posturing
9335733 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9335734 this is probably the case with almost any emergency which is as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9335735 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9335736 will test parts of the levee that were not tested during katrina
9335737 but there are still a lot of vulnerabilities this could be a a much worse storm hopefully it wont be but the possibilities are definitely there
9335738 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9335739 these subjects are part of a longer and mid term discussion
9335740 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9335741 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9335742 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9335743 a number of the hospitals that originally planned to shelter in place have now decided they are going to actually try to evacuate their critically ill and medical needs patients
9335744 as a consequence weve had to increase the tempo of our air flights into new orleans in order to make sure that we can accommodate the flow were going to be watching this very carefully today
9335745 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9335746 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9335747 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9335748 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in
9335749 ill never leave again just being away worrying about it last time id have rather been here
9335750 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9335751 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9335752 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9335753 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9335754 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9335755 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9335756 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in
9335757 ill never leave again just being away worrying about it last time id have rather been here
9335758 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9335759 were the volunteer state and were stepping up to the plate
9335760 these soldiers work around the clock capturing known criminals and keeping violence off the streets of the rashid district
9335761 they continue to provide a safe and secure environment for the 1 5 million residents of southern baghdad
9335762 garbage typically hasnt been called an economic indicator but we firmly believe it is
9335763 solid waste production goes up and down with the economy
9335764 we see our own garbage and we think thats what fills up landfills
9335765 but a big chunk of landfills is construction debris its not so much that were buying fewer 2 liter soda bottles its less construction going on
9335766 dont represent that big of a piece to account for the kinds of fluctuations were seeing in the amounts going into the landfills
9335767 we have seen in the past that with downturns in the economy disposal tonnage reduces
9335768 has taken a substantial dip in the past two or three years
9335769 for the first six months of 2008 weve seen a 3 decline year over year
9335770 last year we took in 871 000 tons this year were on track to take in closer to 820 000 tons
9335771 we have seen a slowdown in what has been set out at the curb
9335772 when you see that from our perspective people arent buying as much or buying the large ticket items
9335773 most pronounced is a decline in construction and demolition waste as real estate construction slows along with the economy
9335774 we rely on people to throw things away to make money cash flow has been a problem for the past two years because of declining quantities
9335775 ive had enough kidnapping corrupt police a rotten judicial system
9335776 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9335777 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9335778 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9335779 when you go out you go with fear are you going to make it home or not
9335780 the lord is with everyone so of course everything would be ok
9335781 i think once i get there to arkansas im going straight to stone mountain ga
9335782 i gave myself a year and a half to make it in new orleans but the city isnt back from katrina and its time to leave
9335783 if i can find the work i dont have to go back
9335784 thats what those cameras dont understand everyone on this bus just wants a better life no matter where we find it
9335785 she doesnt care for the republican party in alaska and the old guard doesnt care for her
9335786 when oil is that high and alaska is that rich
9335787 its pretty easy being governor because you have enough money to please everybody shes not going to have that easy a go in washington
9335788 we basically have the rest of sunday to complete the evacuation of the coast of louisiana as well as evacuation activities in texas and mississippi
9335789 he is fully committed to throwing all federal assets into this fight
9335790 that strikes me as exceptionally foolish people should heed the instructions to evacuate and protect their own lives
9335791 every area where the storm passed is reporting damage to homes and public buildings
9335792 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9335793 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9335794 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9335795 im concerned about whats going to happen over the next 10 to 20 years as we clean up the atmosphere
9335796 as the air clears are we going to see a major acceleration in warming
9335797 asia has a large population its economies are developing so rapidly and its emissions are large and changing rapidly
9335798 were trying to find out why clouds in southern china are operating under a different set of rules
9335799 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9335800 were keeping a very close eye on what this hurricane is doing
9335801 if it looks like its going to hit we will obviously drastically change our plans this is not a time to celebrate
9335802 we are monitoring the storm and are moving forward with our scheduled program at this time
9335803 we understand that some participants may need to remain home to prepare their states for the approaching storm while we intend to gavel our convention to order on monday afternoon our convention places country first and ensuring the safety of our citizens is of paramount importance
9335804 insult it would be a complete insult and i think theyll do it anyway
9335805 we need that much time to get the facility back in its original capacity
9335806 thats the estimated time it would take just for the load out
9335807 it would take additional labor but it would be possible
9335808 of course its not ideal you always want to stay on schedule but were used to adjusting plans based on the needs of our clients and well work with them
9335809 it would be a disservice to the american people if they cannot see our convention too
9335810 canadians should prepare themselves for cases like the listeriosis incident as we continue to deregulate this is the result of a risk based system that puts business in front of health
9335811 processed food will never be a hundred percent safe to eat no mather how many inspectors you put on the production line
9335812 this will be a wake up call both for food manufacturers and inspectors
9335813 because we know the government wont protect our house so we have to
9335814 this is going to be the storm of the century
9335815 this is the mother of all storms and im not sure weve seen anything like this
9335816 the levees in the city of new orleans are probably 8 to 10 feet high
9335817 if those levees dont hold it will be the end for new orleans
9335818 i went to hoover dam and i didnt see any leaks why should our levees be leaking
9335819 there is not a building in this city rated above 150 mph in wind resistance
9335820 millions have been pumped in to those levees something has to hold right
9335821 they dont dare do what they did to us during katrina again

9336023 the challenge for alain and me was to come up with a style that would be unique to this character would represent a military fight style but also the street in defining his fight style we wanted to create a look that is consistent with a guy who also uses guns and weaponry easily but who is adept at hand to hand in essence his fight style had to feel effective but not overly choreographed
9336024 babylon a d is set in the very near future on earth
9336025 this sort of setting allows you to think freely about what life could be like in a different time while also giving you a sense of reality in essence by setting it in the near future you have an easier time getting your audience to suspend belief for a minute while you introduce them to a world where the limits have been pushed to the maximum

9336051 mas unconditional embrace of the chinese market is not good for taiwanese people
9336052 if we are over dependent on china economically eventually we will be forced to unite with china politically
9336053 the fact that china has not withdrawn its missiles aimed at taiwan shows its lack of friendliness toward us
9336054 look at the sky we are not alone the whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work
9336055 when a person really desires something all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream

9336082 speech i thought al gore managing to compare obama to another first term jr senator from illinois mister abe no mustache lincoln himslf was very cleaver and i find it almost offensive that these drones who were hillary clinton supporters now may vote for mccain because he has used the cute gimmick of adding the sassy sarah palin to his ticket if these voters actually believed in hillary because of her stance on the issues palin is the poller opposite on most veering extreme to the right if say they thought hillary brought more experience

9336119 youre looking at a half a per cent lower gdp growth in the first and second quarters which means there is more slack in the economy
9336120 the argument is when we think about it in very general terms the argument is that the case for sustained low interest rates is i think overwhelming
9336121 basically were looking at a broader based and probably more material global slowdown than people were thinking a month or two ago
9336122 i think youre seeing more softness abroad than people anticipated and youre looking at more of a policy response catching up to what the u s has done
9336123 the ability to reach out not just to government leaders but to the people of our allies
9336124 he will be able to communicate more effectively with the leaders of our allies and the people that this is their fight too i think that level of communication hasnt been forthcoming from president bushs administration they have been preoccupied with iraq which is not a conflict that has a lot of popular support
9336125 i believe that one of the things he will bring to the challenge of bringing more resources to afghanistan is clarity of where the serious issue is it is along that afghani pakistan border this will be a priority with president obama
9336126 most americans are feeling pretty good about their jobs and their personal lives
9336127 in gallups august 2008 survey 48 working americans said they were completely satisfied and another 42 somewhat satisfied only 9 were dissatisfied with their jobs
9336128 very few jobs are lost each year to companies moving jobs offshore
9336129 goal likely would be difficult perhaps impossible to achieve and flies in the face of how global oil markets work
9336130 if you had asked me a year ago whether this degree of financial chaos was consistent with a domestic u s economy not clearly in recession i would have said no
9336131 you see vehicles destroyed by rockets on the side of the road
9336132 the wreckage isnt there for long the army soon removes it to make it look as if they are still in control of the road but they are on the verge of losing it
9336133 if there is a more dangerous job in pakistan i would like to know what it is
9336134 if nato lost control of the pass there is no doubt that other routes would be found
9336135 but they are more difficult and expensive it would interfere with the smooth running of the operation
9336136 there is certainly some enemy action on this supply route
9336137 but it has no impact on our mission in afghanistan
9336138 you used to see a lot of oil tankers that were damaged but the chassis and the engine were fine
9336139 the government is aware of these attacks on convoys in the khyber region and it is one of the reasons why we have had a major military operation there in the past few weeks
9336140 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy
9336141 this is a system that scares every western air force
9336142 they are saying if you dont stop meddling in our sphere of influence this is what we are going to do
9336143 back georgia and ukraine for nato membership and youll see the s 300 to iran it is a very powerful bargaining chip and a major deterrent to us actions in the region moscow is playing very strategically on americas obsession with iran
9336144 iran certainly thinks it has a deal and the israelis believe that a deal has been reached but that they can still block it
9336145 if tehran obtained the s 300 it would be a game changer in military thinking for tackling iran that could be a catalyst for israeli air attacks before its operational
9336146 the west has to be careful because russia has the cards today
9336147 read the real facts mikko it was kennedy who blinked not krushchev
9336148 these are diversionary tactics to avoid a decision its not a question of negotiating teams its a matter of do you want it or dont you
9336149 people gave the impression we were close when rice was here but its not over
9336150 we would have a serious problem if we took it to parliament right now
9336151 i remember him talking about her when he came back
9336152 he said she was an impressive woman he liked her
9336153 he was down to the point that if the meeting had gone well and it was expected to go well there was going to be an offer
9336154 i dont think he would have invited her if it werent his intention to offer her the job
9336155 nobody was vetted less or more than anyone in the final stages and john had access to all that information and made the decision
9336156 if republicans are run out of congress in november one big reason will be that like mr murkowski they have become far more comfortable running the government than reforming it
9336157 our forces are ready to take the security responsibility tomorrow monday
9336158 they are controlling the situation our troops are on alert to avert any failure of the transfer
9336159 we are happy that iraqi forces will be in control now of the security rather than the foreign troops that is how it should be iraqis should protect the iraqis
9336160 our forces are not ready to take responsibility for the situation i am sorry to say but there is lot of corruption in our security forces
9336161 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
9336162 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9336163 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9336164 kill him kill kill you have to kill him you understand
9336165 make themselves like a man a woman like a man the punishment is kill kill them throw them from the highest place
9336166 this is not to tell you to start killing people
9336167 there must be a muslim leader when the muslim army becomes stronger when islam has grown enough
9336168 islam is keeping away from disbelief and from the disbelievers the people who disbelieve
9336169 its part of islam of the correct belief that you love those who love allah and that you hate those who hate allah
9336170 it is not befitting for muslims that he should reside in the land of evil the land of the kuffaar the land of the disbelievers
9336171 some conditions can take you into disbelief to take the british citizenship whether you like it or not for these people you are selling your religion its a very serious thing it is not allowed to give allegiance to other than allah
9336172 what are these people doing in there these things are so vile what they say with their tongues is so vile and disgusting its an abomination
9336173 this is false it does not work this concept is a lie it is fake and it is a farce
9336174 sister if me and my husband we cant go together what do i do if i want to go
9336175 you know that working in an environment that is not islamic working with the kuffaar all this takes you away from the religion and hardens your heart and it would be lying to you if i say its ok
9336176 you see muslims in every sphere of everyday life in this country i see muslims it breaks my heart when i see them working in banks short sleeves tight scarf like this make up being with the kuffaar all the time even speaking their language
9336177 the icc the london central mosque and islamic cultural centre most commonly referred to as the regents park mosque is committed to interfaith and cross cultural understanding
9336178 it does not support or condone extreme views racial hatred violence or intolerance
9336179 whilst it is recommended for a muslim to migrate to a muslim country it is not obligatory
9336180 we are not blind followers of any government or any clerics we do criticise other religions just as other religions criticise islam we encourage integration into society
9336181 you may regard these juristic and textual rulings as extreme restrictions
9336182 but we see them as our way of life and a liberation of the soul
9336183 their time will come like every other evil persons time will come
9336184 then people can see people without hands people can see in public heads rolling down the street people got sic their hands and feet from opposite sides chopped off and they see them crucified they see people put up against the pole and see them get lashed in public they see it and because they see it it acts as a deterrent for them because they say i dont want that to happen to me
9336185 the lecture was aimed at reforming the muslim people the muslim society and the muslim world to be adjudicated by the sovereign islamic state
9336186 we try to represent a variety of opinions through the products we sell in order to spread peace respect tolerance and understanding
9336187 despite having no control over the bookshop we met with those running the bookshop after your programme was broadcast we made it clear that it was not acceptable for the bookshop to stock materials containing extremist views we were assured all offending material had been removed
9336188 petrodollar money coming from saudi arabia has basically distorted the growth and development of the muslim community in britain
9336189 the abuse and misuse of this great faith of mine
9336190 the underlying motive here is to find a way of continuously implanting this permanent wedge between the wider british society and the younger muslims living in britain
9336191 to think as i believe our government thinks that it makes ideological sense to play patsy with the saudi government is folly of the first order of magnitude we will be paying for it for years to come
9336192 hezbollah succeeded in incorporating the idea of resistance as part of the international anti globalization movements
9336193 through our contacts with these groups we have managed to challenge the idea that hezbollah is a dogmatic terrorist islamist organization and convince part of the international left that we can be a strong partner
9336194 we think of the sacrifices of all the militants in lebanon and palestine and the arab world from islamists to nationalists to arabists or any ideological background they come from
9336195 hezbollah is aware today of the importance of cultivating contacts with the west
9336196 social forums are open spaces of discussion they present an opportunity for a group like hezbollah to participate and give their opinions
9336197 it was a potent symbol that right makes might and that a guerrilla ready to fight for its people can succeed
9336198 some leftist groups refuse to consider what islamist organizations are about their oppressive practices their violations of rights their dogmatic rhetoric
9336199 lifes not safe for a black man in this country barack never has been probably never will be
9336200 we have to complete the annapolis process this year this year
9336201 it is not realistic to expect that theres a quick fix or a shortcut we wont solve the conflict issues on the table in two or three weeks
9336202 the differences on the core issues are still very wide
9336203 legal legitimacy to negotiate and certainly not to reach any agreement
9336204 mike thought he could escape the pain by creating a diversion from his addiction to adult pornography so he created the cancer scenario
9336205 we fully understand the questions shock disbelief and even anger you may feel but michael is struggling with a different kind of illness and is receiving professional help
9336206 ive been hiding who i am for so long i can honestly say to you that the last two years have been hell for me physically emotionally but i never sat down and said lets try and fool the world
9336207 this is who i am im addicted to the stuff it consumes my mind
9336208 im sick and this is why i had to come up with some sort of explanation of what was happening in my body i dont know how you can fake vomiting all over yourself night after night after night im not that good an actor
9336209 i never questioned it when you love someone you trust them i had no reason not to trust him
9336210 perhaps i feel a little bit foolish in this hindsights a fabulous thing but im trying not to beat myself up
9336211 i believed every word he said i believed he was going through hell
9336212 my heart goes out to all the people who have been hurt to make all this up is extremely crushing for anyone who has gone through cancer theres no better script than to be dying of cancer and giving glory to god in a christian context its the highest form of fraud
9336213 i saw michael talk and sing and hes so very charismatic but what a con
9336214 healer song is god breathed i believe that and mike guglielmucci is one of the millions of christians who are struggling with the same temptation i still believe in pastor mike and love him i am praying for him god will use this song to heal those who are hurting
9336215 who are we to condemn him god will forgive him lets pray for his relationship with god instead of shouting stupid things
9336216 the kind of person who when he says i will change america will do what he says
9336217 i believe that barack obama will achieve peace in the area in the middle east and palestine between us the palestinian people and the jewish people
9336218 no such group has been authorized to solicit on behalf of the campaign
9336219 but these are the same people who are preventing it
9336220 hes a good man to achieve the goal of bringing peace between israelis and palestinians
9336221 we dont want to live in war in siege many want peace
9336222 i think people in the world dont understand gaza very well they think that all the people here are terrorists not educated we want to persuade them that we can live like any other people in the world
9336223 from television and film i learned to love democratic life
9336224 hes black and hes better than president george w bush
9336225 historically it was the democrats who achieved peace between palestinians and the israelis
9336226 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9336227 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9336228 it all depends upon what happens with these storms first things first and thats protecting the people of my state
9336229 because shes a reformer and she thinks outside the box the way my husband does
9336230 you know washington is just a quagmire its a mess right now and both of them have been serious reformers
9336231 no no no i completely disagree and i know my husband does too she is heavily experienced in what she has done
9336232 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here its also about making decisions and be targeted in what she thinks she has a great mind and she has a very serious direction in where she goes
9336233 in fairness to governor palin lets do the same analysis for senator obama what is it in his background that would give him the same sort of requisite wisdom and judgment on national security matters
9336234 palin is commander in chief of the alaskan national guard
9336235 those of us who grew up in middle class neighborhoods like delaware
9336236 sen joseph r biden accepted the vice presidential nomination of the democratic party with a speech that harkened back to his working class roots in scranton
9336237 he was working as a sales representative for amoco oil co in harrisburg
9336238 biden also was an executive in a boston based company that supplied waterproof sealant for u s merchant marine ships built during world war ii after the war he co owned an airport and crop dusting service on long island
9336239 worked in the state first as a sales manager for auto dealerships and later in real estate condominium sales
9336240 the most elegantly dressed perfectly manicured perfectly tailored car sales manager wilmington had ever seen

9336242 a member of the u s olympic diving team was disqualified from competition today when it was learned that he did not have a sufficiently compelling human story line to exploit on the nbc telecast of the worldwide sporting event
9336243 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9336244 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9336245 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9336246 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9336247 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9336248 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9336249 i am learning how to fight the jews and kill jewish children
9336250 the parents of the jewish children are the soldiers and officers who kill us here i want these parents to get a taste of what its like to have your children killed just as the palestinians experience every day
9336251 i would rather die fighting the occupation than die at home from a missile which is what happened to hundreds of palestinian children
9336252 every day we hear threats from israel and witness its training exercises therefore we must be prepared
9336253 this is an enemy that cannot be trusted and is famous for breaking its promises the enemy even killed the prophets it cannot be trusted
9336254 why are they permitted to train and we are not they are preparing to invade territory that is not theirs and we are training to protect our lands and children
9336255 the palestinian people support the resistance and understand that we are responding to the occupation and that these children are being recruited to help defend their homes and their land we are preparing these children to fight the enemy as the enemy does not differentiate between children and adults it wants to annihilate the entire palestinian nation
9336256 we will unleash the fires of hell if the zionist enemy continues its crimes
9336257 the zionist enemy will have neither peace nor security while it occupies our land
9336258 will not rest until we have liberated all of palestine
9336259 us intelligence fears the kremlin will supply the sophisticated s 300 system to
9336260 can track 100 targets at once and fire on planes up to 75 miles away
9336261 this is a system that scares every western air force
9336262 they are saying if you dont stop meddling in our sphere of influence this is what we are going to do
9336263 back georgia and ukraine for nato membership and youll see the s 300 to iran it is a very powerful bargaining chip and a major deterrent to us actions in the region moscow is playing very strategically on americas obsession with iran
9336264 moscow has been infuriated by the steady encroachment of nato into the former soviet bloc and the recent granting of independence to the ex serbian province of kosovo against its wishes
9336265 in a deliberate signal of how it could cause trouble for washington
9336266 already moved some basic components for the system to its close ally belarus ready for possible transfer to iran
9336267 iran certainly thinks it has a deal and the israelis believe that a deal has been reached but that they can still block it
9336268 our countrys technology has advanced to the level where we can freely launch a working satellite at any time
9336269 the kwangmyoungsong was successfully launched at that time in the face of imperialists attempt to isolate our country and repeated outbreak of natural disasters
9336270 will not accept any partial deal like a framework or shelf agreement
9336271 the most critical issue that threatens the whole peace process now
9336272 goals of the 20 year plan wont materialize under the present policies unless executive officials really change their views
9336273 we see that assets are transferred from an open to a shadow government
9336274 we are afraid to go back if there wont be any police or soldiers
9336275 the ossetians were coming in cars pushing young people into cars and taking them to tskhinvali
9336276 at any minute they could come and start shooting the russians and the ossetians
9336277 maybe the russians wont harm us but we are still afraid
9336278 i went into the fields to sleep i put grass on top of myself to hide
9336279 these subjects are part of a longer and midterm discussion
9336280 these international agreements will spell out our obligations on providing support and assistance economic social humanitarian and military
9336281 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
9336282 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
9336283 everyone is focusing on japan as the big team in the group but i know uzbekistan from before when he was the south korea national coach they were the first team to qualify for this round so there is no reason to underestimate them
9336284 they play a russian style of football physically strong skilful with good organisation and the fans will be very fanatic
9336285 it is an interesting challenge it can help qualification if we can get a good result over there but it wont be easy
9336286 expansion of the a league is a critical issue to the continuing evolution and growth of football and this is a very exciting day for the ffa everyone involved in the a league gold coast united and north queensland
9336287 they are here but that is all you can say about them
9336288 well have a full injury report for you next friday
9336289 hell be designated as whether he practiced or did not practice at this point i would expect he would practice
9336290 os bancos centrais h muito que s o considerados membros honor rios das for as de mercado

9336292 near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent after jesse spent great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling and now he has no choice but to look ahead to week 5
9336293 i never said i have a girlfriend and i never said i dont have a girlfriend
9336294 my public and private life are separate i keep my private life to myself
9336295 well see if i really am a fish out of water and if i have a comedic side to me all of my friends are giving me a hard time about it and saying i better not mess up and better not do this or do that
9336296 we are delighted proud and elated we are just as excited as we were about mei lans birth this is another great moment for the city of atlanta our colleagues in china as well as zoo members guests and staff
9336297 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9336298 im looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9336299 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9336300 with hurricane gustav now a category 4 storm it could end up being the worst hurricane to strike the gulf coast region of the u s since hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 gustavs strength is enough to damage oil and gas platforms as well as oil refineries as hurricanes katrina and rita did in 2005 energy prices had climbed all week as gustavs path was being plotted which put it dead center along the same region of the gulf coast as the powerful hurricane katrina of 2005 that flooded new orleans and left over 1500 dead in its wake
9336301 most people dont have cars to leave dont have money for gas pay for a hotel for that long i mean you have to do whatever you have to do and i guess im gonna stay and work
9336302 i wanted to dress a little upscale for my voluptuous debut
9336303 i wear business casual if im going out but my relaxed casual usually consists of shorts and a spaghetti shirt
9336304 im naked in my apartment most of the time unless its too cold to be bare
9336305 il tentativo di riconciliare nella memoria culturale le due italie che guareschi e pasolini incarnavano con una passione e una dedizione di cui nel tempo si desolatamente perduta traccia

9336307 there was a nice big kiss at the end with both hands on the cheeks
9336308 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
9336309 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
9336310 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9336311 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9336312 good lord we had barely 12 hours of democrat optimism
9336313 it was a stunningly timed piece of pr by the republicans
9336314 well get a taste in the next five days of how well she does in the 62 days that follow
9336315 seems like a compelling person with a terrific personal story
9336316 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9336317 i was raised in a family where gender was not going to be an issue
9336318 the girls did what the boys did apparently in alaska thats quite commonplace
9336319 they made us line up in bathing suits and turn our backs so the male judges could look at our butts i couldnt believe it
9336320 i cant claim a bill clinton and say i never inhaled
9336321 it has really opened my eyes to international events and how war impacts everyday americans like us
9336322 we had a bad fishing year so we didnt have any money
9336323 my husband loves being a dad as much as i love being a mom
9336324 im looking at him right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9336325 i just put down the blackberrys and pick up the breast pump
9336326 having had two children at home at the age of four months i know how much help they need even without unfortunate medical conditions
9336327 i really feel mother knows best without the peanut gallery giving unsolicited advice she strongly conveys to women today that you dont have to choose between a successful career and motherhood you do have to make sacrifices but you can have it all
9336328 i would just trust that the child is not neglected in any way there are millions of women who work why is it that the father cannot provide the same standard of care there has been an evolving view of working women even in conservative christian circles
9336329 i didnt think the republicans would pick a female candidate for another decade but john mccain is not a typical conservative leader
9336330 what lies behind the pretty face is a standard rank and file republican
9336331 feminists for life who opposes abortion even in cases of rape or incest
9336332 an embarrassing decision this woman does not have the experience to assume the mantle of the most powerful job in the world
9336333 i am offended by mccains choice of palin none of the above qualifies me for vp nor palin it is a cynical insult to the political judgment of american women so says kris branamann of snellville ga usa
9336334 palin is gunning for the 18m women who voted for hillary clinton a third of whom have not made up their mind to back obama
9336335 palin is gunning for the 18m women who voted for hillary clinton
9336336 interested parties should have their say now on the sale and rent back market those of you who wish to submit your views on the draft code of practice for landlords involved in the sale and rent back market have only got a few more days to send in your response
9336337 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
9336338 he had to marry the lady because she was with child
9336339 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
9336340 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
9336341 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time

9336345 from brothers to bitter enemies to now getting along again

9336347 going forward we plan to re examine this no we do understand that this is a great feature and are looking into adding it as we move forward no we are looking to expanding this aspect of the game for a sequel we tried to do the best with the time we had no not for this version in the future absolutely no there will not be any knockouts in the game no there is no option to create female wrestlers no there will only be 5 spots for created wrestlers no there is no blood no only 4 wrestlers can be in the ring no you cannot slam somebody through a table kaz and petey williams will be available only through downloadable content we ran out of time tna blackmailed us we are being held hostage until this game comes out
9336348 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
9336349 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
9336350 it is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped each time a man stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope
9336351 i hate you mrs tucker youre a mean old lady i hate you
9336352 but im sure not going to let you pull the other childrens hair
9336353 im sorry i called you a mean old lady mrs tucker
9336354 you work magic with him mrs tucker he doesnt respond to anybody like he does to you
9336355 ich habe gerade herausgefunden dass ich im n chsten tarentino film mit brad pitt zusammen arbeiten werde ich bin sehr aufgeregt ich spiele einen deutschen filmstar aber ich will nicht zuviel verraten
9336356 we have come to celebrate a great life that speaks for itself
9336357 you have given me and my family more you have given your people and this country more than you will ever know
9336358 if this work was hard or overwhelming if she ever felt any loneliness in so often being the first you never wouldve known it
9336359 because stephanie was not a complainer she always had that big smile even when times were tough self pity was never an option as far as stephanie was concerned
9336360 during this most recent contest stephanie and i started off on different sides and she we would see each other and she just said to me this is what it means to be a friend for me
9336361 what struck me most about stephanie was how even after a decade in congress she was so utterly unaffected by the ways of washington
9336362 she was still a home girl stephanie couldnt put on airs if she tried
9336363 its impossible to say that this system is going to do this or that
9336364 at the end of the forecast track the wind shear could let up a bit
9336365 its a mistake and often a grave one to focus on a single model
9336366 it was no more status quo no more politics as usual it was all about change so then to see that obama literally part of his campaign uses those themes even new energy change all that i think o k well we were a little bit ahead on that
9336367 somethings kind of changing here in alaska too for being such a red state on the presidential level
9336368 non amano scaldarsi troppo hanno gi un temperatura superiore ai 38 gradi e indossano sempre letteralmente una giacca di pelle scura la direzione nord sud potrebbe aiutarli a rinfrescarsi

9336395 die familien porsche und piech stehen voll und ganz hinter wendelin wiedeking und dem gesamten vorstand der porsche holding
9336396 wir haben alle beschl sse in sachen vw einvernehmlich getragen daran gibt es nichts zu r tteln
9336397 dieser sturm ist so kr ftig und gewinnt jeden tag an st rke dass ich nicht sicher bin ob wir so etwas schon jemals gesehen haben
9336398 es w re nicht angemessen eine festliche versammlung zu veranstalten w hrend eine nahe gelegene trag die sich als ein nationales desaster herausstellt
9336399 si se sigue sembrando nuestra tierra con semilla transg nica y espolvore ndola con los pesticidas que son su media naranja ni los nuevos hospitales dar n abasto
9336400 hace tres meses dice un beb naci con un solo pulmoncito yo mismo tuve una infecci n que no era una infecci n natural que a uno se le pasa con un medicamento y ahora hay 23 familias que denuncian la contaminaci n porque los primeros tiempos eran los animales los que ten an los problemas pero ahora son las personas mismas
9336401 somos organizaciones que llevamos a os luchando y elaborando propuestas para defender los derechos de las familias campesinas y abor genes a poder seguir viviendo con dignidad en y del campo
9336402 entre 1998 y 2002 explican desaparecieron 160 000 explotaciones agropecuarias en su mayor a menores de 200 hect reas es decir de peque os productores
9336403 en la regi n hay cinco ejes de problemas la tierra el agua la contaminaci n y la producci n y comercializaci n de las cosas
9336404 zonas que antes no se inundaban ahora s y zonas que antes no ahora est n secas
9336405 nosotros nos vamos quedando sin los campos dice y sin la familia porque los hijos se nos van no queremos ser asistidos por planes sociales porque nosotros producimos pero los pueblitos m s chicos est n desapareciendo y eso nos duele porque no hay una pol tica de trabajo una pol tica de desarrollo para el peque o productor por qu a m me est faltando el agua y al otro que es un gran empresario le est sobrando el agua cu ntas m quinas para riego tienen y a nosotros nos est n llevando el agua con los bidoncitos as se nos est n muriendo los animales no tenemos qu darles de comer los campos que antes us bamos que eran campos que no se conoc an y que eran campos del estado ahora aparecen con due o
9336406 en mi provincia pasa lo mismo no tanto con los desmontes pero s con la desregularizaci n y la venta de las tierras

9336413 i couldnt figure out why all of these kept flashing their lights at us as they passed us but now i know why were running dark we dont have any tail lights or running lights
9336414 do your hazards work you know your four way flashers do they work
9336415 yeah they work fine what the hell is that gonna do for our running lights and tail lights
9336416 you dont need running lights or tail lights if your four way flashers work just leave those on and get your ass to bristol the other vehicles on the road will be able to see you and youll be safe fix the lights tomorrow when you wake up and its daylight and you can see what you are working on goodnight and dont call me this late again im going back to bed love you son
9336417 your not gonna believe this but the brake pedal is lying on the floor it fell off dude
9336418 i couldnt figure out why all of these kept flashing their lights at us as they passed us but now i know why were running dark we dont have any tail lights or running lights
9336419 do your hazards work you know your four way flashers do they work
9336420 yeah they work fine what the hell is that gonna do for our running lights and tail lights
9336421 you dont need running lights or tail lights if your four way flashers work just leave those on and get your ass to bristol the other vehicles on the road will be able to see you and youll be safe fix the lights tomorrow when you wake up and its daylight and you can see what you are working on goodnight and dont call me this late again im going back to bed love you son
9336422 your not gonna believe this but the brake pedal is lying on the floor it fell off dude
9336423 were new with our new partners boston ventures david zucker our new ceo is doing a great job hes peddling 900 mph trying to get hold of everything
9336424 what weve been missing are a lot of the business decisions that need to be made and a lot of the business connections we need
9336425 our guys are being very strategic in how we do it i have to make a good case for what i think we need to buy and that makes me feel good because i told them before this transaction went down that its not going to happen overnight
9336426 and if it does happen overnight it wont last like bobby ginn last year
9336427 as far as driver lineup for next year we are very aggressive on moving forward but we are facing the fact that based on where our cars are running right now we wont be able to get that a level driver as a teammate with bobby labonte
9336428 were still working on those plans kyle will run some races next year and bobby will have a teammate that we hope can grow into that b level or a level player
9336429 if you look at dodge teams as a whole and i dont feel comfortable saying this but we are the weaker teams
9336430 i was on the other side when i was with rick hendrick and i saw what rick put into it how committed he was and how involved he was in making sure he got the right people in the right places
9336431 i could get going on a tirade about car owners they like to sit in the big meetings and complain about how the manufacturers arent committed but the real commitment starts here at the top
9336432 but weve got to use the money weve got wisely
9336433 everyone is a little up in arms over these test dates for next year well get 24 nascar approved testing days at nascar tour tracks but our team has already tested 30 times this year at non nascar cup tracks like kentucky under the old rules
9336434 they do a nice job of getting us on national television so we can get big sponsors so we just have to use our head count as effectively as possible and get the most out of your folks
9336435 and the question now has to be how long will rick and jack and those guys maintain those head counts
9336436 i think there have probably been conversations among rick and jack and chip and felix sabates and the others
9336437 people who havent been watching their head counts will have to start watching their head counts because the people are very expensive
9336438 when you look at the manufacturers their support is great but when you look at a teams budget the manufacturers part is the smallest piece of the pie
9336439 from where we sit dodge has done everything theyd said theyd do and theyre always offering to do more whether its more seven post computer time or more wind tunnel time
9336440 for all manufacturers the way this sport is today the way the economy is globally we have to look at ways to work together and work smarter with evernham gillett with penske with ganassi and the manufacturers may have to do that too
9336441 youve seen this little world over the years some years this sport looks invincible and other years weve got to tighten our belts
9336442 that is one area we all feel weve been dragging our feet on the development of that engine
9336443 bob nardelli the ex home depot boss who now runs chrysler has been very supportive of us but he cant just come in here and save our program weve got to look in the mirror that goes for every dodge team
9336444 from the financial side you look at roger penske and he is in a position to be every bit as strong as joe gibbs or rick hendrick
9336445 and i know roger cares because hes been to more stock car races than you can imagine
9336446 but at the same it starts at the top and its about getting the people in the right place and letting the organization work
9336447 we dont know whats going to happen with ryans team now david stremme who has been on the sidelines for nearly a year now will likely get that ride and that could be another example of somethings missing
9336448 pettys still clueless about 2009 kyle back for some races
9336449 the information is scanty but they feel its at least as serious as the floods last year
9336450 its an area thats not used to flooding its not flooded for at least 50 years so people are not prepared for it
9336451 there are some areas which are still completely cut off where the water is between 10 15 feet
9336452 the need is definitely more than what the government and a few aid agencies are able to provide
9336453 people on the ground say it is definitely higher than the estimates
9336454 eye witnesses say there are so many people who are missing people are just drowning in the water
9336455 they need shelter and food and right now they the government are not ready for this number of people
9336456 the reach has been widening and more areas are coming under water we are racing against time
9336457 in 15 20 days there will be seven districts that will be affected
9336458 its almost as if its because its happening every year even though its affecting millions of people its not making the news i find that quite sad
9336459 the inspection also showed that many companies had not taken measures to remove flaws revealed during previous checks
9336460 we are in the process of re evaluating our relationship with russia and we are doing that in concert with our international partners
9336461 many pensioners already worrying about whether they can afford to heat their homes this winter will be outraged by news of yet more colossal price hikes
9336462 it is a huge worry that one in three pensioner households are likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of 2008 and many are already feeling forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
9336463 all the major suppliers have increased prices for a second time this year this is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy
9336464 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market
9336465 extremely reluctantly especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much
9336466 peace co operation and mutual assistance with abkhazia and south ossetia
9336467 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
9336468 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
9336469 a step towards further escalation of tensions with russia and the desire to drive the situation into an even worse deadlock
9336470 we hope that common sense will prevail over emotions and that eu leaders will find the strength to reject a one sided assessment of the conflict neither party needs the confrontation towards which some countries are being energetically pushed by the eu
9336471 further sliding to confrontation with russia and attempts to put pressure on us are unacceptable as they can entail irreversible consequences in the military political climate and in stability on the continent
9336472 palin repeatedly professed desire to renew federal funding for bridge to nowhere
9336473 advocate s for access to abortion services and high quality reproductive health care for alaskan women
9336474 we are revising lower our estimates expected residential mortgage and other asset write downs weaker investment banking revenues and lower trading revenues our lehman brothers estimate revisions are the most stark and given the uncertain recovery we have also lowered 2009 estimates
9336475 despite the apparent strength the nato naval group in the black sea is not battle worthy
9336476 if necessary a single missile salvo from the moskva missile cruiser and two or three missile boats would be enough to annihilate the entire group
9336477 we will not strike first and they do not look like people with suicidal tendencies
9336478 this storm will prove to be a worst case scenario for the production region
9336479 the big question for the market is going to be how quickly after gustav passes will the industry be able to recover and get back online
9336480 its time to get our people off the offshore platform
9336481 the untested levees at new orleans will be overwhelmed and may fail
9336482 ill go out to beijing and do what ive been doing all year perform well remain undefeated and hopefully bring back gold its just another sandpit in another country
9336483 im going to keep my hair red for beijing because ive been told thats a lucky colour in china
9336484 in my head i dont even allow the image of being defeated in any competition at any time and that seems to be working for me i refuse to even picture a situation where ill lose
9336485 the way it happened in athens wasnt nice but i dont like to think about it or even talk about it now
9336486 im in a place now where i get rid of all these negative things or thoughts in my mind
9336487 athens was an upset sydney at the first olympics it was a great experience for me ill never forget that managing to finish in the top six was a great achievement athens i was coming off 18 months of injuries so anything i could have done that year would have been a bonus
9336488 i hadnt been jumping that well all that year i did have high hopes of getting a medal but it wasnt meant to be
9336489 in valencia i knew as soon as i landed in the pit i didnt even look back to see if it was a no jump or not i was out of the pit celebrating because you know
9336490 everything seems so slow you have so much time you barely feel like youre hitting the ground as soon as you land in the pit its like yeah that was the one you just feel it its a weird sensation
9336491 we have made some changes technically to how i jump ive been injury free all year which makes a huge difference ive struggled in the past to get to a competition in one piece
9336492 mentally physically spiritually im in a great place right now im not taking on board any kind of negativity and it seems to show
9336493 hopefully this olympics will be third time lucky for me
9336494 i couldnt figure out why all of these kept flashing their lights at us as they passed us but now i know why were running dark we dont have any tail lights or running lights
9336495 do your hazards work you know your four way flashers do they work
9336496 yeah they work fine what the hell is that gonna do for our running lights and tail lights
9336497 you dont need running lights or tail lights if your four way flashers work just leave those on and get your ass to bristol the other vehicles on the road will be able to see you and youll be safe fix the lights tomorrow when you wake up and its daylight and you can see what you are working on goodnight and dont call me this late again im going back to bed love you son
9336498 your not gonna believe this but the brake pedal is lying on the floor it fell off dude
9336499 this is who i am im addicted to the stuff it consumes my mind
9336500 im sick and this is why i had to come up some sort of explanation of what was happening in my body
9336501 i dont know how you can fake vomiting all over yourself night after night after night im not that good an actor
9336502 ive been hiding who i am for so long i can honestly say to you that the last two years have been hell for me physically emotionally but i never sat down and said lets try and fool the world
9336503 i know hes not an evil man theres not evil in his heart
9336504 i know that i love him i know that much
9336505 were just not going to rush anything were gonna walk through the process however slowly it needs to happen in order for the healing and restoration to be complete and then well go from there
9336506 i was the first one he told he confessed everything to me
9336507 he just went through it where it had started everything in his life as a young kid the patterns he was crying sobbing actually absolutely sobbing he just said i dont have cancer
9336508 he was terrified i still remember the look on his face it was a very hard moment for him as it was for me hearing it
9336509 i could just see a really broken unwell man at that point i found it really quite hard to get angry
9336510 seeing your husband of seven years absolutely sobbing in front of you risking everything coming forward and telling the truth in that instance it was really hard to be angry or mad
9336511 i never questioned it when you love someone you trust them i had no reason not to trust him
9336512 perhaps i feel a little bit foolish in this hindsights a fabulous thing but im trying not to beat myself up
9336513 in the middle of the night he was in so much pain i would put towels in the microwave to try and give him some relief in his back
9336514 no ser a conveniente organizar un evento festivo bajo la amenaza de una tragedia terrible como un desastre nacional
9336515 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is gradually leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9336516 it is evident that if such a challenge occurs the fake and artificial regimes will be eliminated before anything
9336517 some of the equipment of our armed forces have been announced but there are important things hidden whose effect would be shown on the day of any attack
9336518 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9336519 you cant be chopping and changing people that often i mean undoubtedly at some stage before the end of parliament he gordon brown will want to do a reshuffle but i am not expecting one imminently
9336520 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9336521 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9336522 gordon brown has briefed out stories that he has an economic recovery plan all worked out meanwhile the chancellor says the downturn will be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9336523 i worry about the government lurching from one extreme to the other
9336524 until very recently there was no problem there was a state of denial britain was the strongest country in the western world any problems we had were from overseas
9336525 now suddenly weve lurched into apocalypse now the return of the great depression
9336526 these are the same difficult economic circumstances that every other country in the world is having to deal with
9336527 but with employment levels near record highs interest rates that are historically low and the past decade of rising incomes and job creation the uk is well placed to deal with this
9336528 it makes good sense to speak honestly particularly if there are going to be some measures that many not be palatable to the electorate
9336529 i am trying to think of another chancellor who has talked things down like this
9336530 i have several tools at my disposal but i am not using any of them because i want to keep things calm i will not quit if you want me out do it by law not by force
9336531 we definitely wont leave the government house until we can topple samaks administration
9336532 he cannot stay on for long i am very sure of that
9336533 just trying to run the best campaign she can and spend as much time as she can in north carolina
9336534 a prime time tv speaking role where she praised president bush
9336535 president bush has restored honor and dignity to the white house
9336536 in this era of rampant cynicism and indifference toward government bush is determined to bring civility to the public square and restore pride in our leaders
9336537 there are too many americans without hope too many street corners where despair reigns too many classrooms where children are being left behind
9336538 plus they think the hurricanes going to hit starts laughing new orleans about the time they start
9336539 i was just thinking this hurricane gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9336540 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
9336541 we high school graduate teens declare that we shall work against the israeli occupation and oppression policy in the occupied territories and the territories of israel therefore we will refuse to take part of these actions which are being done under our name as part of the idf israeli army
9336542 nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance
9336543 the administrations proposal includes not only the broad proclamation of a continued
9336544 reaffirm that for the duration of the conflict the united states may detain as enemy combatants those who have engaged in hostilities or purposefully supported al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations
9336545 this is a big deal for us to have signed
9336546 its our second deal in china but this joint venture will give us an opportunity to really expand our business
9336547 what indian companies and workers bring to the table is definitely very good design and engineering skills as well as management skills
9336548 but these skills are complemented by what the chinese bring to the table
9336549 once you set the systems right and show them what you want they can achieve it in super fast time and you can work on the assumption that its going to work fine
9336550 that wouldnt happen here in india we wouldnt be able to complete a project as quickly as they are able to
9336551 theres no denying that china is cheaper than in india although it does depend what exactly youre looking for
9336552 the individual components can be cheaper by anywhere between 5 to 25 now thats not something to sneeze at
9336553 if you look at the cost of making a tractor around 70 of that is the raw material costs which are rising all the time
9336554 so finding a way to cut costs is one way to manage the higher raw material charges
9336555 i think one needs to have a bit of patience and largeness of heart
9336556 things are not always what they appear to be here in india were very process driven and we operate with very clear procedures
9336557 but in china its not like that they dont mean anything negative by it it is just the way they are
9336558 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9336559 it is uncertain whether congress will take the administration up on its request
9336560 some republicans have already embraced the idea with representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican on the judiciary committee introducing a measure almost identical to the administrations proposal
9336561 recalls a resolution known as the authorization for use of military force passed by congress on sept 14 2001 which authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those responsible for the sept 11 attacks to prevent future strikes that authorization still in effect was initially viewed by many members of congress who voted for it as the go ahead for the administration to invade afghanistan and overthrow the taliban which had given sanctuary to mr bin laden
9336562 but the military authorization became the secret legal basis for some of the administrations most controversial legal tactics including the wiretapping program and that still gnaws at some members of congress
9336563 with the choice of gov palin its the third term of dick cheney
9336564 hes chosen somebody who doesnt believe climate change is man made
9336565 cheneyesque social conservative whos going to satisfy the base john mccain is a prisoner of the right wing not a maverick

9336568 he is under contract so the strength and the rights are with manchester united
9336569 i think weve been pretty clear all along that ronaldo has got a contract until 2012 hes a valuable member of the team and thats the situation
9336570 but were going to go for it all the same i suppose its all about a manner of theirs to let us know clearly that theyre not going to lower the price in any way and that if we want him we have to pay a lot more money
9336571 real madrid have become aware of the declarations by the player and deeply regret their content real madrid would never want to retain a player against his wishes
9336572 i am only thinking of chelsea and want to play there since may i have been trying to renew my contract but they didnt want to know because they were so sure of signing cristiano ronaldo now they havent signed anyone they dont want me to go
9336573 real deplore the way chelseas directors have acted despite knowing perfectly well the decision not to sell the player making statements and even going so far as to sell shirts with the players name on through their official website
9336574 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9336575 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9336576 ill be glad when its over and i hope it doesnt mess up the city too bad
9336577 the friend requests pokes food fights virtual flowers and other miscellaneous facebook crap has become
9336578 shes ready to shut it off due to spam and 20 friend requests a day
9336579 just keeping up with their social networking platforms email groups etc is an obligation and not a pleasure
9336580 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9336581 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9336582 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in
9336583 ill never leave again just being away worrying about it last time id have rather been here
9336584 we have no experience with this kind of a storm and after katrina there is no way we are staying
9336585 it does look like this will be a strong storm
9336586 we look forward to a better day even as we prepare for a threat to come
9336587 this policy will make your loan payments if you die or become disabled and wont you feel better with that peace of mind
9336588 esprimo ferma condanna per questo grave episodio di violenza che secondo le testimonianze delle vittime sembra essere di natura politica
9336589 its ok to let kids know that there are theories out there
9336590 my dad did talk a lot about his theories of evolution
9336591 he would show us fossils and say how old do you think these are
9336592 im not going to pretend i know how all this came to be
9336593 snooping on your neighbours to report recycling infringements sounds like something straight out of the east german stasis copybook
9336594 with council tax so high the last thing people want to pay for is an army of busybodies peering through their net curtains at their neighbours as they put out their rubbish
9336595 volunteers will be involved in reporting issues in their area such as recycling waste fly tipping graffiti dog fouling and abandoned vehicles
9336596 these are all people who care about the environment and they will be ambassadors for their area
9336597 they will be there to report graffiti abandoned vehicles and local vandalism but not to report on other individuals
9336598 and they might go to an over 60s club and talk about recycling
9336599 environment volunteers care passionately about their area and want to protect it
9336600 they are not snoopers they will help councils cut crime and make places cleaner greener and safer
9336601 they are more confident now every time there is a suicide bomb they are on television claiming responsibility they didnt used to do that
9336602 the tribal people are peaceful but if you bomb their lands their families will want revenge
9336603 it is unsafe to say anything against the taliban because they will come and kill you
9336604 the taliban are growing in number and it is quite possible that they could take control of peshawar
9336605 the government could stop them certainly but it is too preoccupied with political infighting
9336606 people still like music but they are afraid for their lives and business is terrible
9336607 no poets will write songs about what is happening to our city
9336608 and even if they did they could not find singers who are brave enough to sing them
9336609 out of five brothers in my town one will support the taliban the people are poor and illiterate and they listen to what the clerics say some of my friends have joined the taliban they pay them for fighting
9336610 we want to be part of pakistan and we want the army to get rid of the taliban
9336611 why didnt they just arrest those taliban why were they bombarding us
9336612 we want peace but we can not have it because of this terrorist america which orders our government to attack its own people
9336613 the taliban are godly people they are islamic and we are happy that they send suicide bombers for revenge
9336614 if it is gods will definitely i will join them now we have to defend our villages and our religion
9336615 hey day hear that black dude osama somethin may be president

9336657 when it happens hizbullah deputy secretary general sheikh naim kassem warned on friday
9336658 why is israel allowed to murder and to assassinate and the world looks away
9336659 we kidnapped the two soldiers in order to release prisoners and not to provoke a war
9336660 when we carried out the operation we didnt think about giving an excuse to israel or not giving an excuse to israel we thought about israel not releasing elderly prisoners and other prisoners
9336661 the next war will be worse than the aggressions of july a reference to the last war with israel
9336662 the mental situation of the israelis is dejected and if the israelis come in they will suffer heavy human losses
9336663 they have no spiritual infrastructure they are shocked when two people are hurt and 28 suffer shock from a missile attack
9336664 israel always prefers that the fighting take place out of its territory
9336665 if the fighting is in its territory you can use pressure and create a balance of fear

9336833 when russia has a grievance over an issue such as south ossetia it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force
9336834 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9336835 that is why i will argue tomorrow that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9336836 we are also reflecting on the nato response we must re evaluate the alliances relationship with russia and intensify our support to georgia and others who may face russian aggression

9336840 im about to start the rain where is the ark
9336841 but things have changed i needed a building permit ive been arguing with the inspector about the need for a sprinkler system my neighbors claim that ive violated the neighborhood zoning laws by building the ark in my yard and exceeding the height limitations we had to go to the development appeal board for a decision then hydro one demanded a bond be posted for the future costs of moving power lines and other overhead obstructions to clear the passage for the arks move to the sea i told them that the sea would be coming to us but they would hear nothing of it getting the wood was another problem theres a ban on cutting local trees in order to save the spotted owl i tried to convince the environmentalists that i needed the wood to save the owls but no go when i started gathering the animals an animal rights group sued me they insisted that i was confining wild animals against their will they argued the accommodation was too restrictive and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined space then the ministry of the environment ruled that i couldnt build the ark until theyd conducted an environmental impact study on your proposed flood im still trying to resolve a complaint with the human rights commission on how many minorities im supposed to hire for my building crew immigration and naturalization are checking the visa status of most of the people who want to work the trades unions say i cant use my sons they insist i have to hire only union workers with ark building experience to make matters worse revenue canada seized all my assets claiming im trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species so forgive me lord but it will take at least 10 years for me to finish this ark

9336858 its been a very long week and i think a lot of misspent energy has been taken up by press the media players everybody
9336859 were expecting news to get to the chairman after the game
9336860 well allow them to conduct their business and hopefully well get the thumbs up and be able to move on fraizer but at this moment in time i dont know
9336861 if i get selected itll be fantastic if i dont i wish the team every success
9336862 in terms of benefiting the team casey would be my first choice because of the four contenders i think hes the best player
9336863 he can be erratic but he hits the ball a country mile and hes a birdie machine he would get points for the team
9336864 id also go for darren because his selection would underline exactly what the wildcard system is designed for
9336865 he is a player who was out of from at the start of the year and did not do enough to qualifying but who had hit form at just the right time
9336866 i thought and was told it would cost the sport support and financial backing but people have come to the conclusion that whatever happened with max was max and it has nothing to do with anything else
9336867 i dont think they care any more people forget all these things at the time it was a shock if it had happened to other people it probably wouldnt have been a shock
9336868 for a short period i said he should resign because i had so much pressure from people to say he should resign
9336869 i have been running for three weeks and im hoping to be playing at the end of october
9336870 if things keep going as well as they have been thats where i will be if it goes well it could be sooner
9336871 were playing in the premier league now were playing against good players and theyll move the ball around easily against 10 men
9336872 our lads kept working and i thought they were smashing
9336873 we are trying to buy new players but the problem is always first of all the availability and also the fact that its finding players who are better or at least as good as the ones we already have
9336874 hell be out for probably ten days to two weeks its the same injury that he got in pre season against wolves
9336875 someone came down on the bottom of his left achilles
9336876 mallorca started better but i think that the first goal was crucial for us
9336877 we improved in the second half and we were superior to our rivals we played much better and we deserved the win
9336878 if you can get guys like charles you need someone to back him up
9336879 i would love the job theres no question about that but you have to weigh up your life
9336880 i was thinking i could do it and i would love the job but its a question if i want it or not
9336881 its special for daniel he has been fantastic since he arrived and he will be remembered long after he has gone
9336882 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9336883 im well supported in terms of my ability to communicate back to the president and back to washington so im comfortable that im not going to lose touch
9336884 a number of the hospitals that originally planned to shelter in place have now decided they are going to actually try to evacuate their critically ill and medical needs patients
9336885 as a consequence weve had to increase the tempo of our air flights into new orleans in order to make sure that we can accommodate the flow were going to be watching this very carefully today
9336886 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9336887 ill be glad when its over and i hope it doesnt mess up the city too bad

9336906 we could have won tonight but coming away from marassi with three points is never easy
9336907 we did well for an hour and then samp began to come out and they put us in difficulty
9336908 its only the first game and so ill take this point without any major dramas
9336909 he was playing awesome hitting the ball so hard and flat
9336910 it was so tough for me to get a rhythm but i felt after the third set the momentum was with me
9336911 my fitness is something ive worked so hard on ideally youd rather not play matches of that length but sometimes it happens youve got to get through it
9336912 the situation has not changed i want to leave real and play for chelsea i am only thinking of chelsea and want to play there
9336913 since may i have been trying to renew my contract but they didnt want to know because they were so sure of signing cristiano ronaldo now they havent signed anyone they dont want me to go
9336914 real president ramon calderon had said that if a good offer came they would let me go chelsea have made a great effort and i dont know what more i can do
9336915 i have told the president the sports director and the coach i want to go i wont refuse to play for real if i stay but if schuster wants to keep a player who is unhappy it is his responsibility
9336916 i want him to stay ive always said so and i stand by what i say he is important for us
9336917 you need to know in what condition a player will arrive and theres been a lot of pressure on him and he isnt in the optimum condition to play hes got too many concerns going on in his head
9336918 i am feeling fine i am feeling really good and my recovery is going well
9336919 i am more than happy with my progress and i hope to be back playing for united by the end of september that is my target and it is a realistic one
9336920 the english said that serie a is retirement ground do you want to know what i think i thought the italians would give me an answer
9336921 however if you want me to wave the italian flag i will i am with italy on this one
9336922 the chairman dave whelan spoke to me recently about my future and he said that until i came up to him and told him i wanted to go then he wouldnt entertain any bids
9336923 i saw nasri slice down joey and thats what i was so upset about
9336924 if it had been the other way round im sure joey would have been sent off joey came on and got a very good tackle in on nasri then he tripped joey when he was running back
9336925 i like nasri and we talked about bringing him to newcastle but he cant do that
9336926 its not as if we are asking for any money for smertin
9336927 the more time goes on the less likely it is ill be able to complete the move but never say never in football
9336928 if there was a chance then obviously id love to come to roma it is a lifelong dream as i am a roma fan from the city
9336929 id have no problem coming there to be fourth choice seeing as at torino there are already four forwards for three places
9336930 michael will put pen to paper over the next 24 hours
9336931 there is a dialogue between the two owners on a regular basis and they have been supportive throughout the last six months especially in the transfer market
9336932 i want him to stay ive always said so and i stand by what i say he is important for us
9336933 you need to know in what condition a player will arrive and theres been a lot of pressure on him and he isnt in the optimum condition to play hes got too many concerns going on in his head
9336934 i want him to stay ive always said so and i stand by what i say he is important for us
9336935 you need to know in what condition a player will arrive and theres been a lot of pressure on him and he isnt in the optimum condition to play hes got too many concerns going on in his head

9336944 itd been a long year and a half of waiting im happy ive finally made it
9336945 im bringing in my work ethic and hopefully i can help the team get wins
9336946 definitely our lineup has improved the positions were lacking talents in have been filled up
9336947 now weve got a new team first were younger second more versatile and third and most important weve got a number of veterans it means were competitive at the present while also looking good in the future
9336948 weve got four new players theyll all be signed up and all will play thats the plan
9336949 to become a much better boxer than he is now
9336950 positive genius for making offhand cutting remarks that couldnt have been sharper if hed honed them a week in his mind oscar was always good for a bright response edged with acid
9336951 now that marilyn monroe is kosher arthur miller can eat her
9336952 theres absolutely nothing wrong with oscar levant that a miracle cant fix
9336953 roses are red violets are blue i am schizophrenic and so am i
9336954 i used to call audrey hepburn a walking x ray
9336955 a few years ago someone suggested that i read spinoza the first chapter in this particular volume was about superstitions and rituals here was my faith spinoza said rituals are all based on fear my faith destroyed i put down the book
9336956 not long ago a well known hollywood savings and loan millionaire intruded on a conversation at my table at a restaurant worst still he implied that he and i were equals compared to you im a habsburg i told him but it didnt offend him he thought habsburg was a rival local banker
9336957 what the world needs is more geniuses with humility there are so few of us left
9336958 im a concert pianist thats a pretentious way of saying im unemployed at the moment
9336959 i have one thing to say about psychoanalysis fuck dr freud
9336960 the only difference between the democrats and the republicans is that the democrats allow the poor to be corrupt too
9336961 everyone in hollywood is gay except gabby hayes and thats because he is a transvestite

9336968 to become a much better boxer than he is now
9336969 hindi ko maintindihan kung bakit si press secretary jesus dureza mismo nagsasabi walang ceasefire for ramadan dahil pini penalize nila ay ang communities na hindi maaring magkakaroon ng peace of mind for ramadan when theres fighting
9336970 act with reason justice and compassion in looking for lasting solutions to the problem
9336971 to find ways to address the grievances of muslim filipinos and to attain the elusive goal of enduring peace
9336972 remain firmly committed to the peace effort while taking the necessary steps to bring back law and order and normalcy particularly by running after rogue rebel elements
9336973 questions of constitutionality and rationality that have hounded the agreement on ancestral domain do not spell the end the peace process for if there are those who had called attention to the infirmities in the agreement it is not because they are against the peace talks they only wanted to make sure that any peace accord would pass the test of credibility and legitimacy
9336974 when i saw lebanon win i instructed the boys to give it just the right amount of effort to get the victory because they will have a big game tomorrow against a strong korea squad
9336975 overall they played decently and stuck to our plans and strategies giving more focus and concentration this time
9336976 to become a much better boxer than he is now
9336977 to become a much better boxer than he is now
9336978 my initial reaction when i heard about mannys fight against oscar was to get scared because i dont want to see him get seriously hurt
9336979 then when i started to read more about peoples comments and analysis on the issues i had mixed feelings about it im inclined to pay attention to the analysis of freddie roach who trained oscar for floyd mayweather
9336980 the few times i heard manny talk about it i looked into his eyes as i listened to his remarks like i will fight de la hoya you dont win a fight with height i was 147 in my last fight anyway
9336981 i noticed mannys confidence its like he knows exactly what to do to win his confidence calmed me down a little bit but of course like in all his fights i pray so hard that no one gets badly hurt in the ring i think what manny should do to win is to spend more time in training more dedication than ever and more focus focus on god in what hes doing and in his abilities
9336982 but the lord says by their fruits you shall know them
9336983 people who are much closer to manny and observe his lifestyle day in day out are the ones who can see and have a say about the changes in his life as a christian and catholic honestly from what i have observed of manny and heard from some of those people closer to him there are special and good traits that lead one to say that he is maturing as a person and becoming a more devout catholic that should sound good music to all of us
9336984 there is always room for everyone to improve and grow so my advice to manny is to grow in his relationship with god which in turn will lead him to grow in his relationship with his family and others
9336985 please continue to be aware that god has blessed you abundantly including with a heart that can truly love god back and honor him by loving others especially the needy and less privileged
9336986 the longer or older he fights the more possibilities of getting hit perhaps with some telling blows
9336987 i see a future for manny in philippine politics when he retires but i believe he has to endure a lot of different moments considering he wants to be someone who can truly make a difference in the lives of our countrymen through effective and good and honest governance
9336988 one wonders how many people around him when he tries again to enter politics will have the same honest to goodness motivations
9336989 perhaps to be successful in this not so impossible mission manny might carefully consider doing first his homework which includes praying more to god asking for enlightenment consultations with his family and people of different backgrounds and professions observing and studying the ins and outs of politics the situations or conditions of his constituents and livelihood programs of government to help them and to improve their quality of life i hope and pray that god may grant him the true light as he decides on this issue as well as the strength to follow that light
9336990 its not easy for me to be out of my religious community
9336991 but good thing im able to celebrate mass for manny either with a special permission from my superiors or coinciding with my vacation i celebrated mass before and after mannys last two fights against erik morales his fight against jorge solis in san antonio his rematches against marco antonio barrera and juan manuel marquez and his fight against diaz the masses were held on saturday morning before the fight and the sunday morning after

9337195 this is what ive always wanted to photograph ever since i bought this camera
9337196 to both shut down the republican national convention and actually harm the officers that are working this convention
9337197 the welcoming committee is a criminal enterprise made up of 35 anarchists who are intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9337198 these acts include tactics to blockade and disable delegate buses breaching venue security and injuring police officers they have recruited assistance in their criminal conspiracy from other anarchists groups throughout the country through their plans and actions they have exhibited a blatant disregard for the law and the safety of others
9337199 we didnt want to have the game game gummed up with a story line
9337200 we wanted to keep it really clean and tight a zombie apocalypse
9337201 its about killing zombies not some fable on the reconstruction of humanity
9337202 youre gong to play a map 50 to 100 times so we can be more subtle

9337205 a game like endwar for example which you can control by voice its totally changing the industry because it gives you the opportunity to command whats happening and to have a quick answer to the orders you give
9337206 and its the same for a lot of other games like the party games you can play the games with guitars are also helping things to increase the fun and bring more people because when you have fun with your family on the game you take them into more games with you
9337207 what does one do when confronted by evil or hateful behavior
9337208 there is only one soul ution you hold it in your very soul you love it you love it so fully so powerfully so passionately it weeps it falls to its knees and weeps and it is released as the hardened heart breakith it is released from its eternal self made hell

9337210 god why are you not helping me why do you just sit there and allow this pain suffering and confusion of my true path in life did you forsake me did you forget about me why did you stop paddling
9337211 i only stopped rowing because when you picked up the oars you rowed against the current of life against me so i gradually put my paddles down giving you free will until you tired of your own journey and allowed me to pick back up the oars and steer you in the direction of your divine soul purpose are you ready yet
9337212 it is time to open your heart it is time to come from the place of grace and humility that can only come from the divine heart the sacred heart you can no longer come from the understanding of the mind are you willing

9337235 building this clinic represents an important expansion in abbotts commitment to improving access to care for children in the developing world during the last decade
9337236 it fulfills a critical need in tanzania where we have been improving health systems not only for people with hiv but also for those with other chronic health issues as well
9337237 while we are making progress in enrolling adults into hiv care and treatment our services for children have severely lagged behind due to lack of trained physicians and other necessary resources
9337238 we expect the new center of excellence to accelerate our ability to make progress against our national treatment goals for children with hiv
9337239 the mbeya center of excellence will provide the foundation for pediatric hiv treatment for the foreseeable future helping not only to save childrens lives but increase health care worker capacity in the country
9337240 we are confident that we will see the profound improvements in childrens health in mbeya that we have seen across africa when integrating pediatric hiv clinics into national aids programs
9337241 say you dont need no diamond rings and ill be satisfied

9337243 sunday august 31 some reaction to the reaction to the cuts
9337244 what a racist thing of you to say you racist bigot
9337245 much evidence points to racial prejudice as a factor that could be large enough to cost obama the election

9337250 the transcend study demonstrates the value of telmisartan in people who are unable to tolerate angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
9337251 although the benefit is of moderate size there is an impact on a range of outcomes including the composite of cardiovascular death myocardial infarction and strokes as well as cardiovascular hospitalizations given the large proportion of people who are unable to tolerate an ace inhibitor the use of telmisartan would be clinically important
9337252 the remarkable tolerability of telmisartan is emphasized by the fact that fewer individuals stop medication if they were receiving telmisartan compared to placebo
9337253 this is particularly noteworthy as all the individuals enrolled in the study were unable to tolerate an ace inhibitor which is a closely related class of agents
9337254 in 2000 we elected a president who claimed he believed god created the earth and who as president put car manufacturers and oil companys interests ahead of caring for that creation
9337255 today when i listen to obama speak and to his remarkable wife michelle what i hear is a world view that actually nurtures life obama is trying to lead this country to a place where the intrinsic worth of each individual is celebrated a leader who believes in hope the future trying to save our planet and providing a just and good life for everyone is someone who is actually pro life
9337256 the real solution to abortion is to change the heart of america not the law we need to stop seeing ourselves as consumers we need to stop seeing ourselves as
9337257 any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love but to use any violence to get what they want this is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion
9337258 i really hope the american people will have their eyes wide open and choose to be discerning he is extreme extreme extreme
9337259 see i have prepared my dinner my oxen and fatted cattle are killed and all things are ready
9337260 alleluia salvation and glory and honor and power belong to the lord our god for true and righteous are his judgments because he has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants shed by her

9337262 alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigns let us be glad and rejoice and give him glory for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready
9337263 the procession came winding its way back as usual to the church and at the end walked the archbishop of rheims carrying the blessed sacrament
9337264 i had no sudden pain that i can recall and certainly had no vision
9337265 they had me in a small ward on the ground floor
9337266 the effect of the hypos began to wear off during the night but i had no full realization that i was cured i was awake for most of the night no lights were on
9337267 the chimes of the big basilica rang the hours and half hours as usual through the night playing the air of the lourdes ave maria
9337268 dr marley was outside the door when he saw the man over whom he had been watching during the pilgrimage and whose death he had expected push two brancardiers aside and run out of the ward he fell back in amazement out in the open now i ran toward the grotto which is about two or three hundred yards from the aisle this stretch of ground was graveled then not paved and i was barefoot i ran the whole way to the grotto without getting the least mark or cut on my bare feet the brancardiers were running after me but they could not catch up with me when they reached the grotto there i was on my knees still in my night clothes praying to our lady and thanking her all i knew was that i should thank her and the grotto was the place to do it the brancardiers stood back afraid to touch me
9337269 yes mr cunningham quite all right are you feeling all right
9337270 theyre there jack because they are glad to see you
9337271 well its nice of them and im glad to see them but i wish theyd leave me alone
9337272 john do you realize how ill you have been and that you have been miraculously cured by the blessed virgin
9337273 everything came back to me the memory of my years of illness and the sufferings of the journey to lourdes and how ill i had been in lourdes itself i began to cry and the archbishop began to cry and we both sat there crying like two children after a little talk with him i felt composed now i realized fully what had happened
9337274 why the new testament authors expected the world to come to an end and it didnt so they were wrong
9337275 the beast that you saw was and is not and is about to come up out of the abyss

9337286 they will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations
9337287 outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood
9337288 from any tree of the garden you may eat freely but from the tree singular of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die
9337289 taiwan is our top pick market in fact its been our third market in asia all year
9337290 it asia is the most oversold market since post september 11 in 2001
9337291 after many years of de rating this sector of de rating taiwans market there may be a tech rotation globally away from the energy sector toward technologies and taiwan should be a beneficiary of that
9337292 i think it is time for the prime minister to look at himself and decide whether he is still fit to be prime minister
9337293 if he still holds onto office the problems of the country will escalate
9337294 aggressive behavior is my nature it is not indecent behavior
9337295 i did not do anything wrong and have the right to continue my work as prime minister
9337296 since the government cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9337297 the event is a fun gathering for swim clubs from around the country people display the banners of their swim clubs it is fun to watch and to be in

9337300 everyone knows that awarding these positions is seen as rewards or favors for the presidents supporters so the presidential office should seriously revise the system of appointing presidential advisers and national policy advisers and consider canceling it
9337301 and if the presidential office allocates such a budget in the governments fiscal 2009 budget statement the legislature should block it
9337302 the amount of garbage our trash trucks collect is about 77 percent of what we collected in 2003 and some of the routes are too close
9337303 the amount of garbage our trash trucks collect is about 77 percent of what we collected in 2003 and some of the routes are too close its time to rearrange those routes
9337304 shes had 12 years of elected office experience including traveling to kuwait including being involved in these issues im so proud that she has displayed the kind of judgment and she has the experience and judgment as an executive
9337305 the government in moscow deserves criticism for its behavior but that doesnt change the fact that security and stability in europe can only be achieved with and not against russia
9337306 thus europe would only be hurting itself if we were to get full of emotion and slam all the doors shut to the rooms that we will want to enter afterwards
9337307 the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9337308 we trust the wisdom and the courage of the european union to undertake the best available steps for that
9337309 i hope the initiative for an eastern partnership will gain new momentum now after the tragic events of recent weeks
9337310 the eu is not in a position to throw russia out from anywhere any attempt to isolate russia would not only be short sighted but unrealistic
9337311 shes a nice filly and seamie gave her a great ride
9337312 i was very concerned this run may have come a bit too quickly for her but she did it really nicely
9337313 shes really a horse for next year because shes still big and weak shes going to make an exciting three year old i feel sorry for wayne lordan who does all her home work and is suspended but seamies the super sub
9337314 she did it well and the prix marcel boussac at longchamp october 5th is now a possibility she is not entered in the other big races so that would be the plan at the moment
9337315 shes been fearfully unlucky but she loves the curragh and i told the owners that i really fancied her the ball hasnt been bouncing for me though so they backed her and i didnt
9337316 it was one gentleman who was in new orleans who has moved on now to atlanta out of the way of hurricane gustav
9337317 the consulate in chicago and our consulate services here are ready to assist anyone that needs it
9337318 irish citizens currently living in or visiting the gulf coast area or who expect to be in the region should pay attention to news reports and in the event of difficulties developing follow the instructions of the local emergency services
9337319 irish citizens in the region should keep in contact with their families at home and are also encouraged to register their whereabouts and contact details on the department of foreign affairs website so that they can be contacted in the event of an emergency
9337320 it is not realistic to expect that theres a quick fix or a shortcut we wont solve the conflict issues on the table in two or three weeks
9337321 we have to complete the annapolis process this year this year
9337322 we must fight the urge to postpone everything until copenhagen surely we can make concrete progress on some issues
9337323 i would emphasise the need to make the most of the upcoming opportunity in poznan
9337324 it is my sincere hope that by the end of this year in poznan parties to the climate change convention will have achieved a better understanding of a shared vision for long term cooperative action
9337325 i got stress with my host parents because i came home totally drunk
9337326 ilan county has been working hard to promote tourism has beautiful scenery and people and has passed the relevant government agency assessments so we have decided that ilan will host next years festival
9337327 we are hoping to have a quick unfolding of this investigation so we can basically reconcile these numbers which are way too far apart right now
9337328 it is obviously a case where all three have received different bits of information and they need to reconcile this
9337329 obviously there is somebody that does not have the right information
9337330 any kind of militant action will be responded to with full force
9337331 its a joke it isnt a matter of holy or unholy all months are holy if they want to end fighting it should be permanent
9337332 we want enforcement of shariah laws and will continue our struggle we havent got instructions from our top leadership to stop fighting if they do order a halt then we certainly will
9337333 the mps can see the trend among the people who are demanding change
9337334 thats why they are keen to support a party that is fair to all races
9337335 i am confident and believe that all the trials we are facing today can be overcome if we remain united and work together with firm determination
9337336 a united people is the countrys strongest line of defense in facing any situation both internally and externally
9337337 no one citizen is recognized as being of a higher position than another in this nation this nation belongs to all of us whether we rise or fall depends on all of us
9337338 we want to block the traffic so the government will hear our voice if we just sit back and do nothing the government will also do nothing
9337339 if i had known i would never have bought a home here
9337340 we pay a lot of attention to the residents concerns
9337341 on hot days the buried garbage gives off a bad odor but we are doing what we can
9337342 in the evening a much bigger group of over 1 000 people fired in the air and warned us to leave if we wanted to stay alive
9337343 i had a home and a tractor i reared goats and hens now i have nothing
9337344 they are living without food or drink and even there they are being hunted down by these people i have spoken to nuns and priests who are hiding in the forests
9337345 they said that it was a horrifying experience groups arrived at their villages carrying guns swords and homemade weapons and even small bombs which they used to blast the places the groups targeted every christian house in their villages the people had a list of the christian houses and institutions and none were spared
9337346 it is the result of a sustained hate campaign against christians in orissa
9337347 the shrine board will now exclusively use the land during the pilgrimage period
9337348 we are suspending the agitation for now as our main demand has been met
9337349 the proprietary status ownership and title of the land shall not undergo any change
9337350 you only have to look at the intensity of the conflict in and around the park to understand this is a daunting challenge
9337351 the few who go in cant find them in the upper slopes any more we hear and sometimes see the fighting we dont know if the gorillas are in the middle or in the outer edges
9337352 despite the fighting we are as determined as ever to get back in
9337353 it is critical that we know the status of the mountain gorillas the more cut off we are from them the less chance we have of securing their survival
9337354 the democratic republic of congo is emerging from one of the most traumatic wars since the second world war all of its institutions including the judicial system are very frail very fragile millions of innocent civilians have died what has happened to the gorillas is a terrible tragedy but it is in the context of something thats even worse
9337355 what has driven the war in eastern congo is the pillaging of natural resources and be it the forests be it the minerals its the richest country in the world with the poorest people
9337356 it was buried by the governments decision not to sign the ancestral domain agreement
9337357 were not only disappointed and frustrated over the governments decision to turn its back on the ancestral domain deal weve completely lost trust and confidence in them the fate of the peace negotiation rests solely in the hands of the government
9337358 it turns out that we dont see or feel any pluses from membership and if there are some we still carry a burden
9337359 to put it simply we have been cheated because a country really fulfilling its obligations should not have to wait so long to join the world trade organization
9337360 we are not going to change our manner of negotiating
9337361 some of our partners might like to freeze the process but we want to carry on
9337362 this doesnt mean we should renounce our strategic course towards the wto but there should be some clarifications on this question elementary fairness should prevail
9337363 unless we see progress on that issue we cannot sign off on russias application for the wto
9337364 it would appear that bryans may be taking part in unofficial discussions for the benefit of troops under the auspices of education officer
9337365 bryans idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts
9337366 that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world
9337367 i am not sure that this is a very desirable point of view to publish at the present time
9337368 bryans is a talkative and indiscreet fellow who is in possession of a story which he delights in telling and which if told publicly would be likely to cause embarrassment to the foreign office
9337369 he went to italy with the knowledge of the foreign office in order to develop his contacts he greatly exceeded his instructions
9337370 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities afforded him to go to italy
9337371 it is my duty as a head of government to express to you in the name of the italian people our regret and apologies for the deep wounds that we have caused you
9337372 the accord will provide for us 200 million a year over the next 25 years through investments in infrastructure projects in libya
9337373 this agreement should put an end to 40 years of discord it is a concrete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era
9337374 this is an historic moment when two brave men acknowledge the defeat of colonialism
9337375 the libyan people endured injustice and were attacked in their homes and they deserve an apology and compensation
9337376 a sudden burst of dignity humanity and respect so as to finally give satisfaction to the 20 000 italian citizens who are still waiting for fair compensation from their government
9337377 we can no longer live we cant be safe anywhere
9337378 i hope those in government do their jobs otherwise they should resign
9337379 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9337380 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9337381 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9337382 as military strategy must correspond to national policy the military has no say in this regard as it is part of the overall game plan
9337383 this is a historic moment because this is the first time anyone has invited so many people to evaluate lawmakers
9337384 the constitution stipulates that anyone over 20 is entitled to vote
9337385 but our rights and responsibility do not end at the ballot box instead we should monitor those weve chosen to represent our voices
9337386 awards will be presented to the best performing legislators on each committee in public and we hope those with the lowest rankings will try to improve
9337387 the other 40 percent will be based on a legislators number of legislative proposals whether he or she has any outstanding attributes has proposed any sunshine bills violated any legislative regulations been indicted or made any legislative proposals that could benefit a particular group of people
9337388 attendance the number of proposals and how many times a legislator spoke during the past legislative session decide a large percentage of the final grade he or she receives
9337389 but we dont know whether a lawmaker actually sat through the meeting or left right after signing the attendance roll or what he or she said at the meeting
9337390 based on the limited information we can only give the best grade to those who dont act inappropriately and not to those who actually perform the job well
9337391 the differences on the core issues are still very wide
9337392 the differences on the core issues are still very wide
9337393 there isnt enough food for animals to graze and there are water shortages for the population
9337394 the panorama doesnt look like its going to get better
9337395 the drought is wreaking havoc and government help is minimal
9337396 a warm ocean surface can provide the heat source needed to drive intense oceanic lightning with very high peak currents which usually generate elves in the ionosphere
9337397 elves could have an important global effect on the lower ionosphere and the total electron content
9337398 elf hotspots may increase the electron density of the ionosphere by 5 percent or more which could interfere with ground and space communication as well as navigation systems
9337399 thats more money than we raised in the fourth quarter of 2007
9337400 we did not go to help them to build capacity
9337401 we went to understand them better and to have them understand us
9337402 were not sitting here planning to contain china were not sitting here dying to pick a fight with china we basically are an armed force in a democratic society who will fight if must but prefer not to and well support american interests if we have to but dont mess with us
9337403 we are very aware in our program of not giving away more than we get from these exchanges were not doing it to be nice guys were doing it to get our job done of teaching the chinese what sort of capability we have out there
9337404 low education levels in the pla negatively affect its operating capability and professionalism
9337405 very few stray questions they had a good idea of why we were there
9337406 the chinese do not yet understand the role of the senior nco in the us military service
9337407 they did not understand that a chief master sergeant as the senior enlisted leader of the pacific command is not a commander
9337408 the main problem we face is a lack of equipment that detects explosives
9337409 sometimes you go through times in the year where youre not very good and then you go through times where you are good
9337410 the last couple of days i got on base every time its just one of those things
9337411 i dont care what your age is getting runs is good
9337412 but he did a good job after we got the runs
9337413 what hes done to come back and to win a ball game like that is just huge for him huge for us and huge for the city
9337414 oddly enough listening to britney does not make you sleepy
9337415 oddly enough listening to britney does not make you sleepy
9337416 im enjoying the challenge and im delighted to still have a sniff ollies favorite but ill see if i can make him sweat a bit
9337417 im enjoying the challenge and im delighted to still have a sniff
9337418 ollies favorite but ill see if i can make him sweat a bit
9337419 the culmination of a years worth of golf comes down to one day i played wonderfully and made nothing the longest putt was the five footer on the last
9337420 i played like eight or nine under golf not four under i needed a good score to keep the dream alive and i achieved that but i need a great one tomorrow sunday
9337421 deforestation has to fall more and the conditions for sustainable development have to improve
9337422 for a while there was certainly a chance of 59
9337423 although i had 59 on my mind once i made that second eagle it didnt affect my golf i hit a couple of bad tee shots coming in but i certainly hit a few good shots
9337424 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie and then on my back nine a couple of eagles really boosted the round
9337425 at the start of the day i just wanted to make the cut to make sure i got into next week
9337426 i got off to a good start and it snowballed from there im disappointed about the 59 but im certainly not disappointed
9337427 it wasnt a great start but theres lots of golf to be played and i just kept telling myself that
9337428 oddly enough listening to britney does not make you sleepy
9337429 i had a few runner up finishes which is nice financially but there is nothing like winning a tournament it is truly satisfying
9337430 i was solid on the back nine i was thinking that if i shot a six under today ill be happy no matter what the outcome even if i had not won
9337431 my iron play was good so i thought i could be aggressive on the 15th hole i was too fast off the tee and the ball found the water but a good game by scott
9337432 it was a bad round i was pressing for a win it was my real chance to win without having to do anything spectacular as all i had to do was shoot a two under
9337433 if you know both yourself and your enemy you need not fear the results of a hundred battles with more calculations one can win with less one cannot
9337434 if you know your own defects and learn from your enemys advantages you will win
9337435 today i served very well i have more confidence and i hope to continue to improve my tennis i know i have to keep improving my tennis if i want to win
9337436 i still cant believe it i felt happy and more positive thats why i felt i could fight through
9337437 im not surprised im sure he will be a very good player
9337438 i really didnt get any rhythm i just kept fighting this is why you put in all the work hopefully i can keep it going
9337439 that gave me a lot of confidence that i could win
9337440 he was playing well in that moment but after that i started playing better and he made some mistakes
9337441 ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9337442 i can go out there and rip away i have nothing to lose
9337443 im definitely not at my best but i hope to get there
9337444 oddly enough listening to britney does not make you sleepy
9337445 at no moment did spanair indicate that it was its intention to substitute the plane
9337446 informed the airport of the possibility of replacing the aircraft
9337447 the children are about to go back to school like thousands of others in austria
9337448 with a green mp sitting in the house of commons it will now be impossible to exclude the green party from the televised leaders debates in the next election
9337449 i believe in our quality and i think we got our fans back with this performance
9337450 when we all play together like that and show our spirit we have a chance to win it was very important to show that if we play like this we have a lot of chances to win something
9337451 ive been around long enough to know that when the vultures are around it gets difficult
9337452 ive never had it before but you just have to deal with it id rather it was directed at me than the players
9337453 the goals were two excellent bits of skill from a top class striker we worked hard on our system all week and getting this result should give the players a lot of belief
9337454 not least with russias rapid recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia it puts into question one of the fundamental assumptions of the post cold war era you dont change borders or at least you dont if youre one of the key stakeholders
9337455 the widely held view among people who think about these things in europe as well as washington was that russia was determined to respect borders at the ending of the soviet union that is the major change
9337456 has entered a new 19th century vaporizing the end of history sentiment that shaped european politics in the 1990s and replacing it with an older geopolitical calculus in a modern form
9337457 the georgia crisis is not unique in itself it has simply been the event that wakes people up to what has been already happening i think that many leaders in the west failed to acknowledge what was happening i liken it to a financial bubble and the implicit assumption was that russia was weak
9337458 we considered multiple models for russia except for the outcome where russia became strong and bad as defined in our terms which means like us no one considered this outcome because no one imagined oil at over us 100 a barrel
9337459 russia in the 1990s was close to being a non entity survival as a grand power was an issue
9337460 that push was counter productive and largely responsible for what is happening today if we push harder
9337461 it will confirm russias worst fear over what nato is about that is what i am afraid of by pushing ever harder we end up in a dangerous place
9337462 we are on the verge of a new cold war
9337463 it seems like a cold war i can only hope it will not be so deep
9337464 it is not just that the west and the eu has been losing influence because of mistakes made in places like iraq
9337465 russia has contributed to what is happening too by being too cocky in trying to restore its position in the world too quickly not so long ago we were almost a failed state now we are one of the worlds three big powers again
9337466 it is serious but it is neither fatal nor tragic it is serious because russia is going through a post imperial crisis of leadership inspired by post imperial nostalgia it is not tragic or fatal because russia is not the soviet union it is vulnerable as the flight of capital from its stock market has already shown
9337467 the difference between stalin and putin is that stalin committed great crimes on a great scale putin has committed petty crimes on a petty scale and what is certain is that russias new business elite is not going to be happy if they think their bank accounts could be frozen or their children cannot study in the west
9337468 we showed the valencia of last year that finished 10th in the league is a thing of the past
9337469 the club wanted to keep me and i feel comfortable here so it is all fine it is just nice to get back to scoring goals
9337470 the team did well and we won so i am happy although we suffered far too much in the final few minutes
9337471 it was a nice victory for the whole team particularly since i am leaving at the end of the season they were nice enough to let me have it
9337472 we are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with spartak moscow for the transfer of roman pavlyuchenko to the club
9337473 i made the decision hes under pressure from his entourage and not fit to play
9337474 the result was fair because we werent able to close out the match but a draw at a difficult ground is not a big drama
9337475 i expressed my transfer desires several months ago but with respect to the club if the decision to not bring them is taken it will come from the president massimo moratti
9337476 heavy dependence on exports leaves taiwan ill equipped in coping with surging fuel and raw material costs that are eroding corporate profits and the nations economic performance
9337477 these are diversionary tactics to avoid a decision its not a question of negotiating teams its a matter of do you want it or dont you
9337478 they are avoiding the issue they dont want a status of forces agreement they dont want a security agreement
9337479 people gave the impression we were close when rice was here but its not over
9337480 we would have a serious problem if we took it to parliament right now
9337481 these welcome signs indicate that the economic stimulus package that i signed earlier this year is having its intended effect
9337482 that was not a great game but we showed plenty of character
9337483 we showed good organization in defense and could have won 2 0
9337484 we knew before the game we were playing a top side we simply made too many errors
9337485 we were a bit naive in conceding the goals early on but i didnt worry
9337486 we created so much pressure in the second half that the goals simply had to come
9337487 they fought very aggressively and worked hard those were all things which were missing to us we have taken an enormous step backwards as a result
9337488 i just tried to play to my very best at 2 0 we started to play at a lower standard i think we were a bit scared and could have finished the match better
9337489 i admire horaus defensive play and he gave us a precious lift with the set pieces
9337490 buy this product and you will get this clear benefit
9337491 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9337492 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9337493 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9337494 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9337495 im on the edge of something and it would be so much easier to explain if i had overcome heroin addiction or had some other radical change in my life
9337496 my growth as an artist and a person has been so slow and gradual its hard to make a story out of it
9337497 im not trying to settle any scores my intention wasnt to hurt or expose anyone but just tell the truth about my life
9337498 i told her if you make a record thats a leap you may have a chance to reinvigorate your career or lets go out with a bang my agenda was to do something much more refined something groovy and evocative and bring out what i thought was a beautiful textured voice which had been buried in a rock guitar pastiche or because juliana wouldnt sing out
9337499 the rejection doesnt make me second guess myself anymore i know its a good album and i got really good feedback and i realize that the music industry is sort of falling apart so i was able to not take it so personally
9337500 i say ive made peace but its like i dont want to admit that theres still a part of me that still doesnt understand why i dont get much notice
9337501 i dont want to seem like im complaining up until now i thought im cool with everything im an artist man i dont care if people buy my records but i wonder why i dont get much recognition
9337502 he has proven himself yet again ready on day one to shoot from the hip
9337503 there is an opportunity to take the company and break it up and make much much more by selling off the parts
9337504 our analysis shows that both fannie and freddie should have sufficient capital through at least year end 2008 under a variety of negative credit scenarios all parties could wait it out until market conditions calm
9337505 many questions can be asked about the implications of a fannie and freddie bailout for equity markets in general and financial stocks in particular or how it would affect us growth inflation the budget deficit bond yields and currency
9337506 under few of the possible scenarios though do fannie and freddie return to their former clout within the marketplace
9337507 a song or two from her recently released third album
9337508 amy winehouse should have arrived on the site early friday evening we were told by her agent at 8pm that she wasnt coming
9337509 just have a little cake with my children and watch some cartoons
9337510 very wise and sage but at the same time very young
9337511 it is not an indication of any health problems it is an effort to be unseen
9337512 i knew this was the film i had been looking to direct following love you more
9337513 the women in johns early life truly shaped who he became and the strengths and weaknesses of their relationships are central to this film
9337514 will explore all possible countermeasures in cooperation with the south korean government to make the japanese government completely revoke the punitive tariffs at an early date
9337515 will ask the south korean government to take immediate countermeasures including the consideration of retaliatory trade measures against japanese products

9337517 then obama laughing yes she actually made decisions she vetoed she took on reform big oil obama talked
9337518 palin guns babies jesus contrast that to obamas bitter clingers obama just lost blue collar white democratic voters in pennsylvania and other states
9337519 the disgust and the anger with what the democrats at the top of this party and state are doing is whats going to offset the obama factor
9337520 how stupid do the repubs think the clinton supporters are it is the dems who think we are stupid and have treated us that way how did i ever vote for him

9337522 understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution
9337523 thank you for all the generous advance coverage when i actually do something well let you know
9337524 so that america is once more the last best hope for
9337525 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9337526 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9337527 they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them
9337528 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us
9337529 looking forward the company will continue developing the core business
9337530 we will be very careful about new investments in non core businesses we will only invest in businesses that will bring profit to the company
9337531 we believe the personnel change will have a positive impact on the company in the next few years as lu will make more effort on the core business
9337532 chunghwa telecom has used too many resources investing in non core businesses
9337533 i think the company has a chance to grow in revenues next year
9337534 this is a dream there is nothing like this in the world
9337535 mr jobs called me this is steve jobs he began you think im an arrogant expletive who thinks hes above the law and i think youre a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong he went on to say that he would give me some details about his recent health problems but only if i would agree to keep them off the record
9337536 it occurred to me that i had just been handed by mr jobs himself the very information he was refusing to share with the shareholders who have entrusted him with their money you would think hed want them to know before me but apparently not
9337537 en el c rculo de los que cada d a agravan la situaci n en la naci n dominicana
9337538 en cambio en este pa s la que suple el sistema m s la generada por la empresa ronda los 30 centavos de d lar
9337539 si es real lo que vi en la prensa de que en rep blica dominicana el 80 por ciento de la energ a el ctrica depende del petr leo mientras en china s lo depende un 20 entonces hay que concluir en que tenemos un gran problema de la generaci n de la energ a el ctrica que apunta a agravarse en vez de mejorarse
9337540 si los contratos acuerdos de madrid no son favorables al pa s entonces deben renegociarse responsablemente y paralelo a eso hay que buscar una forma de generaci n transparente para mejorar el sistema el ctrico eso debe hacerse si es que el sistema en que se basan las plantas generadoras es ineficiente
9337541 siempre hablamos de la libre competencia si el sistema no ha funcionado entonces falta otro que funcione eso s que sean transparentes rentables y competitivos la p lvora no hay que inventarla dos veces
9337542 keep smiling keep shining knowing you can always count on me
9337543 it was when him and sammy toured together what is that four years ago now
9337544 most nights sammy and i would pound on his door and say come on out and numerous times invited him to come out onstage and do an encore all three of us together but it never happened
9337545 we were going to do videos for the songs on the best of volume 1 and everything but roth was really trying to take control and we finally just said lets not even do the videos for these songs because hes going to kill the whole thing and so it fell apart but yeah before that tour yeah we tried to make it work we went into the studio and it was kind of funny because we first got together in the studio and we were all in the one room together and we did hot for teacher mean street and a few other songs and its the weirdest thing because once we started playing it was like son of a bitch there it is thats the magic it was like a big d j vu because it was the original band playing again and it sounded pretty fuckin good too
9337546 i used to needle sam a bit and say hey itd be great getting back together
9337547 i have come to actually like the bugger a whole lot and that is simply due to janis unmistakeable talent for writing a fine tune
9337548 i am the prince of darkness i am not making fairy cakes i am making rock cakes
9337549 this is a legal way for consumers to download and share great new content its good for the artist the label and most of all our consumers we are reaching people where they live and on their terms
9337550 coke and island def jam have paved the way for a lot of others who will follow in their paths its a very bold move on the part of both parties and both of them will reap the benefits
9337551 this a legal way for consumers to download and share great new content its good for the artist the label and most of all our consumers we are reaching people where they live and on their terms
9337552 and nothing went horribly during the course of that so here we are
9337553 wir haben nat rlich leichte bedenken aber wir glauben dass unsere argumente sehr gut sind
9337554 weve been out touring for six months weve got four more to go this is great
9337555 i dont need to make records i dont need to tour
9337556 im not chasing anybody anymore im not chasing anything thats what you do in your youth
9337557 its a matter of doing it on a level that youve grown accustomed to while youre also contributing in a relevant way a new way bringing in new generations of fans
9337558 its been 22 years of making records and i must have been to japan 25 times or more theres not too many things in the world i havent seen
9337559 am i going to be doing this when im 88 i dont know
9337560 skynyrd has to close because theyre in the rock and roll hall of fame and were not
9337561 but its 100 a co headline tour every night at the end of the night the two bands will join up for an all star jam
9337562 thank you very much mam you have a great day and thanks for shopping with us
9337563 tottenham memang bermain sangat baik pada pertandingan ini mereka adalah tim yang bermain sepakbola dengan baik
9337564 pertandingan ini tidak mengecewakan kedua tim menampilkan permainan hebat tottenham menumpuk lima pemain di lini tengah
9337565 working with top notch musicians from legendary bands who want to create terrific music is always an enjoyable experience im looking forward to whoever the new lead singer is going to be so the guys can start corrupting their mind
9337566 friends of mine like slash macy gray moby and rob zombie
9337567 throw in their two cents about who should stay and who should go
9337568 something happened that will change my life but i cant tell you until tomorrow
9337569 i was at work at starbucks and i was just gonna go on a lunch break
9337570 hey are you coming to the motely crue show in red deer
9337571 listen i know you dont believe me but im going to have somebody call you that put us in contact with you and let you know its the real thing we wanna do this thing on these guys
9337572 so before the other guy could even call me i think they were just panicked and their road manager called me and says
9337573 bring your pedals and your sticks and whatever you need to bring you can just use tommys kit
9337574 2008 is an unusual year china and air china have met unprecedented challenges
9337575 the airline industry with weakening traffic demand increasing competition and high oil prices faces a long severe winter
9337576 high oil prices and the global economic slowdown will undoubtedly continue to affect the aviation industry for the rest of the year and we might also be impacted beyond 2008
9337577 the overall demand in the aviation sector is slowing down domestic passenger volume can no longer sustain annual growth of 16 percent to 20 percent as it did over the past few years
9337578 while low revenue growth was dragged down by overall traffic slowdown surging jet fuel costs in the first half of 2008 has driven up total operating costs
9337579 eliminate the effects of a stronger yuan and you will find out their core business is bleeding
9337580 we expect a government mandated restructuring at some point over the next 12 months
9337581 i am rather upbeat about the bicycle industrys sales growth in the long run and i believe sales will grow at a faster pace if more and more countries attempt to restrict motor vehicles many big cities in china have even banned or restricted motorcycles
9337582 although prices of aluminum and carbon fiber have been more stable recently compared with three years ago they have increased nearly three fold
9337583 the quality of our landscapes should not be sacrificed to accommodate onshore wind power targets that do not reasonably consider the capacity of rural areas to accommodate them
9337584 the scale of onshore wind anticipated as necessary to meet 2020 targets causes grave concerns with regard to the ability of high quality areas such as cumbria to accommodate them without significant areas being adversely changed in character
9337585 any adverse effects that might arise from these such as significant changes to the character and ecosystem areas are unknown and could limit their real potential
9337586 the government needs to provide appropriate investment to allow relevant local bodies to carry out surveys and feasibility studies to determine the real potential of these areas the social economic and environmental effects and determine the best type of tidal technology
9337587 spoken tributes filmed packages and performances by some of todays hottest rock acts as well as the legends themselves
9337588 well elliot and todd have worked together in the past elliott had played on a record that todd had produced so when his name came up elliot got in touch with todd
9337589 the way todd was invited to be in the band was that we were trying to get this together with ric and david and when it became apparent that they didnt wish to tour and didnt want to be involved in the plans we were making it became obvious to greg and i that we would have to find a new front man we could have found a sound alike and made it sound like the old cars and just played the hits and made a quick buck but what we really wanted to do was have a band with a person in it whos creative who could write songs sing and we could record new albums with and go from strength to strength i was thinking about it and who would be a great person for that and todds name came up and if you think about it hes the perfect guy hes a great singer songwriter hes a front man a producer engineer just a really talented guy we used to play a lot of shows with utopia and i could see similarities in the two bands there were touchstones stylistically that both bands shared so i felt hed be a good fit and i just called todd i proposed it and he said he was very interested
9337590 its perfect i was a todd fan before i ever was in the cars hes got this quality thats in between ric amp ben but he has his own personality
9337591 when we got together in the rehearsal room in la we played a few cars songs and it just sounded great it sounded like the cars but it also sounded like todd hes not impersonating anybody its a great combination and a great fit well do some cars live as well as todd stuff but what im most excited about is the new stuff weve recorded and that we have the ability to move forward as a new band and do new studio albums of new material
9337592 probably not with the first record wed always say hopefully well be in the position to do a second record thats how i feel about the new line up
9337593 it sure feels like a band and thats the thing thats got me excited playing with the band is great
9337594 this is my career this is what i do if it was just a one tour cash in thing i dont think id be interested id like to be doing this for a long long time and the band we have is a band of great players kasim is a wonderful bass player and great singer in fact he sings drive in the show he has that sweet voice that benjamin could do prairie prince from the tubes is just a powerhouse drummer it just feels great with a really rocking rhythm section weve got deeper grooves than we could achieve before i love the old band and im proud of the work we did and im not trying to compare or say this is a better band but this is a really great band thats fun to play with if youre going to come back after so long like the cars are you have to start somewhere and the obvious place to start this tour is our chance to review what weve accomplished as a band thus far and remind people who we are and what weve done and use it as a stepping off point to move forward
9337595 yeah its kind of funny one of the challenges of presenting the new band is how well do they play the cars songs so this will be the answer to that question i guess laughs use this as a starting point
9337596 one of the things we wanted to accomplish by doing this live album was people are going to be wondering about this band so they can buy this record and hear that its us and the new song not tonight sounds like a classic cars single
9337597 im hoping well include more we just havent gotten around to learning them yet its perfectly natural that todd brings in his whole hes got a legion of fans wholl come to see him and wonder whats he doing with these guys its a perfectly natural acknowledgment of not just elliott and is history but his and kasims as well
9337598 its been crazy but its been fun because in practice you go in and go through all the reps and you try to make all the throws and when you step on the game field everything slows down
9337599 the crowd is loud but you block everything out and you just play ball and im going to get the opportunity sunday to just go out and play ball
9337600 bishop is just fitting into the mold that i expected from him
9337601 he has shown the ability and inclination to step in and be a leader
9337602 hes certainly a more mobile quarterback than marcus crandell would have been
9337603 he probably has the strongest arm in the cfl and hes a proven winner and he knows how to win football games
9337604 with bishop in there theyre definitely going to have to stay honest and assign somebody to him
9337605 so yeah it should open up some lanes for me
9337606 we wanted to put it out tour to support it and make it a legitimate record rather than just some throwaway thing
9337607 and we were kind of happy with the way it turned out essentially a covers album is supposed to be about fun its revisiting your youth and showing the world where your true roots are it shouldnt be a labor of love
9337608 to me we were always a lot more pop than heavy metal
9337609 its been extremely hard to get that point across to people so the thing is we could work both ways we could tour with journey or bryan adams and we could tour with the scorpions too

9337612 we would closely watch the situation and take timely measures to keep the tainted products out for the safety of chinese consumers
9337613 yeah we hot box our entire house but could you take of you shoes and leave em at the front
9337614 whilst it was disappointing that the inspector overturned the decision and granted planning consent we were at least encouraged that the inspector imposed certain conditions
9337615 this shows that the inspector recognised the importance and sensitivity of this location for birds and other valuable wildlife objectors are not against the principle of green and sustainable energy but believe strongly that this must be located in the right place chiplow in no way falls into this category
9337616 i guess you could say im a tree hugger im a greenie i would like to do our total island green
9337617 why dont we all get together do the same thing make this island into something really spectacular
9337618 i ask you with all sense of urgency start voting once in a while for the things we castle amp cooke want to do they are all for you one way or another im not making any money on the island i dont think in my lifetime i will ever make any so im not taking anything away from you i am giving far more to everyone in this room than you are giving to me
9337619 theyre not going to let you go hunting in that area or go fishing in that area
9337620 we still do our fishing and hunting the quality of life is good here
9337621 i hate to put a lot of money in the ground until we start to see the resort market turn a little bit
9337622 you only have to look across the water to molokai to see what lack of someone that is in love with your island can do i love everyone on the island i am very much interested in the economic stability of lanai
9337623 its not promising but its not out of the question
9337624 we think hawaii needs to be and will be the role model for the globe for renewable energy lanai is certainly blessed with wind resources and we should be tapping into that
9337625 i think we have the opportunity to have a good balance
9337626 we are the last intact plantation community even though were not a plantation anymore there was a lot of concern in this community that as change occurs it shouldnt erase all that was before
9337627 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9337628 we need a strong and considered european role to return to reason and responsibility
9337629 russias commitment to relations of friendship and cooperation with the rest of europe is in question its up to russia to make a fundamental choice in this respect
9337630 without urgent action we risk sleepwalking into an energy dependence on less stable or reliable partners
9337631 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9337632 to make that place that we spend so much time sleeping and recharging our batteries the best place in the world we look to purchase some of the best bedroom sets that we can in order to create that atmosphere there are many bedroom furniture shops and outlets out there that give us a wide choice when it comes to making the choices now we have many resources popping up all over the internet and that has made choosing bedroom sets a pleasure for those of us who want to make our bedrooms that much more special of a place to be

9337643 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
9337644 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
9337645 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
9337646 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
9337647 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
9337648 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
9337649 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
9337650 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
9337651 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
9337652 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
9337653 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
9337654 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
9337655 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
9337656 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
9337657 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
9337658 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
9337659 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
9337660 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
9337661 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
9337662 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
9337663 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
9337664 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
9337665 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
9337666 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
9337667 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
9337668 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
9337669 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
9337670 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
9337671 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
9337672 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
9337673 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

9337705 i wasnt even going to tell you about this but they have these cameras all over the place and their little cameras took pictures of the back of my car
9337706 the state of illinois took pictures of the back of my car and i did always wonder what the back of my car looked like and it looks cute that little station wagon of mine so that was nice but apparently the cameras are there to catch people not paying i got a not so nice letter and a bill
9337707 that was only for the way up to north dakota i am sure another one is coming for the trip back home i am expecting it any day now
9337708 i believe in picking lane and staying in it i figured i should just stay where i was and i thought ipass meant i could just pass right on through which i was happy about because i did not have the time to merge and stop and wait for people to pay for their tolls i mean it was telling me that i could pass so i was just passing thinking id pay everything at the end
9337709 and did you get a ticket when you first started

9337715 i managed to make up one place and maintain that to the end of my stint we managed to keep it clean throughout the team is really good and did a great job the strategy was perfect and they deserved for us to be in first place
9337716 the team did a very good job in terms of strategy which was especially good after mosport where we struggled
9337717 this time we were a little bit lucky james did his stint with tires from qualifying and the car looked ok although there was a bit of understeer the tires looked fine as well we did put a lot of time on the tires and i dont think they could have could have lasted another 10 laps or half stint it was very close all the time
9337718 of course we would have prefered to have won the title under different circumstances
9337719 but with seven consecutive victories already this season we certainly feel we have earned the title
9337720 for the first time we didnt have any problems and we were the faster car ollie did a good job pushing the car up to the end our crew did a very good job and they have all three years michelin and compuware were great this week they are very strong and know what to do they are experienced and have a winning spirit they never give up
9337721 i havent been so kind to the car the last couple of events and it was great to reward the guys for their hard work this year
9337722 this is the place they want to win more than anywhere else it is a fantastic team and they have themselves in a position that they know the car and the series so well its one of the best sports car teams in the world if not the best
9337723 i said yesterday that my favorite part of the track was the start finish line
9337724 in my second stint i came out behind johannes and i wasnt going to make a stupid move on him unfortunately he had an incident with a prototype and then it became hard to communicate with my pit crew they couldnt hear me and i could barely hear them i unplugged the radio twisted it and suddenly it worked at the end another yellow came and i had to push a little more even after one lap there was a big gap and it was easy at the end
9337725 we are in good shape and still have to fight for race wins you have to have luck to win a championship and everyone is trying their best were keeping our heads down and going forward

9337819 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9337820 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9337821 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9337822 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9337823 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9337824 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9337825 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9337826 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9337827 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9337828 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9337829 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9337830 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9337831 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9337832 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9337833 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9337834 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9337835 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9337836 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9337837 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9337838 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9337839 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9337840 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9337841 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9337842 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9337843 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9337844 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9337845 who are open to doing something on the production side
9337846 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9337847 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9337848 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9337849 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9337850 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9337851 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9337852 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9337853 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9337854 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9337855 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9337856 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9337857 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9337858 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9337859 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9337860 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9337861 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9337862 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9337863 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9337864 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

9337866 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9337867 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9337868 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9337869 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9337870 the screens will also show feeds from security cameras controlled by the state patrol minnesota department of transportation and st paul minneapolis and metro transit police departments before the rnc there was no interface for all the agencies cameras to be seen in one place local officials could continue to use the system after the rnc
9337871 efficient asset confiscation ghettoization deportation enslaved labor and ultimately annihilation
9337872 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9337873 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9337874 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9337875 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9337876 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9337877 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9337878 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9337879 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9337880 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9337881 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9337882 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9337883 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9337884 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9337885 there was a nice big kiss at the end with both hands on the cheeks
9337886 you are helping to destroy the foundation of this country
9337887 we dont agree on everything but i respect her passion
9337888 im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative well shes a better speaker than mccain
9337889 people will say she hasnt been on the national scene long enough but i believe shes a quick study
9337890 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
9337891 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
9337892 id rather be lost and happy than to know where i am and not like it
9337893 from late 2003 through most of 2004 attempts to extend and expand the ptc were held hostage to the fossil fuel dominated comprehensive energy bill that ultimately failed to pass during the 108th congress

9337908 i always wonder who gave you that necklace it seems like its a treasure to you
9337909 you know how i liked to go to the park and play soccer back then i met her there when i was thirteen and she was twelve we started to become friends because we both like to play soccer soon we were close friends but i dont really know much about her background and vice versa one day we wanted to buy souvenirs so we bought two necklaces one necklace has a key face and the other has a lock face and we asked the seller to engrave forever on the lock face and together on the key i chose a lock face because it looks manly
9337910 because after my sisters death i was too shocked so i shut everything out of my mind i only wanted to focus on finding out who was the culprit after that incident i stopped seeing her and moved to tokyo to study in order to become a detective
9337911 and you met me would you be back with her if you see her again
9337912 who knows she might be in love with someone else already if we are destined to be together fate will let us meet again
9337913 anyway back to work lousy girl i should charge you money for asking too many questions

9337935 a single piece of land is cultivated by an average of six people when the state is self sufficient in food production wheres the harm in promoting industries simultaneously at least that will open up huge employment avenues for all
9337936 when banerjee has failed to understand that ancillary industries and the mother plant must be together or else nano cannot roll out from singur its no point in showing any logic to her banerjee says the government has illegally acquired land at singur but it is she who has put up a dais on the national highway 2 nh2 which is illegal and clogged the entire road
9337937 its the moral duty of the government to look for the welfare of the poor we have already trained 1 500 people including women at singur for the tata motors plant
9337938 i am always ready to discuss the matter with banerjee and arrive at a solution provided she stops being irrational and logically perceives the matter
9337939 we have suspended the agitation for the time being and not called it off as some of our demands are yet to be met the exclusive use of the land has been given to the shrine board without charging any money this has been agreed upon

9337950 and with evangelical prayers failing to bring rain down on obamas stadium speech we thought we might be stuck with bush and cheney thats when someone thought to call rove next thing we new gustav was on the line

9337952 we continue to show steady growth despite the slowdown in the global economy thus far in 2008 our fuel subsidiaries both in israel and europe performed well as a result of the successful fuel retail strategy we have put in place focusing on convenience stores and capitalizing on economies of scale in addition our automotive holdings continued to perform well with strong growth in sales however the ongoing refining margin erosion in the us as well as the weaker financial and real estate sectors offset this strong growth in addition the high inflation rate in israel negatively impacted our bottom line by increasing our financial expenses
9337953 despite these challenges our cash position remains very strong standing at nis 1 3 billion we continue to see substantial opportunities for the group particularly in the areas of energy and infrastructure and in this regard we recently raised an additional nis 420 million with our ability to leverage our broad experience and global presence supported by our strong and yet diversified asset base we believe we are well positioned to build and create long term shareholder value our strong commitment to this goal is also very much demonstrated by the recent share buy back program we commenced having purchased 112 000 shares for nis 48 million since july 2008

9338005 there is good reason for israel to make a precipitate strike at iranian nuclear capacity
9338006 the plain fact is that nuclear bombs in the hands of a regime which openly declares its desire to destroy israel are not something israel will peacefully tolerate they will act to stop it while it can still be stopped without the risk of a nuclear strike against israel unless work on an iranian nuclear bomb has definitively ended israel will bomb iran with or without the agreement of the usa and nato
9338007 thanks to peoples wishes and gods will the trend for the existence of the zionist regime is going downwards and this is what god has promised and what all nations want just as the soviet union was wiped out and today does not exist so will the zionist regime soon be wiped out
9338008 bomb iran with or without the agreement of the usa and nato
9338009 the inalienable right of every state to have nuclear weapons and here a state whose clerical fascist rulers might see a nuclear armageddon involving a retaliatory israeli nuclear strike against iran in the way a god crazed suicide bomber sees blowing himself to pieces
9338010 should we condemn an israeli attack because israel has nuclear weapons and therefore the arab and islamic states should have them too
9338011 should we condemn an israeli attack because we are unconditional pacifists we think military action is never justified and therefore israel has no right to attack iran not even to stop it acquiring the nuclear means to mount the ultimate suicide bomb attack on israel
9338012 should we condemn an israeli attack because we would prefer to live in a world where such choices would not be posed where relations between states and peoples are governed by reason and strictly peaceful means
9338013 should we condemn an israeli attack because for choice we would live in a world where the workers of israel iran iraq were united in opposition to all their rulers and strong enough to get rid of them and bring to the region an era of socialist and democratic peace and understanding
9338014 should we condemn an israeli attack because israel would in attacking iran be only an american imperialist tool against a mere regional power and that cancels out the genuine self defence element in pre emptive israeli military action against iranian nuclear weapons
9338015 should we condemn an israeli attack because israel has no right to exist anyway and therefore no right to defend itself
9338016 should we condemn an israeli attack because the iranian government islamic clerical fascist though it is is an anti imperialist power and must be unconditionally supported against the us nato israel
9338017 attack would strengthen the iranian regime and license a smash down on its critics including working class critics inside iran
9338018 should we condemn an israeli attack because israel refuses to dismantle the jewish national state peacefully and agree to an arab palestinian state in which jews would have religious but not israeli national rights and therefore socialists anti racists and anti imperialists must be on the side of those who would conquer and destroy it even in this case with nuclear weapons
9338019 arab palestinian state in which jews would have religious but not israeli national rights
9338020 arab palestinian state in which jews would have religious but not israeli national rights
9338021 should we condemn an israeli attack because we dont deal in vulgar practical choices but in pure historical essences such as anti imperialism
9338022 jerusalem and washington are talking seriously about a possible israeli strike for which american collusion would be indispensable
9338023 even if obama does not yet sit in the white house no jerusalem government could lightly defy americas likely next president on an issue of such gravity

9338030 in 2004 speakers talked about our freedom s more than three times as much as in 2008
9338031 like all americans our prayers are with those who will be affected by hurricane gustav we continue to closely monitor the movement of the storm and are considering necessary contingencies we are in communication with the gulf state governors to make sure the convention is taking all the appropriate steps as the hurricane progresses the safety of our affected delegations is our first priority and preparing for gustav comes before anything else
9338032 the department has apparently completed its operation against outlets selling substandard food in all the major parts of the city but the sale of substandard food still continues
9338033 you can see people cooking and heating food items on main roads which has been prohibited by the department because it is an unhygienic way to treat food moreover it is necessary for the chefs to wear hats and gloves and be very careful about their own hygiene

9338080 i was calm coming into the game but as soon as i got into the game and everyone was cheering i was thinking oh man
9338081 im sure hell even do greater things coming up in the next couple of years
9338082 but going out there he was very relaxed poised and confident he made some great plays and ran the ball really well
9338083 thats our goal whenever we can get a shutout we want to get it
9338084 were happy that we got it today hopefully we can try to build off that
9338085 all those guys can start at any point in time and i think it showed today
9338086 yes its more of a paper move i needed another player up here i played a man short yesterday
9338087 he can play pretty much anywhere hes real new i dont know much about him yet
9338088 he hasnt had a day off in i dont know how long
9338089 we got a chance to put our names on the map
9338090 its a sign of a pretty good football team when you can not play your best and come away with a win particularly in a venue like this
9338091 non bcs teams should get a shot at a championship every year
9338092 we never were able to get the defense a rest because we couldnt move the ball effectively
9338093 we were in a position when it was 17 0 and everybodys saying oh thats just what we do i dont know if there was the urgency in the second quarter but they restored the roar in the third

9338099 brian robiskie and hartline have been telling me to get the ball out there and let us go run under it and ive been working on that all summer and preseason

9338105 i think our players have taken that progression of hoping they can win to thinking they can win to knowing they can win and i think our organization feels that way going into the season
9338106 we have a good group of players and coaches and i think that we will win
9338107 when we lost a few players and had that spell of five to ten minutes where we lost our minds
9338108 from that point on i think the focus of our preseason changed in terms of we are just going to try to get through this and try to get our young players a good experience and lets shoot for labor day to get as many players as we can back
9338109 close to having our full compliment of players for dallas 50 or so
9338110 i think the silver lining to d a being down and out here the last couple weeks is that brady has gotten a chance to start and get some improved quality playing time with the starting offensive line

9338124 and it gives our teammates a lot of confidence in us
9338125 i could have played on it but it kind of shocked me it did the same thing when i originally hurt it so it was more like being shocked but its fine ill continue to get treatment and try to get it better
9338126 i went through the same thing so i told him to relax and breathe and everything is going to be all right
9338127 i was really scared i was crushed to see the disappointment in his face
9338128 i know i need to be more patient but i can work on that

9338268 ich bin einfach bergl cklich mein gr ter traum ist wahr geworden jetzt wird gefeiert
9338269 der zweikampf mit rambow war absolut fair als ich wieder an ihm vorbei war habe ich mich voll konzentriert den sieg sicher nach hause zu fahren
9338270 nach einer ber hrung zu beginn war die spur meines renn polo stark verstellt als ich zweiter war musste ich auf nummer sicher gehen
9338271 ein gro artiges rennen ich kann es selbst kaum glauben
9338272 wenn ich im zeittraining vierter oder f nfter bin spiele ich nachts drei vier m gliche start szenarien durch dieses mal waren es ungef hr 300 ich habe kaum ein auge zugemacht
9338273 ich bin in der letzten kurve einfach zu weit rausgekommen
9338274 ich bin so entt uscht auch f r das team es h tte ein so tolles ergebnis werden k nnen von startplatz vier aus
9338275 mein rechter arm tut ein bisschen weh aber morgen ist das wieder vorbei
9338276 wir hatten in br nn vorne rechts mit dem reifen ein problem heute wollten wir etwas cleveres probieren weil die reifen zwei drei runden brauchen bis sie ordentlich angefahren sind das haben wir vorher gemacht wie schon einige male zuvor doch das hat nicht wirklich geholfen
9338277 generell lief es aber ganz gut dann ist mir in einer kurve die ich gleich fuhr wie vorher einfach die maschine weggeklappt
9338278 in br nn habe ich vielleicht zu viel gepusht aber hier nicht
9338279 wenn ich heute h tte k mpfen m ssen dann w re es schwer geworden meine bremse war nicht so gut und ich konnte nicht gut attackieren
9338280 ich bin reifer ich nehme weniger risiken als im vorjahr manchmal hat man einfach kein gl ck so ist der rennsport eben
9338281 ich habe alles versucht um unsere missliche lage zu verbessern und so viele gegner wie m glich zu berholen
9338282 mein ziel war der f nfte platz aber da hat der vorderreifen nicht mitgemacht
9338283 ich musste am limit durch die kurven fahren um mit den anderen mithalten zu k nnen
9338284 es war ein schwieriger tag und eindeutig nicht das ergebnis das wir nach br nn erwartet hatten
9338285 es ist immer hart sich von einer verletzung zu erholen
9338286 aber er muss das hinter sich lassen die rmel hochkrempeln und die ergebnisse einfahren von denen wir wissen dass er dazu in der lage ist

9338347 lived a village life herding goats and submitting to the rituals of a village witch doctor in the west he had rejected the muslim faith of his youth just as he rejected the babblings of all witch doctors
9338348 each day he would cross himself pray the hail mary the our father and whatever else the attending nuns required
9338349 lived in a largely muslim country he prayed at the feet of a catholic jesus he attended a mosque with his stepfather and learned islam in his public school at home his mother taught him her atheistic optimism
9338350 was to live in a muslim country but be taught by his stepfathers example to ignore the most fundamental teachings of islam he was to attend a roman catholic school but regard christianity as no more than superstition and he was to love a mother who viewed all religion as nothing more than a man made tool for contending with the mysteries of life
9338351 and i would shrug and play the question off unable to confess that i could no longer distinguish between faith and mere folly between faith and simple endurance that while i believed in the sincerelity i heard in their voices i remained a reluctant skeptc doubtful of my own motives wary of expedient conversion having too many quarrels with god to accept a salvation too easily won
9338352 it was a decision to enter a faith by joining a people of faith to come home to a community and so come home to god
9338353 obama had found the answer for his souls need and only a cynical heart would refuse the possibility of a lonely black man in his twenties finding faith through the preaching of gods word
9338354 for obama faith is not simply political garb something a focus group told him he ought to try instead religion to him is transforming lifelong and real it is who he is at the core what he has raised his daughters to live and the well he will draw from as he leads while americans are used to religious insincerity from their political leaders obama seems to be sincere in what he proclaims he embraced religion long before he embraced politics indeed it was his faith that gave him the will to serve in public office and the worldview of that faith that shaped his understanding of what he would do once he came to power

9338365 a criminal enterprise made up of 35 self described anarchists intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9338366 these acts include tactics to blockade and disable delegate buses breaching venue security and injuring police officers

9338371 this is a charge that police use for preventive detention
9338372 it requires that no actual criminal act be committed and borders on criminalizing political advocacy
9338373 the police may claim that the raid was executed according to protocol however the violence inherent in this action may only be a hint of the violence to be expected on monday and beyond and is only a hint at the violence perpetrated daily by the police
9338374 by looking for items found in any twin cities house like jars paint and rags this attempt to portray us as criminals and destroy our credibility has already backfired as evidenced by the masses who have come to support us

9338432 torner talmente presto che non avrai il tempo di sentire la mia mancanza prenditi cura del mio cuore te lho lasciato
9338433 una cosa mi era chiara e la sentivo in fondo allo stomaco al centro delle ossa dalla punta dei capelli alla pianta dei piedi e nel mio petto vuoto chi ama ha il potere di distruggere e io ero stata distrutta sbriciolata
9338434 il tempo passa anche quando sembra impossibile anche quando il rintocco di ogni secondo fa male come il sangue che pulsa nelle ferite passa in maniera disuguale tra strani scarti e bonacce prolungate ma passa persino per me
9338435 essere amati tanto profondamente ci protegge per sempre anche quando la persona che ci ha amato non c pi
9338436 prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit mi vuoi sposare
9338437 e dward theres something that i want to do before im not human anymore

9338442 non strano come un libro diventi pi spesso se viene letto e riletto di continuo come se ogni volta fra le pagine rimanesse attaccato qualcosa sensazioni pensieri rumori odori e quando a distanza di anni li riapri ritrovi te stesso un p pi giovane un po diverso quasi il libro ti avesse conservato come un fiore fatto seccare fra le pagine un po estraneo e un po familiare

9338444 but it helps them become good citizens that was the way i was taught when i was a child its not abuse i love my grandchildren how could i abuse them
9338445 but the statistics are just the tip of the iceberg
9338446 if an adult hits a child no one reports this to the relevant authorities
9338447 that would only happen if a child was badly injured then the police would come in but they would just handle the case by charging the parent with creating disorder or making loud sounds rather than child abuse
9338448 if you slap a child that violates the law but no one reports that
9338449 these are seen as normal acts according to the law one has to have 11 percent of the body injured to make it a criminal case
9338450 many people have no idea that boys can be sexually abused
9338451 they dont imagine what kind of abuse that could be so they never think that boys need to be protected
9338452 i only hit my son to teach him to become a good man of course there are limitations you cannot beat a kid too hard
9338453 when you make a blockade or a siege on a non democratic regime many times it is counterproductive
9338454 the cybermission is important and it will go forward for the air force
9338455 the issue is in what context form and national framework this is not just about the air force it has to fit with the strategic command and the broader national security community and were going to make sure all those pieces fit together as we proceed
9338456 the military is thinking more about the non kinetic effects of warfare
9338457 it makes sense to have the guys delivering most of the precision ordnance from the air to have control over both the kinetic and the non kinetic aspects of the operation
9338458 traditionally the air force has carried out strategic bombing strategic cyberwarfare could be seen as an extension of that mission
9338459 fifty years later they are still squabbling over which is the lead service in space
9338460 the national security agency may have tapped into a foreign command and control system while the air force simultaneously has plans to take it out
9338461 i would love to say there should be an information warfare czar to coordinate these types of activities but we often find there is not good coordination even at the higher levels
9338462 to sit the responsible managers down together to coordinate activities jointly
9338463 if you ask arsene wenger he wants kalou as a centre forward and arsene is an intelligent man
9338464 he wanted kalou two or three months ago when we started negotiations for some players i said no
9338465 if he loves kalou as a number nine i will try it sometimes but i have anelka drogba and franco di santo

9338479 tidaklah seorang hamba yang puasa di jalan allah kecuali akan allah jauhkan dia karena puasanya dari neraka sejauh tujuh puluh musim
9338480 puasa adalah perisai seorang hamba berperisai dengannya dari api neraka
9338481 barangsiapa yang berpuasa sehari di jalan allah maka di antara dia dan neraka ada parit yang luasnya seperti antara langit dengan bumi
9338482 semua amalan bani adam untuknya kecuali puasa baginya pahala yang terbatas kecuali puasa karena pahalanya tidak terbatas karena puasa itu untuk ku dan aku akan membalasnya puasa adalah perisai jika salah seorang dari kalian sedang berpuasa janganlah berkata keji dan berteriak teriak jika ada orang yang mencercanya atau memeranginya maka ucapkanlah aku sedang berpuasa demi dzat yang jiwa muhammad di tangan nya sesunguhnya bau mulut orang yang berpuasa lebih wangi di sisi allah daripada bau misk orang yang puasa mempunyai dua kegembiraan jika berbuka mereka gembira jika bertemu rabbnya mereka gembira karena puasa yang dilakukannya
9338483 puasa dan akan memberikan syafaat kepada hamba di hari kiamat puasa akan berkata
9338484 aku telah menghalanginya dari tidur di malam hari maka berilah dia syafaat karenaku
9338485 naturally there will be periods of distress and difficulty and even severe test but if that person turns firmly towards the divine manifestation studies carefully his spiritual teachings and receives the blessings of the holy spirit he will find that in reality these tests and difficulties have been the gifts of god to enable him to grow and develop
9338486 know moreover that it is through such words that god proveth his servants and sifteth them separating the believer from the infidel the detached from the worldly the pious from the profligate the doer of good from the worker of iniquity and so forth
9338487 if people are fundamentally spiritual beings why do we begin our lives in the physical world
9338488 and yet how often we seem to forget the clear and repeated warnings of our beloved master who in particular during the concluding years of his mission on earth laid stress on the severe mental tests that would inevitably sweep over his loved ones of the west tests that would purge purify and prepare them for their noble mission in life
9338489 and as to the worlds evil plight we need but recall the writings and sayings of bah ull h who more than fifty years ago declared in terms prophetic the prime cause of the ills and sufferings of mankind and set forth their true and divine remedy
9338490 ours is then the duty and privilege to labor by day and by night amidst the storm and stress of these troublous days that we may quicken the zeal of our fellow men rekindle their hopes stimulate their interest open their eyes to the true faith of god and enlist their active support in the carrying out of our common task for the peace and regeneration of the world
9338491 alfonso gagliano receiving a loan from farm credit canada was disturbing the conservative government believes that money should go to help farmers not former liberal cabinet ministers

9338493 in the coming months it will be tempting for some in congress to try to score political points instead of getting work done for the american people our citizens deserve better
9338494 we still have time to accomplish important goals for our country my administration remains hopeful that we can work with democratic leaders in congress on bipartisan measures to help americans cope with this period of economic uncertainty
9338495 do not expect this speech to define the presidents legacy
9338496 this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments of the past seven and a half years it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9338497 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities for the republican convention because these days they are awfully hard to tell apart

9338601 we continue to show steady growth despite the slowdown in the global economy thus far in 2008 our fuel subsidiaries both in israel and europe performed well as a result of the successful fuel retail strategy we have put in place focusing on convenience stores and capitalizing on economies of scale in addition our automotive holdings continued to perform well with strong growth in sales however the ongoing refining margin erosion in the us as well as the weaker financial and real estate sectors offset this strong growth in addition the high inflation rate in israel negatively impacted our bottom line by increasing our financial expenses
9338602 despite these challenges our cash position remains very strong standing at nis 1 3 billion we continue to see substantial opportunities for the group particularly in the areas of energy and infrastructure and in this regard we recently raised an additional nis 420 million with our ability to leverage our broad experience and global presence supported by our strong and yet diversified asset base we believe we are well positioned to build and create long term shareholder value our strong commitment to this goal is also very much demonstrated by the recent share buy back program we commenced having purchased 112 000 shares for nis 48 million since july 2008

9338739 todays marketplace is completely flooded with an array of products segments and categories brand extensions and more
9338740 this makes selecting the right product a very complex exercise and manufacturers need to ask how to stand out how to make sure that their product gets chosen above any other
9338741 you have only a couple of seconds to pull a prospective customer in and if your packaging design is not cutting edge your product will be missed and will eventually move lower and lower on the shelf until it is gone
9338742 at liquidlab we follow a strategic design process and align our clients packaging design with their business and marketing plans always making sure we stay true to the brand resulting in packaging that works harder and sells easier
9338743 designing packaging that is consumer centric will turn into sales so we carried elements from sea harvests previous packaging over onto the new range as we did not want to create confusion with the consumer at the same time there was a lot of cleaning up to be done and we felt that we had to create a more consistent look across the entire range
9338744 liquidlab believes that by following the natural reading order of the human brain it is possible to create designs that catch the eye heart and mind we used a holding shape that is very similar to the previous packaging but allows more space for beautiful natural and relevant photography something we believe helps sell a product typography also played a huge role as the previous typography was very inconsistent by using the same style on all the sea harvest packs the range is really pulled together creating a very strong impact on the shelf
9338745 we used cues in the photography to emphasise flavour as well as different colour lozenges this is a very important part of packaging design as ending up with the wrong flavour can be very infuriating for any consumer
9338746 colour management was handled by liquidlabs state of the art dtp department to provide the customer with consistent colour throughout the range and process
9338747 the results are amazing and we are very happy with the printers one particular printer could not believe how easy it was to match to our iso standard calibrated proofs having longstanding relationships with most packaging manufacturers and printers makes it easier for us to get brilliant results as we know what the limitations are and we also know what can be achieved there are so many different substrates and ways of printing the list is endless and technology also changes all the time so keeping abreast of these issues adds huge value to our business
9338748 sea harvest have over 30 products ranging over six different segments and so it was no easy task to come up with a new design matrix that is consistent and has a high level of impact
9338749 through the changes to our packaging alone sea harvest have achieved some wonderful results indicating the importance of effective packaging of ones brand
9338750 working with liquidlab has been a brilliant experience their knowledge talent and professionalism has succeeded in ensuring an excellent market response in sea harvest products

9338773 i saw something large and black dart out in front of my car about 50 metres in the distance
9338774 at first i thought it was a deer but as i got closer to the place it had disappeared i saw something moving in the undergrowth
9338775 it was smaller than a deer but it had a large black tail and was sort of slinking through the bracken
9338776 there was no way it was an average cat it was much too large
9338777 as i was driving back to the town from rugeley i definitely saw something moving from the fields into the woods
9338778 i was a fair distance away as i came over the brow of the hill but this thing was not a deer it moved in a slow and unhurried way it was very low to the ground

9338842 in the bible the offer of pardon on the part of god is conditioned upon intention to reform on the part of man there can be no spiritual regeneration till there has been a moral reformation
9338843 but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that his faith is counted for righteousness
9338844 we believe that continuance in a state of salvation depends upon continued obedient faith in christ
9338845 we are dead in our trespasses and sins ephesians 2 1 and until we forsake them through repentance we cannot be made alive in christ
9338846 if belief is all that is necessary for salvation then the logical conclusion is that one need never repent
9338847 but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth his faith is counted for righteousness
9338848 i hope this isnt a bad thought because i may have to repent or ill go to hell
9338849 eternal security is a great spiritual truth but it should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved always saved with no regard for what you believe or do the writer of hebrews 12 14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the lords presence
9338850 pastor roloff is correctly teaching that genuine repentance brings forth a changed life but he is not requiring a changed life to get saved
9338851 true repentance is sorrow for sin committed against a holy god and not only sorrow for sin but
9338852 again he is speaking about the evidences of those who have already repented he is not teaching lordship salvation
9338853 this is exactly what brother hutson and pastor hyles taught
9338854 but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name
9338855 repentance is inseparable from faith the greek word for repentance in the bible simply means a change of mind that is a wholesome change of attitude toward sin and toward god one who turns his heart to trust in christ has naturally turned his heart away from the love of sin
9338856 any sinner who sincerely wants to be saved may be saved if hell simply come by way of the precious blood of jesus
9338857 repentance is inseparable from faith the greek word for repentance in the bible simply means a change of mind that is a wholesale change of attitude toward sin and toward god one who turns his heart to trust in christ has naturally turned his heart away from the love of sin it is a mistake to make a process out of salvation with repentance and faith as separate steps they are really different parts of the same step or different ways of speaking of the same attitude of heart one who repents that is has turned from rebellion and unbelief to trust christ has believed of course one who trusts in christ has necessarily turned his heart from rebellion and rejection of christ and so has repented
9338858 the greek word for repentance in the bible simply means a change of mind that is
9338859 spurgeon is talking about the fruit of genuine repentance not works salvation
9338860 again he is talking about the fruit of genuine repentance not forsaking ones sins to get saved
9338861 you cannot have salvation without repentance and the evidence of salvation is a changed life 2nd corinthians 5 17 2nd peter 3 9
9338862 there is none greater in this house than i neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee because thou art his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god

9338866 the severity of the law should be unsparingly applied to the conscience until the sinners self righteousness is annihilated and he stands speechless and condemned before the holy god
9338867 now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before god
9338868 but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly that continuance in a state of salvation depends upon continued obedient faith in christ
9338869 real repentance is putting your trust in jesus christ so you will not live like that anymore
9338870 you can use the car if youre willing to gas it
9338871 the implication is clear i expect him to fill the gas tank before he returns the car
9338872 salvation is the gift of god and includes the forgiveness of sins the imputation of the righteousness of jesus christ and the gift of eternal life union with the triune god provides all blessings in this life and the life hereafter salvation is received by faith alone apart from all good works and merit
9338873 real repentance is putting your trust in jesus christ so you will not live like that anymore
9338874 coming to christ does not give us a license to sin it gives us even more of a hatred for sin and causes us to desire to live a life of righteousness so that we can be pleasing to our god and show our gratitude and our love to our saviour jesus set me free from sin not to sin
9338875 then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders

9338877 do you have his righteousness we have no righteousness of our own isaiah 64 6 to get to heaven we need gods righteousness which is found only in christ jesus romans 10 3 4
9338878 repentance is a complete change of heart and mind and it also includes turning away from sin
9338879 what is gods purpose for sending his son into this world why did christ have to come and die for you and me on the cross it is simply because we have sinned sin seperate us from god romans3 23
9338880 and do you think god will accept sin into his kingdom absolutely no
9338881 but we must persevere to the end like paul says in his letter to the philiphians

9338883 speak where the scriptures speak and remain silent where the scriptures are silent
9338884 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
9338885 and it came to pass when he was in a certain city behold a man full of leprosy who seeing jesus fell on his face and besought him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean and he put forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou clean and immediately the leprosy departed from him and he charged him to tell no man but go and shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as moses commanded for a testimony unto them

9338889 sirs what must i do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house
9338890 if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his
9338891 christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect
9338892 to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins
9338893 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
9338894 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
9338895 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
9338896 in spite of this obvious truth the cultists remain steadfast in their heresy insisting that acts 2 38 sets forth water baptism as a requirement for salvation thus this verse of scripture has become satans favorite bible verse
9338897 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
9338898 his words preceding verse 38 were so convicting that his listeners were
9338899 repent and be baptized because your sins have been given
9338900 since this involves jews it involves a nation verse 36
9338901 in acts 8 an individual from africa is saved before baptism in acts 9 an individual from asia is saved before baptism in acts 10 an individual from europe is saved before baptism
9338902 in acts 2 38 the holy ghost was promised to be given to the converts after they were baptized yet in acts 10 44 the holy ghost falls upon the gentiles before they are baptized
9338903 if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his
9338904 where did they jews in acts 2 call on the name of the lord where does it say they called on the name of the lord
9338905 anyone who has the smallest bit of bible greek learning knows that greek prepositions do not carry a fixed meaning their meanings fluctuate from one verse to another
9338906 where in those chapters does it say they were saved before they were baptized
9338907 when was paul saved before his sins were forgiven was he saved after his sins were forgiven
9338908 remember according to mr melton the jews have a different command than the gentiles
9338909 why was the holy spirit poured out upon the gentiles why why did peter command the gentiles to be baptized in water why did peter baptize the gentiles in the name of jesus just as he baptized the jews in the name of jesus
9338910 can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we
9338911 romans 8 9 is not miraculous acts 10 is miraculous
9338912 water baptism follows salvation as one of the first steps of obedience for the new believer
9338913 where did they jews in acts 2 call on the name of the lord where does it say they called on the name of the lord
9338914 in fact he even told his listeners how to be saved before verse 38
9338915 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
9338916 anyone who has the smallest bit of bible greek learning knows that greek prepositions do not carry a fixed meaning their meanings fluctuate from one verse to another
9338917 speaking of context the surest way to know the meaning of a word is based on the context in which it is used
9338918 repent and be baptized because your sins have been given
9338919 in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit
9338920 where in those chapters does it say they were saved before they were baptized
9338921 when was paul saved before his sins were forgiven was he saved after his sins were forgiven
9338922 paul is saved the moment he says to the lord who art thou lord
9338923 go into the city and will be told thee what thou must do
9338924 remember according to mr melton the jews have a different command than the gentiles
9338925 why was the holy spirit poured out upon the gentiles why why did peter command the gentiles to be baptized in water why did peter baptize the gentiles in the name of jesus just as he baptized the jews in the name of jesus
9338926 can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we
9338927 romans 8 9 is not miraculous acts 10 is miraculous
9338928 you said because it is used by many false prophets
9338929 mr melton and you do not like the verse but i do it is part of gods word
9338930 mr melton said peter told the jews how to be saved before verse 38 so my question is where does it say the jews called on the name of the lord you know people were saved in acts 2 if they were told how to be saved and they were saved where does it say they called on the name of the lord
9338931 i wonder how the eunuch knew about baptism could it be that when you preach jesus you preach remission of sins and when you preach remission of sins you preach baptism for the remission of sins why did the eunuch go on his way rejoicing after he was baptized
9338932 see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized
9338933 i believe that jesus christ is the son of god
9338934 they went down both into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him and he went on his way rejoicing
9338935 when were the jews saved in acts 2 before or after they asked what they must do
9338936 those samaritans regard the word of god as truth but they do not understand the plan of salvation from god
9338937 how does mr melton know that acts 2 38 is satans favorite verse
9338938 and said o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord
9338939 a person is saved when they call on the name of the lord you say they are not
9338940 acts 2 38 thats a command repent and be baptized for the remission of sins
9338941 acts 8 doesnt say that philip taught baptism but we know he did
9338942 my question is did they receive the word at that time when were they baptized with the holy spirit
9338943 are you willing to stand behind your assumption that every time the word
9338944 why did paul baptize the twelve in acts 9 in the name of jesus according to your teaching he should have baptized them in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit
9338945 now heres paul in acts 19 correcting some jews guess what paul baptizes them in the name of jesus
9338946 you say the samaritans were baptized in the name of jesus but they didnt understand
9338947 seventhly about the holy spirit and baptism model here is the explanation
9338948 baptism is the same way the lord paid the price for sin he commands however that we baptized those who believe and are baptized will be saved
9338949 for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
9338950 but peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money
9338951 thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of god
9338952 when was paul saved before or after his sins were washed away
9338953 i think i read that you only use the kjv if that is true why
9338954 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
9338955 arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
9338956 repent and be baptized in the name of jesus for the remission of sins
9338957 why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
9338958 go into the city and it will told you what you must do
9338959 he that believes and is baptized shall be saved but he that believes not shall be damned
9338960 you see your ignorance is way faster than your logic
9338961 are you the same person who has been responding to all my comments you see your ignorance is way faster than your logic
9338962 you see your ignorance is way faster than your logic
9338963 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
9338964 and all the city was moved and the people ran together and they took paul and drew him out of the temple and forthwith the doors were shut
9338965 saul saul why persecutest thou me i am jesus of nazareth whom thou persecutest and i paul said what shall i do lord
9338966 came unto me and stood and said unto me brother saul receive thy sight and the same hour i looked up upon him
9338967 baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
9338968 being justified declared absolutely righteous freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation payment through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god
9338969 and saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord
9338970 i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee christ and when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shed i also was standing by and consenting unto his death and kept the raiment of them that slew him
9338971 mr melton says it is satans favorite verse because he knows acts 2 38 is a powerful verse he knows it contradicts what he believes and teaches he doesnt like acts 2 38 it is too plain and simple
9338972 he cannot win me over to his opinion because no matter what he says acts 2 38 remains a command
9338973 regarding baptism it is a way for new believers to show their obedience to the lord and a public testimony they need to make
9338974 the subject matter in question of which verse 16 is a part begins back in acts 21 15 where paul goes to jerusalem it is here in the temple that the people apprehended paul
9338975 and all the city was moved and the people ran together and they took paul and drew him out of the temple and forthwith the doors were shut
9338976 the sins paul was going to wash away were his acts of persecution against christians prior to being saved
9338977 where does it say that in the bible that is not what the bible says
9338978 paul did not confess jesus in acts 9 he asked a question he didnt know it was jesus he was not saved then if he was saved he would not need to be baptized washing away his sins that is so plain and clear and simple
9338979 regarding baptism it is a way for new believers to show their obedience to the lord and a public testimony they need to make
9338980 by the way we are brothers and sisters in christ not brethren in christ
9338981 there came then his brethren and his mother and standing without sent unto him calling him
9338982 and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day
9338983 spiritual brother has nothing to do with the word brethren at all
9338984 paul is saved the moment he says to the lord in acts 9 5
9338985 spiritual brother and sister in christ has nothing to do with the word
9338986 hey you two are not brother and sister in christ at all because many jews call each other brethren in bible
9338987 brethren america is going downward lets do something together to push her back
9338988 well jews call each other brethren usually so this stranger does not mean anything when he calls me brother
9338989 paul wasnt saved when he asked the question how do i know that because he didnt have the spirit read acts 9 17
9338990 that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost
9338991 and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness
9338992 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
9338993 and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god
9338994 but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests
9338995 for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
9338996 then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost
9338997 he didnt know that it was jesus so how can he receive jesus when he doesnt know it is jesus
9338998 and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks
9338999 and he trembling and astonished said lord what wilt thou have me to do
9339000 when was paul saved before his sins were washed away or after
9339001 paul is saved the moment he says to the lord in acts 9 5
9339002 well i think i already answer this question but i will restate it anyway
9339003 repent and be baptized for the remission of your sins
9339004 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
9339005 if you continue on acts 9 you will come to acts 9 17 where ananias calls paul
9339006 arise and be baptized washing away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
9339007 the dead spirit of sinners will be baptized with the holy spirit so that sinners can now have eternal life you see the holy spirit will not come to a person as long as that person does not accept the salvation plan from god i e accepting jesus christ as his personal saviour
9339008 dead spirit of sinners will be baptized with the holy spirit
9339009 in acts 2 4 all apostles of christ are filled with the holy spirit and they immediately do miracle
9339010 or was he healed when he thought other waters were better than jordan or was he healed while he walked to the jordan to be healed or was healed when he dipped 3 times or was healed he healed when dipped 6 times or was he healed when he dipped 7 times
9339011 i encourage you to read that article here is the link
9339012 the problem with your answers are they deny what ananias said
9339013 no matter how much you twist this passage it is still there
9339014 i then pointed out john baptized many people that is the old testament
9339015 where does it say that paul and ananias do not have any biological relationship where does it say that
9339016 where is the proof that acts 2 38 is satans favorite verse
9339017 as far as the blood of jesus christ taking away the sin of the world i do not deny that
9339018 who caused the walls to tumble down the lord or the trumpets
9339019 who healed him was it the water or the lord
9339020 only the saved are spiritual brothers and sisters in christ and such was saul
9339021 baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
9339022 being justified declared absolutely righteous freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation payment through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god
9339023 why tarriest thou arise and be baptized washing away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
9339024 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus for the remissions of your sins
9339025 if pauls sins were washed away after he was baptized then do you think that jesus blood on the cross is not enough to wash away pauls sins
9339026 repent and be baptized in the name of jesus for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit
9339027 arise and be baptized washing away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
9339028 suppose there is another sick man that see how naaman is healed by dipping into water and he also jumps into that same water he will not be healed
9339029 paul and ananias were fellow kinsmens prior to pauls conversion evidenced by the following they were both jews
9339030 i indeed have baptized you with water but he jesus shall baptize you with the holy ghost
9339031 yet your site is full of anger and fault finding toward others
9339032 fundamental christianity satans favorite website if thats complimentary then put it on your website call your website or your blog satans favorite go ahead its not a bad thing just use it no harm meant
9339033 your statement cannot be answered do you know why it is open ended
9339034 no magic powers in water or trumpets its all about trusting the word of the lord its all about trusting the lord
9339035 men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this day
9339036 by the way do you know what john the baptist says
9339037 i indeed have baptized you with water but he jesus shall baptize you with the holy ghost
9339038 what i mean in that statement is the water will have absolutely no power without the word of god it is the word of god that brings healing power water is no more than an agent through which naaman receives the healing power of god
9339039 suppose there is another sick man that see how naaman is healed by dipping into water and he also jumps into that same water he will not be healed
9339040 for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect
9339041 to them which believe no explanation is necessary to them which believe not no explanation is possible
9339042 when was naaman healed was he healed before or after he dipped 7 times when did the walls fall down did they fall down before or after israel marched and blew the trumpets when was the blind man healed was he healed before or after he washed in the pool of siloam
9339043 oh you believe in water as the power to wash away sin
9339044 he said unto them have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed
9339045 and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost
9339046 and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto johns baptism
9339047 then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus
9339048 when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
9339049 and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied
9339050 when did the jews call on the name of the lord in acts 2 when did paul call on the name of the lord in acts 9
9339051 the one who hears and does not do what jesus says or is the wise man one who hears and does
9339052 for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins
9339053 jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
9339054 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth for ever
9339055 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9339056 and obeying the commands to of dipping marching and washing did not rob the lord of his power
9339057 for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel
9339058 acts 19 6 you see there is no contradiction between acts 8 and acts 19 both people in acts 8 and acts 19 receive the word of god but they either dont know people in acts 19 or dont understand people in acts 8 the gospel in both cases the apostles come and help those people to be saved i e to receive the holy ghost by explaining the gospel to them first then laying hands on them a miracle
9339059 and even simon himself believed and after being baptized he continued on with philip
9339060 who is the wise man who is the foolish man
9339061 and having been made perfect he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation
9339062 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
9339063 arise and be baptized washing away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
9339064 your problem is that you need to realize god never ask us to do anything except to believe in jesus christ alone to be saved
9339065 you ask some strange questions i dont know why you ask those questions i never say that the jews call on the name of the lord in acts 2 and paul calls on the name of the lord in acts 9
9339066 for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
9339067 and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost
9339068 for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel
9339069 but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness
9339070 you mention repentance well you have said only believe faith alone saves now you say repentance is necessary
9339071 did the jews in acts 2 call on the name of the lord
9339072 did paul in acts 9 call on the name of the lord
9339073 as far as the blood of jesus christ taking away the sin of the world i do not deny that
9339074 and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
9339075 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved
9339076 here is the problem with the people in acts 8
9339077 oh no the samaritans only believed in the name of jesus they werent saved
9339078 now i quote two verses and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
9339079 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved
9339080 arise and be baptized washing away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
9339081 did the jews in acts 2 call on the name of the lord
9339082 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit
9339083 repentance and faith in jesus are inseparable and indistinguishable in the moment of salvation
9339084 repentance and faith in jesus are inseparable and indistinguishable in the moment of salvation
9339085 and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever
9339086 and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption
9339087 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his
9339088 so according to you obeying the gospel doesnt save but now you affirm that not even believing in the name of jesus saves
9339089 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
9339090 for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel
9339091 do you know the difference between the blood shed on the cross and being forgiven as an individual
9339092 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9339093 now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before god
9339094 under judgment one who lost his suit of liable to punishment from god
9339095 john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins
9339096 then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
9339097 and the hand of the lord was with them and a great number believed and turned unto the lord
9339098 they only receive the holy spirit after the apostles come explaining to them the gospel then laying hands on them
9339099 please note that no mention of baptism is found in acts 11 other than the one reference to john the baptist in verse 16
9339100 why tarriest thou arise and be baptized washing away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
9339101 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
9339102 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
9339103 now on the blood of jesus christ on the cross you ask
9339104 why tarriest thou arise and be baptized washing away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
9339105 for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect
9339106 oh faith in the blood only is nonsense so i must have something else some non blood things
9339107 are you absolutely confident that every ones sins were forgiven when jesus died
9339108 faith without works is dead therefore you believe that dead faith saves
9339109 yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works shew me thy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by my works
9339110 ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only
9339111 for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart
9339112 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new
9339113 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
9339114 for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel
9339115 look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else
9339116 ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only
9339117 ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only
9339118 the king james translators didnt know what they were doing
9339119 these people want to know what to do to be saved
9339120 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus who ye have crucified both lord and christ
9339121 for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect
9339122 hey we need to get baptized in order to be saved
9339123 for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9339124 a part of the bible in a way that contradicts with other parts of the bible then our understanding is wrong
9339125 no honest person can read the bible as a whole and then proclaims
9339126 on acts 2 38 as you say many bible christians response to that verse in different ways
9339127 others like dr john rice focus on the context of acts 2 38 which is the jews question on salvation remember the jews reject the lord jesus christ so peter here wants to emphasize the fact that it is jesus who is the true messiah
9339128 some others including me believe that people just misunderstand the word
9339129 for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9339130 peter repent and get baptized in the name of jesus because all your sins are forgiven and you shall have the gift of the holy ghost
9339131 i believe the message peter wants to proclaim to the jews in acts 2 38 is that jesus is the true messiah and all the sins of the world including the sins of the jews are forgiven by his sacrifice on the cross
9339132 im saved i know im saved so it doesnt matter
9339133 yes i agree we ought not to argue if two people cant disagree agreeably then something is wrong with both of them i read most all of the intercourse between you and r robinson and there seemed to be a lot of that frustration there and it all ended kind of abruptly it just seems to me that maybe both sides are missing something
9339134 the best way to interpret the bible is not interpret it at all
9339135 im not saying theyre right but to think that it is obvious to the world how to get saved is contradictory to the bible
9339136 are we saying the king james translator messed up one of the most pivotal verses in the bible and has thrown the whole world into confusion are we saying that god has failed at preserving the original intent of the text i dont want to go there so i wont
9339137 yes you are right but then he totally ignores the text and his own thesis when he continues on in his interpretation blatently i love john r rice but i dont know
9339138 thats a neat argument but anybody with a little education will never swallow that
9339139 okay heres the new stuff church of christ wouldnt see this either because theyre making the same mistake we are is that really the message that peter is preaching in acts chapter 2 i agree hes preaching that jesus is the true messiah but the rest of that though it is a truth taught throughout the gospels and epistles and the entire bible it is not the topic of acts 2 38 that is where we missed it nowhere in acts chapter 2 will you find a reference to christs death as being sacrificial or substitionary or even atoning the message simply and only addresses the murder of christ by the house of israel

9339142 if you had to pick one song that best defined jazz for a person who didnt know anything about the music which song would you choose
9339143 a man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject knowing that he that is such is subverted and sinneth being condemned of himself
9339144 yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution
9339145 as the scripture saith here are just a few scriptures strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearers
9339146 the apostle paul is simply saying that if a person doesnt want to get saved then they are digging their own grave because judgment day is coming life is short friend
9339147 do you like to be told your views are wrong
9339148 youre pretty much calling the catholic religion and all of its worshipers blaspheming hell raisers which is not true
9339149 i am not catholic but i dont believe that it is your right to decide who is declared blasphemic and who is not
9339150 i dont believe that it is your right to decide who is declared blasphemic and who is not
9339151 you do realize that being like this wont get you into heaven right
9339152 they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols
9339153 hanging on the cross in their homes so they can visualize the object of their worship perhaps they think the crucifix is a good luck charm they will vehemently tell you that they dont worship the images however ive seen many pictures of the bible says dont even make images
9339154 if the catholic religion deletes a commandment how do they still come up with ten commandments
9339155 these are the ten commandments from exodus chapter 20 in the
9339156 thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them
9339157 with the protestant listing we get to make women objects to be coveted
9339158 you shall not covet your neighbors wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his ox or his ass or anything that is your neighbors
9339159 i the lord am your god you shall not have other gods besides me
9339160 since you saw no form on the day that the lord spoke to you at horeb out of the midst of the fire beware lest you act corruptly by making a graven image for yourselves in the form of any figure
9339161 66 it is the absolutely transcendent god who revealed himself to israel
9339162 the honor rendered to an image passes to its prototype
9339163 whoever venerates an image venerates the person portrayed in it
9339164 thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them
9339165 isnt completely omitted it is part of the first commandment see the catholic catechism
9339166 even their own perverted bibles have something that approximates the commandment to not make images but since their leaders tell them they are too spiritually dumb to understand the bible they dont read it or read it with muddy eyeballs and so the wicked deceitfully change the ten commandments and put them in a book somewhere or post them on a wall and tell the people to memorize them of course people are going to trust their almighty priests to tell them the truth
9339167 nevertheless already in the old testament god ordained or permitted the making of images that pointed symbolically toward salvation by the incarnate word so it was with the bronze serpent the ark of the covenant and the cherubim
9339168 religious worship is not directed to images in themselves considered as mere things but under their distinctive aspect as images leading us on to god incarnate
9339169 any likeness above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth
9339170 in sharp contrast with that statement the second commandment of god forbids us to even make images of
9339171 this cup is the new covenant in my blood do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me
9339172 did god permit or not permit images and symbols to point symbolically toward salvation
9339173 yes the catholic church says these images and symbols are symbolic the catholic church does not teach that people should worship the images
9339174 sometimes in movies a teenage girl will kiss a picture of a boy she has a crush on does that mean she thinks that is the real person
9339175 the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of christ
9339176 ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils ye cannot be partakers of the lords table and of the table of devils
9339177 after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me
9339178 this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me
9339179 for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do shew the lords death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lords body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged
9339180 if it isnt truly the body and blood of jesus you are right and i would be one of the guiltiest blasphemers and breakers of the 1st and your 2nd commandment every wed morning i go into a small chapel and sit in front of the eucharist believing i am praying and sitting in the presence of jesus every sunday at mass when i enter the nave of the church i genuflect towards my king in the eucharist kept in a tabernacle before i take my seat during communion i believe that i am truly consumming the flesh of jesus christ the bread of life so if it isnt truly the body and blood of jesus than i am guilty as charged
9339181 ha ha you are sinners you will go to hell so bye bye and good luck
9339182 and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom
9339183 and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee to day shalt thou be with me in paradise
9339184 hmm so you want to be saved ok here is a list of laws regulations rituals etc you must keep it and i will consider your case when you die
9339185 i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
9339186 wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth
9339187 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
9339188 but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do
9339189 after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever amen
9339190 it is the word of god that sanctifies us sets us apart
9339191 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9339192 and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day
9339193 he answered and said unto them well hath esaias prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written this people honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things ye do and he said unto them full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition
9339194 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
9339195 i am the lord that is my name and my glory will i not give to another neither my praise to graven images
9339196 let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind
9339197 the rosary is the most powerful weapon to touch the heart of jesus our redeemer who so loves his mother
9339198 who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth
9339199 at one stage his comics other literature was available almost every christian bookshop here in my hometown pretoria not anymore its regarded as hate speech
9339200 for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved
9339201 he answered and said unto them well hath esaias prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written this people honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things ye do and he said unto them full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition
9339202 o generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh
9339203 jesus christ is the head of the rcc the pope the earthly head
9339204 how would you or anyone else like it if your church fellowship was referred to as the great whore of babylon
9339205 your jesus my jesus are one the same there is only one jesus christ saviour of us all
9339206 tradition dating from the 13th century this knowledge has come down as a revelation to elect saints from a remote past and preserved only by a privileged few
9339207 god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth
9339208 kabbalah is a satanic religion which worships a false god
9339209 the word torah is a tricky one because it can mean different things in different contexts in its most limited sense torah refers to the five books of genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy but the word torah can also be used to refer to the entire jewish bible the body of scripture known to non jews as the old testament and to jews as the tanakh or written torah or in its broadest sense to the whole body of jewish law and teachings to jews there is no old testament the books that christians call the new testament are not part of jewish scripture the so called old testament is known to us as written torah or the tanakh
9339210 it wouldnt have made any sense for the author of the five books to have left us nothing more than tantalizing hints we still would have no idea what to do
9339211 every jew who rejects christ as personal savior will burn in the lake of fire one day
9339212 most people do not knowingly go towards lucifer who is appropriately called satan
9339213 kabbalism is a system of jewish mysticism and magic and is the foundational element in modern witchcraft virtually all of the great witches and sorcerers of this century were kabbalists
9339214 please explain if kabbalah was written before the 15th century how can the authors you suggest be the authors of kabbalah theyre all 19th 20th century
9339215 since both jews and xtians believe that there is only one god then why are you suggesting the existence of 2 the god of kabbalah and the god of the xtians
9339216 sadly you would never accapt any evidence or proof that you might be wrong rather like the fundamentalist view of science very valuable but if science and bible disagree then science must be wrong
9339217 here is the rock that has the age of one million year old so your bible is wrong
9339218 the red liquid that ran through the veins and arteries of jesus mortal body is not related to our salvation and there is no biblical basis for attributing any unusual properties to christs bodily fluids
9339219 using his reasoning then why would god have told the old testament high priest to apply the slain lambs blood to the mercy seat why not just kill the lamb if thieme is correct and the blood of christ wasnt intended to take away our sins then why did god require the
9339220 knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst
9339221 external bleeding was not the cause of death he did not bleed to death
9339222 christ anticipated that satan would attack the cross by perverting the meaning of the blood in an attempt to obscure the importance of spiritual death thus while on the cross our lord provided proof that he did not bleed to death and that unlike the blood of a sacrificial animal his literal blood has no spiritual significance
9339223 in contrast the word of god states in hebrews 9 23
9339224 thieme actually claims that the blood of old testament animals had significance but not the blood of jesus
9339225 christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but now to appear in the presence of god for us
9339226 thieme is sly like a snake and states on page 27
9339227 when hebrews 9 22 states that without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness animal blood is in view the entire context of that passage relates the shadow christology on animal sacrifices to their fulfillment in the reality of christ
9339228 by the blood of jesus you see friend you cant be deceived if youll read and study the word of god thieme is deceiving multitudes of ignorant people who blindly trust his teachings because they dont go to the word of god for themselves by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us did you read that this scripture blows r b thieme jr and john macarthur right out of the water jesus entered in once into the holy place thieme teaches that christ did ascend into heaven and enter into the holy of holies presenting himself as a sacrifice but thieme states on page 31 not take any blood with him to heaven
9339229 why is thieme making this up whoever said that the blood of christ referred to anything the blood of jesus stands alone and does
9339230 but it is no more bizarre than the false idea that the blood of christ is somehow a literal phrase yet how many christians believe just that
9339231 we have seen that literal blood cannot bring man eternal life and that christs blood is a representative analogy which describes his spiritual death
9339232 we have seen in great detail that his mortal human body fluids have absolutely nothing whatever to do with salvation
9339233 but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh
9339234 forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers
9339235 extensive academic training in greek hebrew theology history and textual criticism
9339236 mr thieme is an imposter who teaches damnable heresies by denying the efficacy of christs blood thieme denies christ himself
9339237 therefore thou son of man say unto the children of thy people the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression as for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth when i shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live and commit iniquity all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered but for his iniquity that he hath committed he shall die for it
9339238 for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
9339239 as a necessity to ones eternal salvation the damnable heresy that a believer can lose salvation is nothing less than a form of lordship salvation whereas the
9339240 just because we are saved by faith without works does not give us a
9339241 but if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sins and does the same detestable things the wicked man does will he live
9339242 will he live if he departs from his righteous ways
9339243 none of the righteous things he has done will be remembered
9339244 when i shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live and commit iniquity all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered in his own righteousness
9339245 to claim that a believer can lose salvation is to say that one who is a new creature i
9339246 worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly
9339247 for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
9339248 for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god
9339249 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth for ever
9339250 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise
9339251 if you quit believing do you still have access to the grace of jesus christ
9339252 take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end
9339253 moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain
9339254 and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul am made a minister
9339255 if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel
9339256 earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints
9339257 and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations
9339258 for whosoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god
9339259 and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations
9339260 take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end
9339261 fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life
9339262 and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads
9339263 and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority
9339264 and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him
9339265 and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast
9339266 and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty
9339267 behold the hope of him is in vain shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him
9339268 who can open the doors of his face his teeth are terrible round about
9339269 out of his mouth go burning lamps and sparks of fire leap out
9339270 upon earth there is not his like who is made without fear
9339271 and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years
9339272 if you were to research dragon properly you will find they actually represent peace
9339273 what makes you believe that the bible is referring to dragon as far as i know no one has even seen a dragon in real life
9339274 an evil does not draw me to them i just find them so amazing
9339275 how do you know the bible has not been tampered with i been watching alot of documentarys on the bible lately an they always going on how the roman catholics used to change things to suite them
9339276 i think that dragons cant be only evil no offense its the same if you would say that all the people are good and u know that aint true
9339277 the sectors to look at in the us are the areas that have been beaten up the financial sector real estate hotels and resorts right now thats what we are looking at
9339278 therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for
9339279 christians at best are people and people at best are sinners
9339280 for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved
9339281 nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let every one that nameth the name of christ
9339282 i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
9339283 jesus said to them that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem
9339284 the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
9339285 howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men
9339286 the children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the women knead their dough to make cakes to the
9339287 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light
9339288 orthodox catholic church is a title used by many different groups that are affiliated neither with the worldwide orthodox communion nor with the roman catholic church nor with the anglican communion
9339289 there is no bigger group of liars today than the charismatic crowd from pat robertsons
9339290 about falling on the floor during a church service and laughing uncontrollably like an idiot
9339291 christianity today sept 3 1991 the bible clearly forbids women from taking charge in the church over men or leading men women are to remain silent during church services and show respect for the men of the church feminism is a demonic philosophy which has crept into most of americas churches as a tragic consequence divorce has skyrocketed and our churches have been infested with all sorts of doctrines of devils 1st timothy 4 1 ye are mad
9339292 but all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments and love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets and to be called of men rabbi rabbi but be not ye called rabbi for one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven
9339293 that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth
9339294 the message of fatima imposes an obligation on the church
9339295 my immaculate heart will triumph the holy father will consecrate russia to me which will be converted and a period of peace will be granted to mankind
9339296 our lady said that many souls would be saved from hell and the annihilation of nations averted if in time devotion to her immaculate heart were established
9339297 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
9339298 the children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the women knead their dough to make cakes to the
9339299 that so many of the thousands of protestant sects do not know how to honour the mother of god proves that you worship a false god
9339300 baptism is properly administered to infants is something owed to them
9339301 to these sentiments the reformers could agree so what was the problem with servetus his trouble was twofold
9339302 a doctrine of the devil an invention of popery and a total subversion of christianity
9339303 he wrote two letters to calvin on adult baptism and exhorted him to follow his example
9339304 regarding the trinity servetus was not a unitarian but had a strange view of the trinity in a great measure peculiar to himself
9339305 at twelve noon on october 27 1553 servetus passed into his eternal destiny
9339306 how can you even believe in christianity look at how bad the apostles were
9339307 well all those calvinists in history who did all those things they were really unitarians if you want to know the truth
9339308 well boys here they are like em or lump em
9339309 you should actually study your subject before attempting to use cliche and tired worn out hearsay to bash calvinism
9339310 church history is heavily in favor of the doctrines of grace calvinistic thought over pelagian and semi pelagian arminian thought
9339311 calvin was a fallible and sinful human being just like me and you
9339312 the five points are based in nothing but the bible
9339313 t he offending of human nature is sometimes the first step towards bringing it to bow itself before god
9339314 when a person preaches against what have been known as the doctrines of grace i hate the term calvinism btw i cor 1 12 13 they are by default preaching romanism if you dont believe me read the first few chapters of the official rc catechism its all there in black and white
9339315 i also know well what the p stands for and in short it means that he which has begun a good work in you will complete it it means all that come to me jesus i will lose nothing but will raise him up at the last day it means that he who predestinated the saints to be conformed to the image of his son he also justified and them he justified he also glorified it means that the good shepherd looses none of his sheep it means that nothing shall separate us from the love of christ that is the doctrine and that is what scripture teaches
9339316 predestination as is taught in your paper is totally wrong
9339317 i want to control this world because i love it
9339318 i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live
9339319 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9339320 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
9339321 did god love pharaoh did god love esau did god love the babylonians did god love the philistines did god love judas the scriptures reveal the lord trieth the righteous but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth
9339322 where does god fit in the picture and whatever part it was for why you came to both hear and believe the gospel you get the glory because you chose and others did not
9339323 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9339324 and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world
9339325 for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the living god who is the saviour of all men specially of those that believe
9339326 to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins
9339327 and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not for i came not to judge the world but to save the world
9339328 for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men
9339329 let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely
9339330 thank god for the truth and for the blood of jesus christ which takes our sins away
9339331 in luke 15 11 27 jesus told the story of the prodigal son who had left his fathers home taking his inheritance with him
9339332 in other words the son foolishly wasted his money on wine women and song etc
9339333 when people finished eating the corn off the husk theyd give the husks to the pigs to eat i
9339334 to turn upon a thing to have a desire for
9339335 in the case of the prodigal son it was garbage instead of gravel
9339336 in proverb 20 17 is referring to a person being buried and dirt being thrown down into the grave
9339337 we are living in times of great apostasy when most churches are following the world and fewer lost sinners are truly finding salvation in christ jesus
9339338 a christian cannot be right with god and wrong with man i
9339339 many people need to come to themselves in this matter of justice and reconciliation for they are living in sin by refusing to right their wrongs against others
9339340 god does not require anything from us to be saved just that we believe upon jesus christ who justifies the ungodly with his shed blood 1st peter 1 18 19 therefore catholicism is a lie islam is a lie the
9339341 which is a misnomer all rock music is of the devil
9339342 im a singer not a preacher im not looking to convert anybody i feel people come to hear my music not to hear me talk
9339343 miss grant needs to wake up as did the prodigal son because she is living in spiritual poverty with the pigs
9339344 who are easily deceived may the lord bless you with a desire to seek after the truth that you may be enlightened wake up wake up america
9339345 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
9339346 ive noticed in my 51 years of life on earth that those who rail against any subject the loudest are usually trying to steer people to believe the person railing is against whatever he rails against when in fact the person is actually guilty of this behavior or at least leans toward it and because he feels such terrible guilt so makes out as if hes 4 square against it
9339347 i dont much like to imagine what it is homosexuals do in the privacy of their bedrooms and public toilet stalls but then again i dont want to imagine godly men and women in the throes of marital intercourse either
9339348 and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as the lord had commanded and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now the magicians of egypt they also did in like manner with their enchantments for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents but aarons rod swallowed up their rods
9339349 then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now the magicians of egypt they also did in like manner with their enchantments the magicians of egypt did so with their enchantments and pharaohs heart was hardened neither did he hearken unto them as the lord had said
9339350 and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them and to whomsoever i will i give it
9339351 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures the bible is history written in advance the following verses from the book of revelation reveals that the antichrist will perform miracles to deceive the masses deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live
9339352 by christ matthew 15 29 31 mark 7 31 37
9339353 criss angel is and illusionist a performance artist are you going to say that houdini and david copperfield are evil then
9339354 hey folks look how i can do the miracles of jesus christ
9339355 another thing that id like to mention is that you are debasing catholics which is painting with a pretty wide stroke and hypocritical seeing as how chritians are supposedly tolerant and dont judge others
9339356 i wouldnt have a problem with religion if it didnt control so many people tear them apart and cause wars and the fact that all religion has copied from another at one point and are based on mythologies
9339357 ever think that truth is what you each individual make it life is how you perceive it you ultimately choose your
9339358 it is true that we have the right to murder others
9339359 ever think that truth is what you each individual make it life is how you perceive it you ultimately choose your
9339360 it is true that we have the right to murder others
9339361 i simply do not agree with any organized religions they really are the embodiment of mass deception and yes i think christianity is a religion
9339362 christianity started as a personal relationship with god when it came to greek it became a philosophy when it came to rome it became a religious organization when it came to europe it became a culture when it came to america it became a business
9339363 i would also like to point out that lack of christian belief does not mean that there is lack of moral within an individual
9339364 its my personal choice to not lie steal fornicate kill etc
9339365 i dont see god as a personified novel type character and i find it humorous that an all powerful being has a gender further proving that religion is biased and sexist
9339366 if only we could all just agree to disagree live and let live there would be a lot less killing that is what war is about disagreeing and wanting control because we all have to defend our beliefs and then greed and lust and im done for the night
9339367 means agreeing on a small common denominator of christian truth while tolerating great areas of disagreement in essence lewis book is an attempt to corrupt the church apostates and false religions praise c s lewis
9339368 has come to be the aquinas the augustine and the aesop of contemporary evangelicalism
9339369 to continue the legacy of c s lewis a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
9339370 for we have good reason to believe that animals existed long before men for long centuries god perfected the animal form which was to become the vehicle of humanity and the image of himself eventually god caused a new kind of consciousness to descend upon this organism
9339371 but he man remains still a primate and an animal
9339372 if you mean simply that man is physically descended from animals i have no objection
9339373 he made an earth at first without form and void and brought it by degrees to its perfection
9339374 pregnancy has been long and painful and anxious but it has reached its climax
9339375 i have therefore no difficulty accepting say the view of those scholars who tell us that the account of creation in genesis is derived from earlier semitic stories which were pagan and mythical
9339376 when the consequence is drawn that since we are totally depraved our idea of good is worth simply nothing may thus turn christianity into a form of devil worship
9339377 from ours not as white and black but as a perfect circle from a childs first attempt to draw a wheel
9339378 into a higher form of human culture new age boldly rejects the biblical teaching that mans heart is desperately wicked and deceitful above all else jeremiah 17 9 total depravity was rejected by lewis
9339379 if we were totally depraved we could not know ourselves to be depraved
9339380 experience shows that there is much goodness in human nature
9339381 there are people in other religions who are being led by gods secret influence to concentrate on those parts of their religion which are in agreement with christianity and who thus belong to christ without knowing it for example a buddhist of good will may be led to concentrate more and more on the buddhist teaching about mercy and to leave in the background though he might still say he believed the buddhist teaching on certain points many of the good pagans long before christs birth may have been in this position
9339382 there are three things that spread the christ life to us baptism belief and that mysterious action which different christians call by different names holy communion the mass the lords supper
9339383 this new life is spread not only by purely mental acts like belief but by bodily acts like baptism and holy communion
9339384 there will be every occasion for being the sort of people that we can become only as the result of doing such acts here
9339385 often makes prizes of humans who have given their lives for causes he thinks bad on the monstrously sophistical ground that the humans thought them good and were following the best they knew
9339386 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me
9339387 his prayers for the dead belief in purgatory and rejection of the literal resurrection of the body are serious deviations from biblical christianity
9339388 there are people a great many of them who are slowly ceasing to be christians
9339389 a christian can lose the christ life which has been put into him and he has to make efforts to keep it
9339390 the point is not that god will refuse you admission to his eternal world if you have not certain qualities of character the point is that if people have not got at least the beginnings of those qualities inside them then no possible external conditions could make a heaven for them
9339391 all the scriptural imagery harps crowns gold etc is of course a merely symbolical attempt to express the inexpressible musical instruments are mentioned because for many people not all music is the thing known in the present life which most strongly suggests ecstasy and infinity crowns are mentioned to suggest the fact that those who are united with god in eternity share his splendor and power and joy gold is mentioned to suggest the timelessness of heaven gold does not rust and the preciousness of it
9339392 every shutting up of the creature within the dungeon of its own mind is in the end hell
9339393 i have the deepest respect for pagan myths still more for myths in the holy scriptures
9339394 it appears from his writings and statements that he is not saved
9339395 for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart
9339396 this fact alone ought to show you that lewis was a heretic i mean mormonism is a false religion a perverted sex cult and they honor lewis
9339397 its a shame there are christians as judgmental as the display presented here today jesus did tell us not to judge others did he not
9339398 youll see more christianity there than ive seen at some christian concerts that ive been to
9339399 my preference when speaking of his salvation would be to say something like
9339400 fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints flds
9339401 titus 3 5 says that such acts of righteousness do not save us
9339402 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost
9339403 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
9339404 he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him
9339405 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life
9339406 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
9339407 or pointing toward the remission of your sins the remission of your sins
9339408 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
9339409 that makes it clear that the matter which settles it is believing just the same as is taught in john 3 18
9339410 he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god
9339411 no they are not the same and are nowhere spoken of as the same in the bible nor is it ever stated in the bible that believing includes baptism nor that if one trusts christ he will be baptized
9339412 in john 3 5 is often quoted as if it referred to baptism
9339413 the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the holy ghost
9339414 by this birth of water and the spirit or cleansing of regeneration and being made alive by the holy spirit
9339415 all of that happens on the inside of every sinner who is born of god
9339416 i peter 3 21 is used as an argument that baptism saves people
9339417 the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ
9339418 baptism then is only a picture or figure of salvation and the man who is baptized should already have a
9339419 in hebrews 9 14 we are told how the conscience is to be purged by the blood of christ
9339420 for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ
9339421 the whole book of galatians is written to prove that people are saved not by works but by faith
9339422 in romans 6 3 with a phrase just like them in i corinthians 10 2
9339423 the word unto is a translation of the same greek word
9339424 what the lord says here is that as many as have been baptized for christ or pointing toward christ or picturing christ have publicly claimed him before the world as their saviour
9339425 of the death and resurrection of christ and also pictures the new life which the christians plan to live
9339426 and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
9339427 brother saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost
9339428 nor did he mean acts 22 16 to contradict acts 13 39 where he told the people at antioch
9339429 to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins
9339430 and he said to the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace
9339431 and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee
9339432 i tell you this man went down to his house justified
9339433 baptism follows should follow immediately but is not a part of gods plan of salvation
9339434 remember that baptism is a figure or picture according to i peter 3 21 and romans 6 5
9339435 i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed
9339436 for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect
9339437 howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition
9339438 will they go to heaven just by using the name of jesus i know the bible says everybody who calls upon the name of the lord and that day shall be saved
9339439 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
9339440 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation
9339441 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven
9339442 and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day
9339443 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9339444 and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely
9339445 and brought them out and said sirs thou shalt be saved and thy house
9339446 now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may
9339447 real repentance is putting your trust in jesus christ so you will not live like that anymore
9339448 i promised i wouldnt do those things anymore and he saved me
9339449 but these are written that ye might that jesus is the christ the son of god and that have life through his name
9339450 when you get saved you get saved not because you deserve it but because you simply let god save you and because you confess your own poor sinful state and your inability to save yourself
9339451 the change in your heart sinner is gods part and you may be sure he will attend to that your part is to simply believe in him whatever else is necessary in your eternal salvation the lord attends to when you trust in him or believe in him
9339452 so many little children love chick tracts theyre like eye candy to people surely jack chick must be doing a good thing
9339453 turn from your sins for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
9339454 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit
9339455 profess to know god but they deny him by their works
9339456 we must call evil evil but not our brothers who are reaching out to the lost if our brother is blind then we need to pray that their eye of understanding be made opened that is brotherly love all the debate about what is true salvation or not is not helping the needy the lost or the dying they just need the engrafted word of liberty it is water for the thirsty man in the desert he is not concerned how the water reached him he just wants the drink
9339457 beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves
9339458 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god
9339459 i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed
9339460 there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ
9339461 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light
9339462 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the lord
9339463 but when jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god
9339464 and ye will not come to me that ye might have life
9339465 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves
9339466 but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ
9339467 with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved
9339468 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness
9339469 for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers
9339470 for as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you
9339471 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness
9339472 the reason you reject sacred tradition as the apostolic era and church fathers confirm is that with the coming of the protestant reformation sacred tradition as a source of divine revelation is rejected and only sacred scripture is to be accepted this in itself is a tradition of protestantism
9339473 then the pharisees and scribes asked jesus why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashen hands he answered and said unto them well hath esaias prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written jesus is quoting the bible this people honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of men and he said unto them full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition making the word of god of none effect through your tradition which ye have delivered and many such like things do ye
9339474 consider my friend the obstinacy and hatred that your site envokes to the reader did this come from a heart full of the love of christ in the unity of the holy spirit or was it born inherited from what i suggest above
9339475 the sacred scriptures the canons from the original collectors the catholic church
9339476 your response to my last comment was very harsh you condemned me
9339477 those are idle words you have called me a liar
9339478 i will never leave the catholic church not because i am afraid to but because jesus christ is alive present within roman catholicism
9339479 for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved
9339480 then the pharisees and scribes asked jesus why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashen hands he answered and said unto them well hath esaias prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written jesus is quoting the bible this people honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of men and he said unto them full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition making the word of god of none effect through your tradition which ye have delivered and many such like things do ye
9339481 hi once again you keep on telling me to read my bible i have told you previously that i do read the bible i have several translations kjv nkj niv good news living the new jerusalem the new jerusalem bibles
9339482 jesus was not a wimp or a sissy but he preached love big time the bible states god is love i dont understand your pure hatred of the rcc
9339483 well you are wrong but because i love you i will tell you that you are right
9339484 there is only one saviour his name is jesus christ regardless of how where i choose to worship him he is mine i am his no matter which translation of the bible one reads john 3 v 16 says it like it is
9339485 i do not worship them or mary the mother of jesus mary cannot twist gods arm if it is not his will to grant an answer to our prayer thats that
9339486 the catholic church has never taught that mary is part of the trinity or co equal with the trinity after vatican council 11 there have been many changes within the catholic church a lot of the prayers to mary which you have on your web i dont even know
9339487 i dont believe that mary is a co redeemer jesus christ is the only redeemer of humankind
9339488 by the way our good works alone are not a ticket to heaven its our faith in christ accompanied by good works james 2 refers justification
9339489 the priest doesnt give absolution in his name he says i absolve you from your sins in the name of the father of the son of the holy spirit
9339490 we call our priests father because paul said for in your life in union with christ jesus i have become your father by bringing the good news to you 1 cor 4 v 14 16
9339491 i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you for though ye have ten thousand instructers in christ yet have ye not many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel wherefore i beseech you be ye followers of me
9339492 you must also remember that 7 books were removed from the old testament which catholics still regard as part of holy scripture
9339493 we will all be judged individually by the only one who has the authority to decide who is saved who is not
9339494 i think you are a behrean sorry if incorrectly spelt
9339495 love does no wrong to a neighbour therefore love is the fulfilling of the law
9339496 and was to be celebrated fifty days after the feast of firstfruits
9339497 but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept
9339498 three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles and they shall not appear before the lord empty
9339499 and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me
9339500 and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place
9339501 and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
9339502 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you
9339503 but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth
9339504 nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away
9339505 until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the christs last instructions to his apostles were of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high
9339506 for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence
9339507 them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father notice carefully that those which were baptized and filled with controlled by the holy spirit spoke with other tongues languages but this was not the result of asking praying seeking or begging for the holy spirit the holy spirit came at the appointed time to fulfill gods promise that after christ ascended back to heaven he christ would not leave them comfortless john 14 17 18 remember the feast of pentecost was celebrated fifty days after the feast of firstfruits christ fulfilled the feast of firstfruits when he arose from the grave 1st corinthians 15 20 23 he then walked forty days with them acts 1 3 before ascending back to heaven acts 1 9 they were to receive the holy spirit as promised the holy spirit would not have come any sooner or later but only at the appointed time set by god the holy spirit was not the object of mans will by praying begging or seeking but the object of gods will by promise tongues
9339508 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues
9339509 the proof that these tongues were known languages is the fact that
9339510 do you remember what the lord told the church of laodicea in revelation 3 15 16
9339511 believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world
9339512 and when they shall say unto you seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter should not a people seek unto their god for the living to the dead
9339513 the soothsayers caused a low sound to proceed as from a grave or a dead person
9339514 to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them
9339515 it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in man
9339516 in each case the proper interpretation may be found by reading the whole context and letting other passages shed light on it for example let us look at three
9339517 moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all
9339518 else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead
9339519 i am come to send fire on the earth and what will i if it be already kindled but i have a baptism to be baptized with and how am i straitened till it be accomplished
9339520 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all
9339521 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord
9339522 ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ
9339523 for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another
9339524 the baptizer is not a minister or a body of water
9339525 for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ
9339526 for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus
9339527 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name
9339528 whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power
9339529 if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to you ward how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote afore in few words whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now prophets by the spirit
9339530 ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence
9339531 on pentecost and every christian from then until the rapture has been indwelt by the holy spirit
9339532 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you
9339533 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
9339534 as we have noted we are nowhere commanded in scripture to be baptized with or in the holy spirit it is simultaneous with salvation we
9339535 and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit
9339536 and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is
9339537 since we are commanded to be filled or controlled by the holy spirit we never have to pray for it it now becomes a matter of obedience and yieldedness it is not a matter of getting more of the holy spirit but of yielding more of ourselves for the holy spirits use when we are saved we get a new nature in the person of the holy spirit who indwells each believer permanently we still have the old nature which seeks to control our lives controlled by in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would
9339538 likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof
9339539 these groups say paul was not saved yet but paul said in romans 7 22
9339540 does this yes paul was saved when he wrote this when we yield to the holy spirit we are controlled by the holy spirit and the fruits of the spirit will prevail
9339541 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law
9339542 of christ he will suffer loss of rewards but not loss of salvation christian only work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire
9339543 for a young man you have an amazing understanding of gods word
9339544 not all independent bible churches on your church list agree with your excellent and biblical statement of faith i have attended several churches on your list and were very disappointed with their doctrine and teaching
9339545 i would take issue with your inference that believers should not take positions to expose political lies our congregations need to know what politicians believe if they intend to vote
9339546 and he said unto them render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesars and unto god the things which be gods
9339547 but if the government tells me not to witness the christian faith to other people i will not obey because that contradicts with the bible
9339548 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
9339549 jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
9339550 as it is written there is none righteous no not one romans 6 23
9339551 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned
9339552 in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ
9339553 and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
9339554 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
9339555 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
9339556 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9339557 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief
9339558 forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of christ
9339559 jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live john 14 6
9339560 and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day
9339561 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
9339562 to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me
9339563 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
9339564 for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ
9339565 for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus
9339566 worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness
9339567 the only sin which can prevent a person from being saved is unbelief thus unbelief is the only sin which a person needs to repent of to be saved what a wonderful savior
9339568 do you know that your articles are full of fallacy and nonsense have you ever considered that you might be one of the anti christ
9339569 do you know that magicians are not considered an anti christ christians are just prohibited to practice magic or even consulting them but surely they are not anti christ you are one of the anti christ your denomination is one of the great great grandchild of the mother of harlots and abominations
9339570 do you know who are the harlots and abominations in revelation 17 5
9339571 but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him
9339572 if one must be willing to do anything to get it
9339573 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
9339574 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9339575 to be saved then it is no longer a free gift only god knows how many people have been steered
9339576 to forsake certain sins in their life in sharp contrast the bible declares in romans 4 5 his faith is counted for righteousness
9339577 for i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
9339578 galatians 1 6 9 which is based upon self righteousness lordship salvation is diametrically opposed to the gift of god a genuine gift is free with no strings attached proponents of lordship salvation claim to believe that eternal life is a gift yet they completely contradict themselves when they teach that a sinner must be willing to surrender to christs will and forsake sin to be saved it is clear from 1 carnal
9339579 acts 10 43 its a very simple yet powerful truth please dont become a victim of lordship salvation if youve already bought into the lie then i plead with you to as jesus commanded in john 5 39 i realize that there are hundreds if not thousands of different gospels floating around on the internet nowadays however there is only one genuine gospel message presented in the scriptures and it is a message of gods unconditional love for us undeserving sinners who sent his only begotten son into the world to pay for our sins so he could freely offer us the gift of eternal life in christ jesus revelation 22 17 you dont have to be willing to do anything to be saved all that is required for salvation is that you come as a guilty sinner romans 3 19 and believe on the lord jesus christ to forgive your sins acts 16 30 31 you dont have to surrender your life to christ to be saved in romans 12 1 3 we find the apostle paul begging the believers at rome to surrender their lives to christ brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service
9339580 in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power
9339581 every one that is of the truth heareth my voice
9339582 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth for ever
9339583 thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble
9339584 not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
9339585 that you could have freely received by faith in jesus christ but you didnt because of your sinful pride and love for sin john 3 20 you could have went to heaven simply by the taking but you went to hell because of your sinful unbelief and contempt for the lord jesus christ you
9339586 of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace
9339587 do you mean to tell me i can get saved and live anyway i want i can murder steal commit adultery yes
9339588 real repentance is putting your trust in jesus christ so you will not live like that anymore
9339589 jesus came to save us from the condemnation penalty and guilt of sin this is why jesus christ came in the flesh
9339590 to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus
9339591 if any mans work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire
9339592 if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us
9339593 hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us
9339594 if god loves everybody then what significance is there to being loved
9339595 i used to love my husband but he drove it out of me
9339596 as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated
9339597 and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these
9339598 he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil
9339599 for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful and hating one another
9339600 the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet
9339601 i am the way and the truth and the life
9339602 this is my son whom i love listen to him
9339603 in my fathers house are many rooms if it were not so i would have told you i am going there to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where i am
9339604 this is the verdict light has come into the world but men loved darkness instead of light because there deeds were evil
9339605 i am with you to the very end of the age
9339606 it is not lawful for a layman to sit in judgment upon a clergyman secular judges who dare in the exercise of a damnable presumption are to be restrained by spiritual censures
9339607 the tribunals of kings are subjected to the power of priests
9339608 decreti pars i distinct x can vi you can believe that when the roman monster takes over the world all of this will rise again to its former monstrous glory how about this one
9339609 and all heretics of both sexes and of every name
9339610 it cannot be for you see it claims that it is infallible my friend
9339611 catholic religion used to teach that the sun goes around the earth and that the earth is not a globe but a plain
9339612 those are not to be accounted homicides who fired with zeal for mother church may have killed excommunicated persons
9339613 but you better believe that underlying the slick facade is heretic
9339614 pentecostalism is a modern american christian movement that emerged out of the holiness movement at the turn of the century
9339615 and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand
9339616 and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galilaeans and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born parthians and medes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judaea and cappadocia in pontus and asia phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god
9339617 yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue
9339618 how is it then brethren when ye come together every one of you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelation hath an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying
9339619 in which the spirit filled believer breaks out in uncontrollable laughter as a means of praise and worship to the lord while others dance uncontrollably around the church building even during the worship service
9339620 are you a christian or a jew or a hindu or what
9339621 small world me too protestant or catholic or greek orthodox
9339622 me too northern conservative fundamentalists baptist great lakes region or norther conservative fundamentalist baptist eastern region
9339623 me too norther conservative fundamentalist baptist great lakes region council of 1879 or northern conservative fundamentalist baptist great lakes region council of 1912
9339624 norther conservative fundamentalist baptist great lakes region council of 1912
9339625 and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau
9339626 and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother esaus hands so he blessed him
9339627 unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death
9339628 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven
9339629 and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day
9339630 full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition
9339631 what had peter said to prompt jesus to call him
9339632 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him
9339633 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
9339634 but exhort one another daily while it is called to day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin
9339635 yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution
9339636 and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau
9339637 notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you
9339638 and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits
9339639 the angel of the lord encampeth around about them that fear him and delivereth the
9339640 as it is written behold i lay in sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed
9339641 and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not that they might be saved
9339642 think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law
9339643 add unto the word which i command you neither shall ye diminish ought from it that ye may keep the commandments of the lord your god which i command you
9339644 the power to be saved is in jesus christ alone john 14 6 not the pope not the priest not a religion not the sacraments but only jesus acts 4 12
9339645 ye have wearied the lord with your words yet ye say wherein have we wearied him
9339646 how could god hate any man or woman whom he died upon the cross for
9339647 abortion and homosexuality are minor concerns in our church the bell we beat is that we must know jesus we are offering people a different and better way to live than secular america offers
9339648 and he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me
9339649 yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution
9339650 sean hannity has a dating website which welcomes homosexuals whos kidding who hannity and colmes are both unsaved heathens its time for americas christians to wake up and return to the god of the bible compromised morality under the pretense of love
9339651 i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan
9339652 the jews had sinned and god was angry at them
9339653 what better location could there be for an institution single mindedly dedicated to reaching and teaching jews their heritage
9339654 so they can teach millions of jews why they shouldnt believe in jesus
9339655 teaching jews their heritage dont you realize that their heritage is corrupted the heritage which
9339656 salvation may be of the jews but 95 of jews today dont have it this is the tragic truth how could jews today still reject their own savior read it for yourself on the biggest judaism website in the world
9339657 carefully notice that jesus spoke this to nicodemus a jew who was a religious leader over the jews every lost sinner must be born again if they want to go to heaven 2nd thessalonians 1 8 applies to everyone islamic muslims had nothing to do with 9 11
9339658 be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
9339659 remember also the although the jews wanted him punished for blasphemy and heresy it was the romans who wanted him dead for encouraging insurrection and revolution as they say it they were the ruling power and the only authority empowered to execute criminals under roman law
9339660 once again we find blogs like yours insisting that everyone else is wrong and only you and your cult are right in most cases its called paranoia
9339661 btw to the jews satan is only one of the angelic forces he was never evil in the xtian sense so to say that they are satanic is meaningless
9339662 personally considering this anti semitic raving id say youre encouraging behaviour just as bad as other superstitions
9339663 the common theory is that it is formed from ilah the common word for a god and the article al thus al ilah the god
9339664 but history establishes beyond the shadow of doubt that even the pagan arabs before muhammads time knew their chief god by the name of allah and even in a sense proclaimed his unity among the pagan arabs this term denoted the chief god of their pantheon the kaaba with its three hundred and sixty idols
9339665 historians like vaqqidi have said allah was actually the chief of the 360 gods one for each day of the year being worshiped in arabia at the time muhammad rose to prominence ibn al kalbi gave 27 names of pre islamic deities interestingly not many muslims want to accept that allah was already being worshiped at the kaba in mecca by arab pagans before muhammad came some muslims become angry when they are confronted with this fact but history is not on their side pre islamic literature has proved this
9339666 arabia in muhammads time was polytheistic in its conception of the cosmos and tribal in its social structure each tribe had its own god s and goddess es which were manifest in the forms of idols stones trees or stars in the sky
9339667 before islam the religions of the arabic world involved the worship of many spirits called jinn allah was but one of many gods worshiped in mecca but then muhammad taught the worship of allah as the only god whom he identified as the same god worshiped by christians and jews
9339668 historians like vaqqidi have said allah was actually the chief of the 360 gods one for each day of the year being worshiped in arabia at the time muhammad rose to prominence ibn al kalbi gave 27 names of pre islamic deities interestingly not many muslims want to accept that allah was already being worshiped at the kaba in mecca by arab pagans before muhammad came some muslims become angry when they are confronted with this fact but history is not on their side pre islamic literature has proved this
9339669 so what makes you think xtianity is the correct one
9339670 jesus answered thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice
9339671 now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate saying sir we remember that that
9339672 matthew 18 6 this scripture is referring to all of gods children god will avenge his children youd better think twice before you hurt gods own n otice that two thirds of the gospel is bad news good news
9339673 to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose the bible does not say all things are good it is a sad thing when a loved one dies but we know that god is still on his throne and in control why
9339674 you cant have light without dark or joy without misery or work without sleep good news
9339675 and the bible says he was also one of jesus disciples no mention is ever made of this man until the time of christs burial
9339676 that they should repent and turn to god and do works becoming or befitting for repentance
9339677 in other words works are the evidence of saving faith not a means to salvation the
9339678 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service
9339679 shew me thy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by my works
9339680 in acts 26 20 are not two separate events but one and the same proponents of the
9339681 now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty
9339682 i e a turning from the guilt and realized condemnation which sin brings
9339683 to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith
9339684 is not even found in the gospel book of john
9339685 to repent literally means to have a change of mind or spirit toward god and toward sin it means to turn from your sins earnestly with all your heart and trust in jesus christ to save you you can see then how the man who believes in christ repents and the man who repents believes in christ the jailer repented when he turned from sin to believe in the lord jesus christ
9339686 which brother rice speaks of is only in the sense of a realization of ones guilt not actually ceasing from committing sin
9339687 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness
9339688 it most certainly is not the same works that the catholic church teaches
9339689 because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it
9339690 worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly
9339691 there is no such thing as a carnal christian time 21 40 in video the bible never teaches that a person can be a genuine christian and live in continuous carnality and wickedness and sin all the days of their life
9339692 notice the rock n roll drums in the background what about the evils of christian rock mr washer and why did the sbc lift their ban against walt disney god hasnt lifted his ban whos the hypocrite
9339693 to go into a strip club and forgo conforming to our lord
9339694 and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner
9339695 your site is full of politics relating mildly to christianity and a limited amount of articles about saving grace
9339696 secondly the lord jesus christ says in john 8 11 to the adulterer to sin
9339697 and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner
9339698 you say a lot about righteousness yet you dont even have any sense in defending the holiness in the church
9339699 sixthly about the fruits of my salvation well i do not dare to say i have many fruits but i confidently say that i have some do you know what is the first thing that all apostles of jesus christ did when the holy spirit came into them they went soul winning i did preach to unbelievers passed out gospel tracts and now making this blog to call people to christ i dont cover myself in the self righteousness blanket and do nothing to help unbelievers
9339700 also you need to read the bible for what it says not for what you like it to say
9339701 hi i have a little prayer can you repeat after me so that you will be saved
9339702 you are carnal you are not a christian at all
9339703 not to be like britney spears not to be like the world
9339704 not to be like satanic christian rockers not to be like demonic christian rapers
9339705 what you need to know is that salvation is by faith and faith alone in jesus christ and faith alone in jesus christ is preceded and followed by repentance a turning away from sin a hatred for the things that god hates and a love for the things that god loves a growing in holiness and a desire not to be like britney spears not to be the like world and not to be like the great majority of american christians but to be like jesus christ
9339706 salvation is a free gift it is by grace through faith and faith alone
9339707 i will give you this gift freely but you must keep your yard clean if you dont i will come and take the gift back
9339708 so you honestly believe that someone can come to christ be born again and continue to practice sin
9339709 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out
9339710 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee
9339711 neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us
9339712 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son jesus that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9339713 sirs what must i do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved
9339714 but to him that worketh not but believeth on him jesus that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness
9339715 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
9339716 i do not set aside grace for if righteousness could be obtained through the law christ died for nothing
9339717 those dangerous perversions always start with faith in jesus something else which results in no faith in jesus at all
9339718 so would it be fair to say that whether or not we personally
9339719 did you mean that i am adding faith in jesus plus something else and if so what have i added
9339720 i am glad that you are heading on the right direction by acknowledging salvation is by grace through faith in jesus christ alone
9339721 so would it be fair to say that whether or not we personally
9339722 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him
9339723 even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works
9339724 and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead
9339725 love god with all my heart either or to submit to him in my heart or to hate sin with all my heart and desire to turn away from it
9339726 what must i do to be doing the works of god
9339727 a person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven
9339728 work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is god who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure
9339729 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
9339730 but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness
9339731 yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works shew me thy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by my works
9339732 and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely
9339733 i believe but grace is the foundation of my faith
9339734 so too at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace
9339735 but if it is by grace it is no longer on the basis of works otherwise grace would no longer be grace
9339736 and i was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of god
9339737 the foundation of our faith is gods grace not what we decide choose to
9339738 but if it is by grace it is no longer on the basis of works otherwise grace would no longer be grace
9339739 thus saith the lord where is the bill of your mothers divorcement whom i have put away or which of my creditors is it to whom i have sold you behold for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves and for your transgressions is your mother put away
9339740 i say then hath god cast away his people god forbid for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew wot ye not what the scripture saith of elias how he maketh intercession to god against israel saying lord they have killed thy prophets and digged down thine altars and i am left alone and they seek my life but what saith the answer of god unto him i have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of baal even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace
9339741 and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more
9339742 why did jesus tell the adulterer to sin no more why did he command this after she got saved
9339743 do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law
9339744 why did jesus even say this if he knew salvation could not be lost
9339745 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out
9339746 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee
9339747 ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory
9339748 if i cannot lose my salvation as you claim can i lead others to hell with a false doctrine after i believe in jesus and still go to heaven can i accidentally blaspheme against the holy spirit would i be forgiven
9339749 come now and let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool
9339750 wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men
9339751 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his
9339752 and when he the holy spirit is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment
9339753 thus you cannot speak evil of jesus without also speaking evil of god the father and the holy spirit
9339754 if we do acknowledge what jesus christ has done for us died on a cross shedding blood and receive him into our heart
9339755 seest thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect
9339756 and we are born again of our spirit not of flesh and we still keep sinning what paul wanted to get at once again is that if youre born again youre walking with the lord and youll falter here and there but your core heart is in jesus christ constantly correcting yourself for jesus christ
9339757 a turning away from sin a hatred for the things that god hates and a love for the things that god loves a growing in holiness and a desire
9339758 but he who endures to the end shall be saved
9339759 for false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive if possible even the elect see i have told you beforehand
9339760 but if that servant says in his heart my master is delaying his coming and begins to beat the male and female servants and to eat and drink and be drunk the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not looking for him and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers
9339761 a sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was trampled down and the birds of the air devoured it some fell on rock and as soon as it sprang up it withered away because it lacked moisture and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it but others fell on good ground sprang up and yielded a crop a hundredfold
9339762 now the parable is this the seed is the word of god
9339763 now the ones that fell among thorns are those who when they have heard go out and they are choked with cares riches and pleasures of life and bring no fruit to maturity
9339764 but the ones that fell on the good ground are those who having heard the word with a noble and good heart keep it note the word for keep means hold fast keep stay in regards to from going away this is our personal responsibility to continue to believe the word of god and to stay faithful to him and bear fruit with patience
9339765 salt is good but if the salt has lost its flavor how shall it be seasoned it is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill but men throw it out he who has ears to hear let him hear
9339766 and not many days after the younger son gathered all together journeyed to a far country and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living
9339767 and the son said to him father i have sinned against heaven and in your sight and am no longer worthy to be called your son
9339768 for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be merry
9339769 simon simon peter indeed satan has asked for you that he may sift you as wheat note the word for sift means by inward agitation to try ones faith to the verge of overthrow you see satan can try to get you to overthrow your faith but i have prayed for you that your faith should not fail note i see the lord implying that it is possible that our faith could fail if that were to happen then we would no longer have the condition to receive grace and our relationship with god would cease and when you have returned to me note the word for returned means turn again turn back come back in regards to the love and obedience of god thats pretty simple to understand it is possible to stop obeying god then we would need to turn back to him strengthen your brethren
9339770 i am the true vine and my father is the vinedresser
9339771 if anyone does not abide in me he is cast out as a branch and is withered note in order to be cast out one must first be in christ and they gather them and throw them into the fire and they are burned
9339772 branches were broken off that i might be grafted in
9339773 the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play
9339774 let everyone who names the name of christ the lord depart from iniquity
9339775 now the just shall live by faith but if anyone draws back my soul has no pleasure in him
9339776 they allure through the lusts of the flesh through lewdness the ones who have actually escaped from them who live in error
9339777 they themselves are slaves of corruption for by whom a person is overcome by him also he brought into bondage
9339778 remember therefore from where you have fallen repent and do the first works or else i will come to you quickly and remove your lampstand from its place unless you repent he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches to him who overcomes i will give to eat from the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god
9339779 do not fear any of those things which you are about to suffer indeed the devil is about to throw some of you into prison that you may be tested be faithful until death and i will give you the crown of life he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches he who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death
9339780 so then because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold i will vomit you out of my mouth
9339781 he who believes in the son has everlasting life and he who does not believe the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abides on him
9339782 the lord is my helper i will not fear what can man do to me
9339783 behold you will rest with your fathers and this people will rise and play the harlot with the gods of the foreigners of the land where they go to be among them and they will forsake me and break my covenant which i have made with them then my anger shall be aroused against them in that day and i will forsake them and i will hide my face from them and they shall be devoured
9339784 i am the bread of life he who comes to me shall never hunger and he who believes in me shall never thirst but i said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe all that the father gives me will come to me and the one who comes to me i will by no means cast out
9339785 all that the father gives me will come to me
9339786 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall anyone snatch them out of my hand my father who has given them to me is greater than all and no one is able to snatch them out of my fathers hand i and my father are one
9339787 i am the light of the world he who follows me shall not walk in darkness but have the light of life
9339788 and i will pray the father and he will give you another helper that he may abide with you forever
9339789 teaching them to observe all things that i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even to the end of the age
9339790 i keep myself surrendered to god because i am his slave
9339791 will i still love god even if he throws me into hell
9339792 some people dont know what the word for believe means one of the things it means is be committed unto
9339793 but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved
9339794 but and if that servant say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens and to eat and drink and to be drunken the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him in sunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers
9339795 and that servant which knew his lords will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes
9339796 salt is good but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be seasoned it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dunghill but men cast it out he that hath ears to hear let him hear
9339797 and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple
9339798 so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple
9339799 and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that i have is thine
9339800 but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren
9339801 that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren
9339802 study to show thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth
9339803 for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
9339804 lord i realize that im a sinner i am on my way to hell mankinds relationship with you is severed because of sin will you please forgive me and take away my sin and help me to build a relationship with you will you cleanse my unrighteousness and forgive my sins and save me from them thank you for promising that you will when we confess it
9339805 i dont want to be unkind but the first thing i want to tell you is that you are doctrinally corrupted the main reason for that corruption is because of your assumption that salvation is some kinds of a process a lifestyle
9339806 i am sorry if you feel i have been wasting your time
9339807 i believe that the sole reason why jesus came was not so save mankind from hell physically the sole reason he came was to repair the severed damaged relationship that exists between humankind and god so that man do not have to be forever apart from god hell if you will
9339808 the deadliest attack of the devil is a half truth
9339809 satan comes to us with temptation just like he came to eve the moment we sin the sickness returns we dont immediately die but if we continue in that sin we will the moment we choose the sin we damage our relationship with god we do something he hates but because we love him we return to him and ask for forgiveness and he forgives us and he cleanses us and he restores the relationship and thus we grow and become stronger against the temptations of sin we still sometimes fall but we always come back and ask for forgiveness and everytime he forgives and forgets about our sins we thus live in a relationship with him that is what paul and peter and john meant by continuing in the faith biblical faith is a relationship its about love between god and us
9339810 if we fail in that sanctification process will god throw us back to the trash can to be burned
9339811 we have been arguing about whether it is possible to lose your salvation
9339812 oh i continue on my faith it is because of that continuity in faith that make me eternally secured
9339813 i believe in god two years ago but now i stop believing
9339814 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth for ever
9339815 for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have fallen turned away from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows
9339816 now the just shall live by faith but if anyone draws back my soul has no pleasure in him
9339817 if any of you fall turn away from the truth
9339818 true born again christians are regenerated amp sanctified by holy spirit throughout their lives
9339819 now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling desiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm
9339820 from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling desiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm
9339821 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
9339822 not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil
9339823 having damnation because they have cast off their first faith
9339824 let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old having been the wife of one man well reported of for good works if she have brought up children if she have lodged strangers if she have washed the saints feet if she have relieved the afflicted if she have diligently followed every good work
9339825 but the younger widows refuse for when they have begun to wax wanton against christ they will marry having damnation because they have cast off their first faith
9339826 for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows
9339827 and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection
9339828 who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection is past already and overthrow the faith of some
9339829 how will we escape that same punishment i e hell if we neglect i e reject so great salvation
9339830 who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace
9339831 for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him
9339832 but we who real christians are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul
9339833 brethren if any of you do err from the truth and one convert him let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins
9339834 brethren if any of you do err from the truth and one convert him
9339835 ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you
9339836 for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god
9339837 you cant say that what people cannot see isnt works but faith what about your thoughts jesus said in matt 5 that whoever looks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart that is also a work even though you did not use any part of your body you will say you use your mind well you say to believe you use your heart
9339838 my theology teaches that eternal security is not my work putting faith in jesus christ but jesus christ himself by being in a relationship with him true biblical faith
9339839 say you got saved born again regenerated even sanctified as heb 10 26 29 says but you reject your relationship faith in jesus christ accodring to your teaching this is impossible because god forces you to be saved in this case you have no free will after being saved but the above scriptures clearly shows otherwis i e that one can turn from the faith it doesnt mean you stop believing in god or jesus head knowledge it means you reject the salvation he freely gave and god does not force anyone to be saved we have to choose him
9339840 wake up america you are not like the rest of the world that have been practicing christianity in an unchanged way
9339841 he preaches a hard message that needs to be heard
9339842 wake up america you are not like the rest of the world that have been practicing christianity in an unchanged way
9339843 we see dangerous preaching about importance of earthly prosperity pastors litterly hitting people into healing pastors denying christ as the only way some christians making way for nwo of jesus christ very scary we rub shoulders with followers of these preaching every day and yet we are talking about paul washer get with the program people
9339844 i think we need to cry out to jesus to show us the truth
9339845 if you are uncomfortable because you need to give up things you know does not please god then i think washer has done his job and god is growing the seed in your heart
9339846 paul preaches when you have truly given yourself over to the lord you are truly christian your desire will be to obey him love him and practice show the fruits of the gift of salvation jesus commanded us to turn away from our wicked ways
9339847 come on people paul washer or any other preacher on the face of this earth is called a heretic by someone yet someone out there is preaching the truth are you sure you got it right are you going to bet eternity on your doctrine look to the bible narrow is the path
9339848 elevating a man to the position out of examination is called idolatry
9339849 no that is not what he teaches people he clearly says that believers who do not show fruits of their salvation are unsaved that is unbiblical and very dangerous his teachings indicate that you must do some works to be sure that you are truly saved salvation is a free gift from god apart from all good works or self righteousness
9339850 the ax is already at the root of the trees and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire
9339851 43 therefore i tell you that the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit
9339852 because you love jesus you will want to turn from sin because of the holy spirit
9339853 his teachings indicate that you must do some works to be sure that you are truly saved
9339854 that happens the moment you have your simple childlike faith in jesus christ as your personal saviour
9339855 no no daddy santa is real i know he is real
9339856 yes that is what i recommend you to do read the bible when you read the bible no false teacher can deceive you and you can understand fundamental teachings of christianity correctly
9339857 when you read the bible no false teacher can deceive you
9339858 and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched
9339859 there was nothing they could do to be saved and nothing they could do to lose it
9339860 therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents but forasmuch as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying lord have patience with me and i will pay thee all then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt but the same servant went out and found one of his fellowservants which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest and his fellowservant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee all and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt so when his fellowservants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant even as i had pity on thee and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses
9339861 why would christ ever threaten the elect will hell if going there was an absolute inalterable impossibility for them
9339862 if they do not persevere they were never christs to begin with
9339863 i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned
9339864 and concerning your interpretation of john 15 you say the fruit are souls
9339865 god tested abrahams faith gen 22 1 12 osas would make it impossible to fail the test of faith test of faith is thus unnecessary for you either believe or you dont according to osas
9339866 confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god
9339867 take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god but exhort one another daily while it is called to day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin
9339868 no paul is talking about a believer here he does not say that in his words but i somehow get it from the verse
9339869 for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive
9339870 the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world
9339871 they did believe otherwise you say christ is a lier but fell away i e they are on their way to hell
9339872 men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this day
9339873 concerning 1 tim 3 6 the condemnation of the devil is hell not the judgement seat of christ the ones mentioned in this verse is indanger of hell not the judgement seat of christ
9339874 accodring to your false demonic doctrine satan the fallen angels muhammed and every single sinner is saved for i quote youre own teaching
9339875 if you didnt have to do anything to receive salvation then that means you dont have to do anything not even believe
9339876 mat 10 22 and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved

9339884 these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god
9339885 give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you
9339886 do you honestly believe that a truly born again christians will not want to turn from sins and try to live a righteous life
9339887 they heard the gospel they know who god is they repeated the prayer in book of romans and they claim that they are

9339891 one of the biggest problem with paul washer is that he elevates the position of believers to a point beyond the position of sinners

9339894 15do not love the world or anything in the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him 16for everything in the world the cravings of sinful man the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does comes not from the father but from the world 17the world and its desires pass away but the man who does the will of god lives forever
9339895 4everyone who sins breaks the law in fact sin is lawlessness 5but you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins and in him is no sin 6no one who lives in him keeps on sinning no one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him
9339896 20then jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed because they did not repent
9339897 i tell you no but unless you repent you too will all perish
9339898 if your brother sins rebuke him and if he repents forgive him
9339899 7i tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety nine righteous persons who do not need to repent
9339900 47and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations beginning at jerusalem
9339901 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit
9339902 so then god has granted even the gentiles repentance unto life
9339903 godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret but worldly sorrow brings death
9339904 20first to those in damascus then to those in jerusalem and in all judea and to the gentiles also i preached that they should repent and turn to god and prove their repentance by their deeds
9339905 perhaps in 1 john or the whole bible for that matter are so that you believe in the name
9339906 there are blue prints to build a house i believe that they will work and i will have such a beautiful house and it will be safe but if i dont pick up my hammer and nails and prove my belief that those plans are good by building the house it will not get built and nor can i say i have faith in them
9339907 there is no carnal christian none if you seek the world there shall you be if you seek sin if you continue to participate in habitual sin you will die its as simple as that
9339908 and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ
9339909 if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us
9339910 and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever
9339911 and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day
9339912 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9339913 whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him
9339914 greek metanoeo meaning to change ones mind and purpose as the result of after knowledge this verb with the cognate noun metanoia is used of true repentance a change of mind and purpose and life to which remission of sin is promised
9339915 a persistent endeavour after a holy life in a walking with god in the way of his commandments
9339916 you say that gods will is john 6 40 but that is not the only part of gods will
9339917 furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the lord jesus that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please god so ye would abound more and more
9339918 i guess when jesus said only those that do the will of god will be saved he meant all the will of god
9339919 and no it is not thru our own strength we do the will of god for we cannot but he works in us to will and to work
9339920 for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not as a result of works that no one should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus for good works which god prepared beforehand that we should walk in them
9339921 what shall we do that we may work the works of god
9339922 this is the work of god that you believe in him whom he has sent
9339923 hey i cannot talk to you as disciples of christ but as carnal people even as babes in christ
9339924 there are no such thing as a carnal christian if a christian becomes carnal he will die in his sins like the prodigal son and be lost unless he return to god and be revived oh sorry let me rephrase that a carnal christian is a dead in his sins christian i e not a christian anymore but a lost sinner again going to hell unless he repents
9339925 yes christians do sin but those who continually put their faith upon jesus i e true biblical faith will not live in a continualy state of carnality
9339926 the context of these verses clearly state that abrahams faith was a living relationship with god a obedient doing the whole will of god relationship which was shown by his actions yes his works and only after he had that true biblical faith obedient relationship with god was christs righteousness imputed unto him
9339927 what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered
9339928 you think we work because we want to be saved no my friend we work because we are saved and being saved
9339929 repentance is turning away from sin not just a change of mind sin begins in the mind if you change your mind about something you will not do it it will not give birth to sin
9339930 god is holy he hates sin and he hates the unrighteous and those that love violence ps 11 5
9339931 osas gives a license to sin no matter how you try to dress it up

9339933 8the one who sows to please his sinful nature from that nature a will reap destruction the one who sows to please the spirit from the spirit will reap eternal life
9339934 it makes me think that you just want to climb up over christ and step on his head to grasp at the sin that once loomed above him like a giant disgusting plague of iniquity you will follow it directly to hell
9339935 there is no carnal christian if you act in carnalness then you are not acting like a christian
9339936 and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted
9339937 woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts
9339938 you follow the general american brainwashed population think about that one not saying that at some point there will be a wakeup call to the truth but narrow is the path and door and few will find it there is too many different views of christianity to say that every denomination
9339939 we are better right now than at the beginning for we have both our righteousness and the belief in god no doubt we are better than many others
9339940 but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ

9339942 but what if he disowns you what if he rejects you yes he is still technically your son but he rejects you dinowns you and stops to have fellowship with you
9339943 without fellowship there is no relationship without relationship there is no sonship yes you are a son but then youre a dead son a lost son that will burn in hell son which is sad but true adam was gods son but sin caused him to lose his fellowship his relationship with god death was his punishment
9339944 and the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he looketh upon it shall live
9339945 look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else

9339950 1 you either believe at the beginning or you do not believe at all in other words genuine faith cannot be stopped true believers may neglect their faith but they will never stop or abolish their faith

9339952 3 salvation is the difference between heaven and hell i e saved or lost discipleship is the difference between believers and fruitful christians
9339953 i used to know you in the past but now i dont know you anymore
9339954 the idea that believers can lose stop or abolish their faith is not rooted in the bible but is a humans thinking a philosophy not taught in the bible
