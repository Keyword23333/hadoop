8500000 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
8500001 i do think that what the argument may miss is the sense of control that we want individuals to have in determining their own career paths making their own life choices and so forth and i also think you want to instill that sense of self reliance and that what you do will help determine outcomes
8500002 now thats the story now telling it elegantly low taxes smaller government the way the republicans have i think is more of a challenge
8500003 god willing and with the goodwill of the parties and the tireless work of the parties we have a good chance to succeed
8500004 if this had been easy somebody would have solved it a long time ago
8500005 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time
8500006 in todays competitive market ga asi has been successful in attracting and retaining highly talented and dynamic professionals whose impressive and continuing innovations have expanded the capabilities and criticality of predator series unmanned aircraft to the security of the u s and our allies
8500007 this industry wide ranking by aviation week reflects an inspired workforce whose contributions are recognized valued and have an immediate impact in producing unmanned aircraft that support forces on the front line around the globe no question they are best in class and most deserving of this distinction
8500008 ga asi has consistently been a player in this list for the technological challenge it offers its employees 2006 and now for valuing the individual
8500009 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8500010 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8500011 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8500012 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8500013 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8500014 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8500015 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8500016 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8500017 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8500018 while i regret my three years of incarceration i have no bitterness and now understand how it could happen
8500019 most valuable and economical defector this agency has ever had
8500020 we have not found willing partners on the other side of the table
8500021 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
8500022 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost
8500023 i paid the bills whether i ate or didnt whether i went to the doctor or not
8500024 id go to bed and all i had on my mind was bankruptcy
8500025 you have to cry and try and figure out what in the world could i do
8500026 they accept her as one of the guys they accept her because she can play the game
8500027 i just wanted to get a base hit because i knew the next guy behind me could pick up where i left off
8500028 i knew i had to prove myself if i wanted to play baseball but i love to practice i love my team and my coaches are incredible so its easy for me to try harder
8500029 i always told her that all she had to do was put in the effort
8500030 but i never really had to stress that with her she always just did it she works harder than most of the boys because she just wants to be treated like a ballplayer
8500031 even then she was already showing what a good ballplayer she could be
8500032 shes made everyone look past the fact that shes a girl
8500033 in our league we just want to put the best kids on the field and shes one of the best
8500034 the way she turns that double play at second base you can tell shes put in a lot of practice
8500035 when a ground ball is coming at her shes always right in front of it with both hands down shes always in the right position if its hit in her direction we just assume its an out and were already walking off the field
8500036 although my dad started calling me that first and it got me angry and i told my teammates about it and they started calling me it too that made me want to actually hit a home run just to show i could do it
8500037 ive had five home runs and theyve all been in tournament games
8500038 ive never hit one in the regular season im the only one on my team that didnt hit one during the season
8500039 my teammates call me helga or beast but theyre really good to me
8500040 ive seen the softball games i know a lot of the girls
8500041 but i know the competition in baseball is whats made me try harder the more i have to prove myself the harder ill work
8500042 theres no doubt in my mind she can succeed at pony and i think she can play high school ball and beyond
8500043 she wants to play so badly she puts the time in she puts the work in and the desire is there she can play on any team anytime shes earned her place
8500044 it looked like she had been reaching for them at some point
8500045 i guess when youre watching the sun rise and set you think about things like that
8500046 i love them so much they did the best job they didnt give up
8500047 when they loaded her in the ambulance and the sirens began there was a loud roar of applause that drowned out the siren
8500048 there was prayer lifted up for her all over this county in all the churches
8500049 this years theme is your town at work we are interested in what people did for work in the past in town and what they are doing today
8500050 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8500051 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8500052 we dont need anything of this magnitude to come here
8500053 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8500054 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8500055 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf
8500056 he was ahead of his time and he did everything himself
8500057 abie nathan loved life loved mankind and loved peace he painted israeli society with a unique shade of humanism and compassion
8500058 the peace ship is a project of the people we hope through this station we will help relieve the pain and heal the wounds of many years of suffering of the people of the middle east
8500059 jackson hattiesburg laurel and all areas along the coast its a little mexico
8500060 im not against people trying to make living i have a compassion for those folks but at the same time the taxpayers of mississippi shouldnt be subsidizing a plant that wont even hire their own workers
8500061 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8500062 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
8500063 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
8500064 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
8500065 that doesnt justify but it certainly explains why they might be hiring individuals who show up and say ill work for you
8500066 we would have an immigration policy that brings 12 million people out of the shadows
8500067 we all know our countrys journey toward equality isnt finished yet we have more work to do
8500068 hes our story he has walked in our shoes and he has walked our mile
8500069 the reality is the accident is just the beginning of the story a story that has no end as it impacts our lives forever
8500070 the drunk driver who hit us not only killed our daughter holly but he changed my wife and i as people forever
8500071 a drunk driver being in jail doesnt help us to heal
8500072 although our story is very difficult to talk about i think it is a powerful one
8500073 i think we can make a difference if we share it i think it was important for us to be here today
8500074 i highly recommend this team they over deliver on all of their projects
8500075 well keep everyone abreast of continued new nfl betting product releases
8500076 using simple nfl betting methods we can look for the silver lining and profit margin in our work
8500077 but what really incensed me was when i was told i could not change it back to lloyds is pants because they said it was not appropriate
8500078 i asked if it was pants they didnt like and would lloyds is rubbish do but they didnt think so
8500079 so i tried barclays is better and that didnt go down too well either
8500080 the rules seemed to change and they told me it had to be one word so i tried censorship but they didnt like that and then said it had to be no more than six letters long
8500081 it is very disappointing that he felt the need to express his upset with our service in this way customers can have any password they choose and it is not our policy to allow staff to change the password without the customers permission
8500082 the member of staff involved no longer works for lloyds tsb
8500083 did you wash my dishes you are not allowed to wash my dishes no
8500084 thank you that is the nicest thing you could have done for me just dont do it again
8500085 i am so obsessed with my mother as soon as i go to sleep i start dreaming and everyone in my dream turns into my mother i wake up in such a state and all i can do is go downstairs and eat a piece of toast
8500086 what just one piece of toast for a big boy like you
8500087 really the only thing you can choose here is the operating software so you can have a linux based product or windows based
8500088 thats pretty much the only configuration you can choose as opposed to the u s where you can configure everything you want
8500089 linux is highly used in emerging markets and widely accepted
8500090 it allows us to offer a more basic computing and affordable computing platform
8500091 they really were made with the emerging markets in mind and the needs of these small businesses
8500092 the products revolve around those needs affordability access to technology only the software they want basic computing needs
8500093 theres no question that some of our largest tech companies who have been so successful as global competitors are finding that there are new competitors from emerging markets and from even more advanced economies
8500094 the way for them to remain competitive and to keep growing is through designing products that reach out to consumers in emerging markets who have the purchasing power and now the desire to connect to the global economy through the internet and through technology
8500095 the key i think is designing products with the proper price points for consumers in emerging markets so its not a question only of innovation but a question of design and efficiency to reach those hundreds of millions of potential consumers

8500097 as a clinic for lesbians who lacked access to nonjudgmental affordable health care named after phyllis lyon and del martin the clinic soon became a model for culturally sensitive community based health care since 1993 lyon martin also has provided case management and primary healthcare in programs specifically designed for very low income and uninsured women with hiv in 2007 the organization added sliding scale mental health services
8500098 there is no ban on shipment of sirfs or our customers products in fact the itc will not even make any final determination until december after they have finished their investigation including reviewing the itc staffs appeal and our appeal
8500099 meanwhile we continue to provide our customers with products and services to address their needs and ensure that consumers get the full benefits of sirfs innovations

8500123 just let me live til voting time in november in my lifetime we just might get to see the first african american president
8500124 from the automatic weapons used it looks like the handiwork of maoists
8500125 whatever evidence we have got is consistent with the maoist stamp in the kind of operation they undertake the assailants had left a note written on the letterhead of vamsadhara zonal committee signed by one azad and it is consistent with the maoist methods
8500126 we have interrogated people but had to let them go after finding little evidence
8500127 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment but even kate moss doesnt live up to the image
8500128 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
8500129 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
8500130 i get comfort from carrying my rosary going to mass every sunday its my time alone
8500131 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
8500132 a person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae
8500133 there are those who say that catholics should be robots theres a formula
8500134 if i were an ordained priest id be taking some issue with some of the more narrow interpretations of the gospel being taken now
8500135 but my church is more than 2 000 years old theres always been a tug of war among prelates and informed lay members

8500144 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8500145 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8500146 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8500147 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8500148 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8500149 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8500150 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8500151 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8500152 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8500153 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8500154 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
8500155 it took decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop the drug
8500156 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8500157 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8500158 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business in iraq but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else then thats where we need to be
8500159 it will be a mystery run so i cant say where it will go but it will take an hour and a half and there will be a pig roast and raffle at the end
8500160 we redid the front playground a few years ago and now we would like to put in a new playground for the younger kids in back because the equipment is rather old
8500161 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8500162 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8500163 military ships are hardly a common way to deliver such aid
8500164 can nato which is not a state located in the black sea continuously increase its group of forces and systems there it turns out that it cannot
8500165 computers used to take up entire buildings now they just take up our entire lives
8500166 so how do you know what is the right path to choose to get the result that you desire and the honest answer is this you wont and accepting that greatly eases the anxiety of your life experience
8500167 we need to do things to make people want to come here and theres no doubt adding new exciting attractions accomplishes that goal i think people are really going to be amazed how beautiful and visually stimulating the casino of the wind is

8500222 he has within him i think the qualifications to do it
8500223 truly helps mccain in his weakest area and that is the economy
8500224 the biggest problem obama has today is whether or not he can pull in the hillary clinton vote
8500225 you can swim all day in the sea of knowledge and never get wet
8500226 how do you stop the angry person without enough sense
8500227 its not going to take very long for it to be a total massacre
8500228 which risk is more likely that someone is going to accidentally set off a gun in class and god forbid hit a student or someone will come in off the highway and start a random shooting spree
8500229 just so you know i never want to live in a vegetative state dependent on some machine and fluids from a bottle if that ever happens just pull the plug
8500230 our state is better prepared than it has been before to respond to a

8500237 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8500238 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8500242 mark was a rookie in 1998 when the team lost 108 games i was a rookie in 1999 and we lost 98
8500243 we sort of grew up together in the game during a period in which we were losing but knew we were building a special team under dave dombrowskis leadership i was learning how to be an owner he was learning how to hit major league pitching
8500244 hal steinbrenner had said to me once when he and i were walking into a championship clubhouse us going in here is sort of like in high school where the teachers come walking through i told mark that i didnt want to intrude or invade their space he was adamant that my presence was a positive not a negative
8500245 in those days i took the loss of any player very hard
8500246 one of my toughest days was getting traded from the marlins
8500247 i had built a great relationship with john probably more of a personal relationship than most players do it was a sad day to go but at the same time todays a great day to come back and be reunited
8500248 ive always wanted to be a part of this series and have red sox across my jersey take the mound in a big series and get to pitch its just a blast like a playoff game
8500249 ill give you two specific examples actually paul byrd and mark kotsay
8500250 there are a lot of teams out there that might need certain things and its like well suck it up and deal with it i dont mean any of that as a slight but the attitude of winning here is so great that if theres something those guys in the front office can do to help us they go out and do it that speaks volumes throughout the organization
8500251 shonda and i cant express our gratitude enough to the thousands of people that contributed to this incredibly important campaign every single dollar raised brings us one step closer to finding a cure for als
8500252 i served real well and thats going to be key at this tournament
8500253 its ok its going to be good in two days im sure

8500261 while the outlook remains pretty overcast for the aviation industry the winners will be those airlines that focus on offering the best customer service and which are nimble enough to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead our strategy of slowing our growth has paid off in time for the slowdown in the industry against the backdrop of high oil prices and weakening consumer demand we are well placed to succeed over the coming months we have diversified our route network focused on providing the best product in upper class premium economy and economy hedged our fuel purchasing and built up a strong cash position
8500262 it was clear to us that our customers were demanding a level of reliability functionality and growth potential that was only achievable with pmad class 3 equipment
8500263 we have several customers that are installing gen x under the faa class 2 requirements as well they too will enjoy the benefits of a pmad class 3 device with the added flexibility of a removable installation this offers our customers the best of both worlds
8500264 airlines will benefit from a more clear path to operational approval with a pmad class 3 device the class 3 pmad solution relieves much of the burden otherwise placed on airlines and their principal inspectors for class 2 cots devices carrying no certifications
8500265 the possibilities suggested by unmanned flight are truly exciting and with these trials zephyr has secured its place in the history of uav development both flights were achieved in the face of thunderstorms and debilitating heat in the hostile environment of the new mexico high desert in the summertime they have proved that an autonomous uav can be operated on solar electric power for the duration required to support persistent military operations

8500271 we have banned tehreek e taliban pakistan because of their involvement in a series of suicide attacks
8500272 they themselves have claimed responsibility of several suicide attacks and the government cannot engage in a dialogue with such people
8500273 for besieging the afghan and foreign forces in kabul we have begun the initial work on the main roads leading to kabul from four directions
8500274 we dont have a system here the government does not have a solution
8500275 if we did not have foreigners here i dont think the afghan national army or police would come out of their bases
8500276 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8500277 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8500278 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8500279 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8500280 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8500281 we randomly purchased 193 traditional indian ayurvedic medicine products from the internet about 60 percent were from u s companies and 40 percent from indian companies twenty one percent had significant levels of lead mercury and arsenic

8500299 it says more importantly that the changes to business confidence and the slowdown in the first half of the year and concerns about the global credit crunch havent dented the positive story for australia he said
8500300 it will have people revising their gdp gross domestic product guesses for next week he said about the abs national accounts data due on september 3
8500301 it will be a cautious easing cycle the reserve bank embarks on he said
8500302 the mining industry is still pretty strong and very profitable just given the reports from bhp and rio just recently mr lee said
8500303 capital expenditure is likely to remain strong there for a while
8500304 capex in these sorts of industries would be pretty strong mr lee said
8500305 anyone who revised down their gdp forecast yesterday would probably be revising them back up to about the same level mr lee said
8500306 as the rba prepares to cut rates next tuesday for the first time in seven years todays data would have been welcomed she said
8500307 a return to full pre flood production levels at coppabella is not expected until january 2009 macarthur chief executive nicole hollows said in a statement
8500308 rani and lara came together as guests on the show they were very chirpy with each other but as soon as they walked on the stage to face salman the equation changed
8500309 it was evident that salman was more comfortable talking to rani than lara even his jokes and his one liners were directed towards her lara looked like she was out of place
8500310 this morning his lawyer said the girls mother and this guy were never married they had a civil ceremony but that was it
8500311 this morning his lawyer said the girls mother and this guy were never married they had a civil ceremony but that was it
8500312 barack obama and i took very different journeys to this destination but we share a common story
8500313 we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they just try hard enough that was americas promise for those of us who grew up in middle class neighborhoods like scranton and wilmington
8500314 these are common stories among middle class people whove worked hard their whole life played by the rules on the promise that their tomorrows would be better than their yesterdays that promise is the promise of america
8500315 it defines who we are as a people and now its in jeopardy i know it you know it but john mccain doesnt seem to get it barack obama gets it though
8500316 my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you everyone is your equal and everyone is equal to you
8500317 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8500318 now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong and barack obama was right
8500319 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abysmal failure
8500320 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8500321 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8500322 at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea change in america doesnt start from top down it starts from the bottom up that change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things
8500323 and so we want to open up this convention to make sure that everyone who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back i think we are going to have a great night tomorrow night and i look forward to seeing you there god bless you god bless america
8500324 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8500325 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the unites states
8500326 madame secretary i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the further conduct of the roll call vote
8500327 all votes cast by the delegates will be counted and that i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8500328 without a strong democratic majority in the senate his ambitious agenda will be thwarted by the defenders of the status quo whose goals can be boiled down to a single word no
8500329 i thought bill clinton hit a home run today and hillary hit one last night
8500330 bill clinton put his finger exactly on the heart of the matter when he came to office people said he had no experience with the national economy with international affairs and he succeeded beyond his wildest expectations i know barack obama i know bill clinton i worked with both men and i have extraordinary confidence in barack obamas ability
8500331 his speech was brilliant he really talked about the difference between mccain and barack obama
8500332 and he clearly showed why we should all support barack obama if there are any remaining hillary supporters who didnt feel they shouldnt be with barack i think thats all gone away both clintons have made it clear that he represents the future
8500333 i think that he has sound judgment and wisdom and a curious mind i think he knows what hes doing
8500334 hes ready to be commander in chief and hes got a great partner in joe biden so im very happy
8500335 its the first time that unanimous by proclamation by unanimous consent that we have an african american president
8500336 it just cant get better for america thats why were here
8500337 this is a great moment not just for our country but for the world because he is going to be the leader of the free world
8500338 but we need to recognize that thats the case we have to re double our efforts we take nothing for granted
8500339 this letter is to inform you that the existing signs located on the second floor of the above noted building have been removed both from the north and south elevations you have received photos which i delivered to you on april 14 1999 which further substantiate this
8500340 all of us owe george soros a great deal of gratitude
8500341 he thinks the ballot question is a responsible initiative to reduce the overreliance on criminal justice sanctions in dealing with marijuana
8500342 marijuana should not be a priority of the criminal justice system
8500343 decriminalizing marijuana is a slippery slope and sends the wrong message
8500344 compounding this is the fact that users of marijuana are 10 times more likely to be injured or injure others in automobile crashes
8500345 they can move on and get a student loan and get their first apartment and move on with their lives
8500346 people recognize that there are a lot better things we could be doing with our police resources
8500347 we may observe here that the liability of the members of unlawful assembly who knew that an offence was likely to be committed in prosecution of the object for which they had assembled is equal to those who commit it
8500348 it is a case where the members of one community were singled out and were murdered and their properties were burnt and looted such lawlessness deserved to be sternly dealt with
8500349 chaque seconde qui passe est une occasion de changer le cours de sa vie
8500350 and i guarantee that by the time you hit missoula theres gonna be snow
8500351 it goes against the public markets policy of the government which requires them to stimulate competition and look for local alternatives its really an absurdity
8500352 a strategic free software utilization in public administration could create thousands of jobs as well as a significant decrease in software licensing costs
8500353 however quebecs public administration refuses to even consider and evaluate these options
8500354 theres a general lack of awareness of the software sector by the people who are actually making individual acquisition decisions
8500355 the policies say everything is open but the practice becomes a little different
8500356 the proprietary software vendors have been very successful in convincing people in procurement whether in government or the private sector that software is a product and you buy it like you do an automobile
8500357 if you actually look at what software does its more like a service
8500358 it means that the third ddg 1000 ship is very likely to go forward and yet theres also the potential of building more ddg 51s
8500359 this plan will provide stability of the industrial base and continue the development of advanced surface ship technologies such as radar systems stealth magnetic and acoustic quieting and automated damage control
8500360 do not attempt to kill the baby in the uterus the goal is simply to prematurely deliver a baby who dies during the birth process or soon afterward
8500361 it is not uncommon for a live aborted baby to linger for an hour or two or even longer at christ hospital one lived for almost an entire eight hour shift
8500362 baptismal supplies gowns and certificates footprinting equipment and baby bracelets for mementos and a rocking chair
8500363 babies were taken to the soiled utility room to die
8500364 every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development
8500365 breathes or has a beating heart pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor caesarean section or induced abortion
8500366 affirm deny or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive
8500367 energy security is fundamental to our existence as an independent democratic free state
8500368 make a positive contribution to the economic health of the community
8500369 we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again
8500370 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in
8500371 we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
8500372 could you please have a second referendum on the lisbon treaty in ireland my preference would be that you have it sometime next autumn after rural ireland has been around the circuit of country and county shows after theyve seen yet another of the benefits of eu membership thank you yours etc tim worstall
8500373 its a very tragic situation doubly so right at the start of school when everyone is upbeat
8500374 i wasnt thinking right he told me he was going to kill me it wouldnt look very good if i got pulled over ive got a dead woman in the car i got her child too i got an active warrant
8500375 the marketing and promotion efforts of astrazeneca through its advertisers and sales force overstated the benefits of seroquel and minimized downplayed and concealed the risks associated with this drug
8500376 those plans were later changed because of very serious reasons
8500377 i dont mean serious as in dire i mean serious as in good business practices
8500378 producers and directors would rather be in the city limits
8500379 its great for the industry we need soundstage space we need a space for all the work thats coming in
8500380 what weve always needed is a big empty soundproof box with high ceilings and now were going to get it
8500381 in an ideal world the production office is right next to the soundstage especially when a film is stage intensive
8500382 we should be getting really busy here pretty quickly were waiting on people to dot their is and cross their ts
8500383 it wouldnt have happened at all without the pennsylvania film tax credit program as an incentive
8500384 we will be hiring quite a few people thats one of the things im most proud of were going to be putting people to work
8500385 we took advantage of that dogleg to put in a room that juts out and serves as a lantern to the neighborhood
8500386 he came back for the 100th anniversary of the carnegie library system and told us that his library card had been his most precious possession
8500387 i think its going to be great because i like to read and play on the computer
8500388 how we think about downtowns has changed completely since 1997
8500389 groups like the riverlife task force and the green building alliance werent even around back then
8500390 theres a lot of people interested in doing stuff downtown we sense there could be a clearer direction we did the stadiums what is the next big idea for downtown as a community it seems to me that we should have a say in that
8500391 could downtown pittsburgh as a downtown be a leed certified place
8500392 does that make us more competitive for investment both within the region but really more nationally that would be a tremendous thing if we could do it
8500393 its really a small thing but talk to somebody who just spent 250 000 to move downtown and all of the sudden the contractor can start at 5 a m thats a problem
8500394 if we want to get investment both public and private a downtown plan is a cost of doing business
8500395 guys lets do 10 ways to know if your teammates think youre hot ok yay
8500396 far and away the best conference in the country and its not even close
8500397 my dream is complete hitting my first home run that was the best moment i thought it had a chance because that was the best pitch i had to hit he threw a good game and made two mistakes
8500398 hes doing a great job its funny we have the same numbers its great to be there now but you kind of look at where you are at the end of the season and gauge from that
8500399 we checked on him going into the eighth and he said i feel great
8500400 he ended up throwing some pitches on that walk you have to do this a step at a time these guys get extended sometimes he will get an extra day so that will help
8500401 he gets on top of the ball hes like a whirling dervish out there hes got some deception hes got thump with the fastball hes got a sharp breaking ball hes got a slider and then he has that filthy changeup he was on tonight
8500402 the consensus seems to suggest that well be over 210 million in revenue were in line with that for next years end profit analysts are talking around 22 million but range anywhere between 20 and 25 million we think it should be around 23 million which isnt unreasonable
8500403 thats the strength of the oyster bay brand its able to continue to drive sustainable earnings at great price points
8500404 peter yealands established a crusade claiming to represent minority interests and wants oyster bay to disclose its grape prices by variety nzx regulators over a year ago stated that its a legitimate trade secret
8500405 he knew the terms and conditions of oyster bays operation when he invested in the company our view is that hes destroyed significant shareholder value over the last two years what hes really trying to do is leverage his position so delegats has to buy his minority shareholding out i have made it perfectly clear that he will not be preferred against any other shareholder he is promoting self interest and is a very unpopular figure at agm meeting time
8500406 he said well im not going to have any part of it if i dont have free access and unabated use of it sounds a bit winston peters esk to me
8500407 our customers will be able to walk in to a store select goods to purchase wave their phone over the reader see the transaction approved immediately and leave without having to open their wallet

8500432 anoles the lizards are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
8500433 still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signalling at dawn and dusk
8500434 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8500435 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night if in the morning a bird doesnt hear its neighbour or an anole doesnt see its neighbour it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
8500436 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8500437 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8500438 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8500439 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8500440 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8500441 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8500442 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop

8500444 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8500445 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8500446 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8500447 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8500448 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8500466 we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximise their beneficial role
8500467 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case
8500468 although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximise their beneficial role
8500469 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8500470 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8500471 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8500472 when you have a major disturbance like bleaching it can affect a huge area of the reef
8500473 if you have extensive reserve systems then the chances are much higher they will contain small areas within that escape bleaching which can help to recharge the reef as a whole
8500474 the great barrier reef marine park authority have put a lot of effort into determining exactly where these protected zones should be located to give the reef the best over chance of recovery from bleaching events
8500475 new protected zones need to focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts
8500476 but he said this project really looked like it was doable

8500487 unsere stellung in der welt ist geschw cht worden durch zu viel unilateralismus und zu wenig zusammenarbeit
8500488 den amerikanischen traum zu erneuern und die amerikanische f hrungsrolle in der welt wiederherzustellen
8500489 es hat 1992 nicht funktioniert weil wir auf der richtigen seite der geschichte waren und es funktioniert 2008 nicht weil barack obama auf der richtigen seite der geschichte steht

8500494 our selection and hiring process focuses upon finding the most talented teacher for our classroom openings
8500495 it may be appealing to people on the front end because the investment is low but in terms of the survival rate were still concerned that their persistence may be less
8500496 im thrilled about anything that can keep me away from driving to a bunch of night classes
8500497 im a pretty skeptical person im usually wary of fly by night things and this is not that at all
8500498 i looked at all the loans i have from law school
8500499 i didnt think this was a possibility once i completed my degree
8500500 if you want to go into teaching you usually have to know from the start
8500501 i think its great for folks who want to teach and want to try it and not necessarily spend two years getting their certification just to see if its a good fit for them

8500520 no record will ever go gold again cause theres this thing called limewire
8500521 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8500522 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8500523 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8500524 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8500525 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8500526 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8500527 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8500528 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8500529 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8500530 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8500531 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8500532 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8500533 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8500534 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8500535 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8500536 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus

8500539 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8500540 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8500541 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8500542 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8500543 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8500544 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8500545 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8500546 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8500547 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8500548 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8500549 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8500550 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8500551 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8500552 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8500553 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8500554 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here

8500556 many allegedly savvy investors lose big bucks on cow burlesque the major problem being the cows insistence on not shaving

8500559 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8500560 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8500561 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8500562 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8500563 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8500564 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8500565 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8500566 no one works for someone we all just work together
8500567 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8500568 its hard to explain what it really means itmeans though that this party has taken a step that will help this nation get behind it one of those things that have impeded our progress for a long long time
8500569 it came to me this afternoon that we did in fact succeed it in starting a journey that still is not completed but tomorrow night will get us much closer to a more perfect union
8500570 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8500571 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8500572 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8500573 first and foremost this makes it less likely well have a negative print for gdp next week he said
8500574 it the capital spending numbers was strong across the board and that was the reason to buy the aussie dollar and sell bonds
8500575 i also think there will be a gradual easing cycle of rate cuts rather than an aggressive easing cycle he said
8500576 based on current market conditions we are targeting growth in underlying eps earnings per share of at least ten per cent for the 2008 09 financial year he said
8500577 these projects will more than offset the decline in contribution from mature upstream assets such as the cooper and perth basins origin managing director grant king said
8500578 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8500579 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8500580 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8500581 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8500582 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8500583 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8500584 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8500585 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8500586 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8500587 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8500588 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8500589 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8500590 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8500591 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8500592 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8500593 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8500594 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8500595 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8500596 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8500597 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8500598 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8500599 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8500600 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8500601 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8500602 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8500603 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8500604 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8500605 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8500606 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8500607 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8500608 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8500609 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8500610 they spend a lot of time commuting or working and we would like to use that dead time to enable them to access services such as this one
8500611 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8500612 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8500613 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8500614 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8500615 not a single day since the accident have i had a day without pain
8500616 a vote for obama and biden is a vote to sustain legalized child killing
8500617 the police are enforcing the laws of obstructing traffic yet they wont enforce the laws against the killing of children
8500618 we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8500619 the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8500620 some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8500621 the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8500622 the most visible and vocal protestors demonstrating at the democratic national convention are the advocates for the unborn virtually ignored by the media they are everywhere and in the faces of delegates undaunted by the heat the ridicule and the tight restrictions placed on them by the city and ignored by the main stream media these soldiers for life battle on

8500624 i do not feel obliged to believe that the same god who has endowed us with sense reason and intellect has intended us to forego their use
8500625 missionaries are perfect nuisances and leave every place worse than they found it
8500626 jock had eyes in the back of his head we practiced in groups and he made all the rounds he knew what was going on
8500627 jock would say when you throw the ball you scruff your ear
8500628 vince dennery scooped up the ball and ran 99 yards for a touchdown
8500629 i will not comment on charles bowser except to say he was no jock sutherland
8500630 marshall goldberg got hurt in the first quarter against carnegie tech
8500631 it was a big disappointment if i remember correctly we returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown
8500632 i dont have a real answer why but there was a big rivalry between the two schools and then came carnegie tech and duquesne
8500633 larry peace had a fumble that was returned for a touchdown he was a substitute for goldberg but duke did not have a first down at all
8500634 john bowman the chancellor at pitt said you had to maintain a c average to play we lost five or six good players that way
8500635 id heard jock gave them 5 out of his own pocket and the losing team got more from the school
8500636 sutherland would fill up a five gallon milk can with water and put oats in it you drew water out of it with a sponge if you wanted a drink or to wipe your face so nobody drank any water
8500637 we had a short right field and a long left and center field
8500638 right field must have been about 200 feet away from home plate the rule was if you hit it into the stands it was a double if you hit in left or center and it went by the outfielders it was a sure home run
8500639 baseball was my first love i could have signed with detroit or the philadelphia phillies but i was drafted into world war ii
8500640 what helped me was football because all the hospital purchasing agents knew me
8500641 im still thankful to be here im a very happy man

8500677 is a very good turn of events for the city of pittsburgh
8500678 has been a sort of cavalier and ford centric individual and hasnt really been thinking about the good of the city
8500679 but that vision never materialized and as i have always said where there is no vision people perish i have no desire to perish along with luke ravenstahls pittsburgh
8500680 the way contracts are supposed to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder and the way contributions have been made to the mayor i think its self evident
8500681 understanding the actual requirements mctish kunkel submitted a bid lower than the other responsive bidder
8500682 any time we see a situation where contracts are being awarded to anyone other than the lowest responsible bidder there ought to be a reason
8500683 goes much further than pat ford pittsburgh is no longer a city that is open for business pittsburgh is a city for sale
8500684 at some point somewhere somebody has to begin critically analyzing this administration
8500685 there was concern and we will definitely work with the parents a little bit but basically hes under arrest

8500703 due to be unveiled at the 2008 paris auto show on october 2 the 2009 toyota iq is a kind of four passenger smart car its so innovative in its concept packaging and design that it might just become the new yardstick for small cars
8500704 but it was here where toyotas engineers really shone the men in white coats came up with six packaging tricks the first is a newly developed compact differential for this front wheel drive car which by itself adds more than 4 inches to the length of the interior cabin in comparison to the toyota yaris in addition radically angled rear suspension dampers and a flat fuel tank fit under the rear seats to further improve interior space the steering column comes out of the center of the car and the dash is asymmetrical while the seatbacks are especially slim even the air conditioning unit packaged within the dash is 20 percent smaller
8500705 though the iq is just 9 8 feet long and 5 5 feet wide the cabin of this preproduction car feels remarkably spacious even for our australian size frame the generous distance from your eye across the top of the dash to the steeply angled windshield adds to the feeling of interior spaciousness so the iq feels at least one class bigger and one class more luxurious than it actually is interior quality and trim level are high especially the center console which has been artfully modeled in the shape of a manta ray the seats are comfortable and available with either cloth upholstery or partial leather the asymmetrical dashboard helps move the front passenger forward enough to accommodate an adult in the rear seat of course the space behind the driver is so small that it is relegated to shopping bags or a small child
8500706 pretty much the same power and torque as now while achieving better mileage and cleaner emissions

8500714 today they are still in the maoist cantonments and they must be released immediately unmin child protection advisers unicef and its partners should have access to these children to make sure that they receive their rights to recovery and reintegration
8500715 the successful elections signal that the people of nepal are entering a hopeful phase for peace and prosperity however the promise of peace has not come to fruition for these children whose lives have been adversely affected by the conflict
8500716 last time californians voted on this issue they were overwhelmingly in support
8500717 we know the other side is about to launch a major campaign against same sex marriage so we still have a lot of work to do

8500751 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8500752 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8500753 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8500754 military ships are hardly a common way to deliver such aid
8500755 the bottom line is that were trying to capture as many tourist dollars as we can
8500756 were trying to reach out to a segment in the market that has been underserved in the past
8500757 its because theyre largely dual income with no kids and also because they like to travel more than the average person
8500758 they also are willing to pay the higher hotel rates which chapel hill has
8500759 when i travel i often look to see if theres a gay bar or if theres a glbt community center
8500760 it would be difficult to target the glbt community as a tourist market without having a stronger more visible gay community
8500761 especially in carrboro if you kiss nobodys going to look twice
8500762 ive been around when all the different gay nights popped up here and there then failed
8500763 we have all the pieces we just need to put it together
8500764 there are days when we run out of those resources
8500765 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it

8500771 gerry seidl 68 appeared before judge kevin delahanty without an attorney to represent him
8500772 obviously we want to try and do things in a fashion thats convenient for motorists but our number one concern is the safety of the people on the course
8500773 the u of k game and u of l game is not going to be impacted as much as you might think
8500774 thats going to be really the major change if you were planning on getting there from taylor boulevard or some street west of 3rd street or 4th street youre not going to be able to do it
8500775 the fairgrounds kentucky exposition center is by far the best option yes it does cost six dollars to park there but id say its six dollars well spent
8500776 the main thing is to be patient be courteous and be safe
8500777 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8500778 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8500779 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8500780 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the in summer by 2030 or so
8500781 the sale is a great business decision we are delighted we look forward to expanding the brand even further to chicago and tokyo

8500789 our nation is in trouble on two fronts the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened middle class and low income americans are hurting with incomes declining job losses poverty and inequality rising mortgage foreclosures and credit card debt increasing health care coverage disappearing and a very big spike in the cost of food utilities and gasoline
8500790 and our position in the world has been weakened by too much unilateralism and too little cooperation by a perilous dependence on imported oil by a refusal to lead on global warming by a growing indebtedness and a dependence on foreign lenders by a severely burdened military by a backsliding on global nonproliferation and arms control agreements and by a failure to consistently use the power of diplomacy from the middle east to africa to latin america to central and eastern europe
8500791 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs his policies on the economy on taxes on health care on energy are far superior to the republican alternatives
8500792 he obama has shown a clear grasp of foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military his family heritage and his life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation in an ever more interdependent world
8500793 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
8500794 he will put us back in the forefront of the worlds fight against global warming and the fight to reduce nuclear chemical and biological weapons he will continue and enhance our nations commendable global leadership in an area in which i am deeply involved the fight against aids tuberculosis and malaria including and this is very important a renewal of the battle against hiv and aids here at home
8500795 these challenges cry out for american ideas and american innovation when barack obama unleashes them america will save lives win new allies open new markets and create wonderful new jobs for our own people
8500796 they took us from record surpluses to an exploding debt
8500797 think about it more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans that will swell the deficit increase inequality and weaken the economy more band aids for health care that will enrich insurance companies impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured more going it alone in the world instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence
8500798 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8500799 larry can you be any more of a yankee apologist just look past your yankee myopia and try some objectivity
8500800 wow larry youve produced 25 of the comments on this thread and said nothing meaningful thats impressive even for you
8500801 after reading all your postings and daily weblog i believe you have truly become the phil pepe of this generation now this is not necessarily a good thing
8500802 you blog sucks it reeds as it was written by the queer son of mike lupica and roids clemens i could write a better column by letting a monkey fuk a typewriter i dont need no 181 million dollar team to write a blog fukkk the spankeees
8500803 i think his followers have a different sexual preference than most men
8500804 im not qualified to write for online media let alone mainstream media
8500805 you have become estranged from christ you who attempt to be justified by law you have fallen from grace
8500806 god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory
8500807 forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same
8500808 but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son
8500809 now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things
8500810 and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life
8500811 the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god
8500812 born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god
8500813 but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you
8500814 now this i say unto you brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption
8500815 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me gal ii 20
8500816 i will behold thy face in righteousness i shall be satisfied when i awake with thy likeness
8500817 for i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god whom i shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another though my reins be consumed within me
8500818 beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure
8500819 feminism is a socialist anti family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands kill their children practice witchcraft destroy capitalism and become lesbians
8500820 what ends up happening with mannequin training is the players see the seams
8500821 theyre trained to play the seams and play balls between the seams
8500822 their final passing is absolutely exquisite and i have a friend that was the assistant womens coach for the arsenal women
8500823 so since she knew i was a wenger fan she would send me e mails
8500824 it really helps the midfielder kick the ball with the right spin and the right speed
8500825 when you find the seam in a game youve seen it a lot so its easier
8500826 final passing is one of the hardest things in soccer to master
8500827 we still have a lot of work and a lot of improvement to go
8500828 degrade for students the educational value of the college search process
8500829 i believe public officials should strive whenever possible to conduct their business in public
8500830 were talking about a lot of stuff were not ready to reveal yet
8500831 i think you can understand why we wouldnt want that in the dth
8500832 we are trying to raise the next generation of mass transit users
8500833 if an activity fits in we borrow some of the activities from the summer camps
8500834 if someone drinks a soda at work we save the can and then make it an experiment out of air pressure and density
8500835 we turned off the lights and there was a weird electric device there were giant sparks about this long
8500836 they love to watch the kids enthusiasm for science grow and change
8500837 i feel that kids are always surprising with their ingenuity and creativity
8500838 its really good to have that kind of perspective because when youre learning around college students you only get that one type of learning experience
8500839 its sort of taken a little longer to hit them there
8500840 its not the first time that weve had an increase in both employment and unemployment
8500841 its a lot of factors weve got more people employed and more people out of jobs than ever before in north carolina history
8500842 were still getting job orders in a lot of our offices
8500843 were just not getting them at the pace that weve been used to for the past few years
8500844 there are some people that have lost jobs who live in orange county
8500845 we have unemployment lower than our sister counties around us but that doesnt mean that everybodys fine and everybodys happy
8500846 when i drive around town it seems like a lot of people arent very busy
8500847 now while things are going well it is a good time to talk about and plan how we might respond if things did tighten up considerably
8500848 when one admits that nothing is certain one must i think also admit that some things are much more nearly certain than others
8500849 discipline trains you to put up with disappointments every rose has a thorn
8500850 i used to work in a fire hydrant factory you couldnt park anywhere near the place
8500851 you just put your antennas out into the world and decide you want to see things that arent usually noticed by people
8500852 you are essentially making light of situations that we all fall victim to
8500853 its better for me to come out and expect total silence and almost hatred from the crowd
8500854 that makes me work that much harder to try to be funny
8500855 im usually just trying not to projectile vomit on the audience
8500856 i loosen up with a beer and by having a few laughs myself
8500857 i think if i can feel like im not just giving a lecture if i can ad lib some responses i feel like im doing a strong show
8500858 but if a girl tries to do that they become a tomboy
8500859 if anyones thinking about trying out stand up its a cool place to start

8500862 no political party is above the law i have told the police to take stern action if there is any problem
8500863 every government department knows its job well the bmc will take care of the signboard deadline and the police will tackle street violence
8500864 all police stations have been instructed to deal sternly with any kind of vandalism
8500865 we will not back out we will not allow further insult of the marathi language
8500866 they tried to humiliate me and i was not going to be humiliated over this

8500870 i am happy because we have played two games and won two games but it is difficult
8500871 we now have a big derby on sunday and all the teams are very good
8500872 hopefully weve got all the injuries at the start of the season and we can get everyone back fit more or less after the international break
8500873 in a way its fallen nicely for us having only two league games in the first four or five weeks of the season when weve got a few injuries
8500874 now were back in the champions league thats juves true home
8500875 we need wins to move up the table and to give us confidence
8500876 were absolutely convinced that we have the right man for the job and that were heading in the right direction we have absolute patience im not worked up all im completely calm we drew ten times last year and we ended up champions by ten points
8500877 could you take a look at this post you didnt respond and id like your input
8500878 du skal ikke tro du er lige s meget som os
8500879 its improving all the time but we can still do better
8500880 we deal with blue chip clients and the government and they are not known to be the quickest payers as much as we love them its difficult to extract cash out of them
8500881 its happened much quicker than expected but more is to come
8500882 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8500883 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8500884 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8500885 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the in summer by 2030 or so
8500886 some of the veteran players saw it and picked it up and passed it along to him and hes trying to make the adjustment
8500887 its not easy to do you have to change your motion a bit and change where you set and where you start sometimes
8500888 thats the plan to be able to play on monday
8500889 the only concern is my speed and how much ill be able to run
8500890 we need michael to go out and play consistently as far as his approach to the plate
8500891 i know defensively hes been pretty good in the outfield and hasnt had any problems and made some good plays and has made adjustments there
8500892 i just want to see the hitting part be more consistent and hit balls to left field and make better contact and have a better approach at the plate young players need to be consistent and the only way they can get consistent is they have to play
8500893 just a guess in my part at this point in time but i would probably say no
8500894 things can change i dont way to say never but if i had a guess right now id probably say no
8500895 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8500896 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8500897 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8500898 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8500899 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8500900 the van was carrying policemen and jail staff when it was hit by an explosives laden car which was used in the attack
8500901 the first to be brought out was sarita the wife of billu ram she was injured after that his four children were rescued
8500902 later billo ram his brother tarsem and his wife ritu were rescued some of the hostages are still in shock
8500903 i had lost hope i had given up it was gods grace that they the children are safe i am also thankful to the army for getting them out
8500904 the operation is over our special forces have killed third militant early today
8500905 they militants said we will kill you we pleaded with them not to kill us and said take all the belongings and cash but please spare us we have small children
8500906 we were trapped inside the house they came inside the house and started firing we went out of the kitchen into the bedroom and they again started firing we kept screaming they warned us not to go out of the room or they will fire they did not even give water to the children
8500907 we were in the kitchen somebody was at the gate and we thought it was the army but they broke the door and started firing
8500908 they killed one boy they asked us to come out of the kitchen we came out they started firing i was scared
8500909 three unidentified people came into the house when they came they killed three people we were in another room and locked the door they tried to break the door but couldnt we did not talk to them we were in one corner of the room they were just firing there were totally nine of us inside
8500910 the new endowment allows us to create a stable financial base to support staff salaries for those people the ackland trusts cannot support and are essential to the work of the institution
8500911 it had been going on for a long long time and significant sources of support had not been identified
8500912 some funds had been raised to nowhere near the amount to be able to begin construction
8500913 when we got a new director she did a fierce inventory of where we were what our buildings current needs were and what our long term needs were
8500914 we can expand our exhibitions and collection without having to invest in a building
8500915 this isnt going to last forever its a temporary solution but its the right one for now
8500916 we had already been worried that if we were to get an expanded building that wed be very short staffed
8500917 everything would be increased and it seems much wiser to bring more experienced staff and points of view first to get people established before we start thinking about the bigger building
8500918 its bringing new life different people with new perspectives into the ackland art museum we can increase the kinds of exhibitions we can do and our efficiency
8500919 we spend much of our time trying to raise money to pay the staff we have and with this endowment we can create a huge foundation to build on
8500920 i think that the vision for the future of the ackland is as exciting as its ever been
8500921 we have one of the most outstanding collections in the region we can make this even more available
8500922 how often do you get to see such good bands for free at an all ages show
8500923 theres no way it will be done before the wedding there is just too much planning and stuff that needs to be done itll probably be spring before anything gets released
8500924 we underestimated how nice it is to be 30 seconds down the street downhill
8500925 weve grown the business pretty significantly since we got to this spot
8500926 the location helped a lot where we were before we were kind of hidden in a basement
8500927 but were right on the cusp of needing more space
8500928 we want to carry all kinds of books people are gonna see and want
8500929 something people are gonna see and say wow thats pretty
8500930 were still trying to keep up with what were doing in one space
8500931 if a bigger boy knocked me down my mother told me to bloody his nose so i could walk the street the next day

8500937 30 years of feminism have emancipated women but emasculated men while girls gained their freedom to sleep with whom they wanted and to succeed in any career they chose to pursue boys were gradually formed by social pressure into what women confused and giddy with their new found freedom thought they wanted their men to be
8500938 the family unit will become happier and stronger as we play our natural roles
8500939 there will be a return to the stable marriages of the fifties and sixties as the man feels free to do things he wants to do and to be himself
8500940 it seemed to me like the truck was coming towards us it was in the extreme left lane the taxi was behind the truck travelling in the same direction when he the truck driver suddenly decided to turn right
8500941 there was a woman trapped in the front seat and she had to be cut out she was airlifted to johannesburg hospital a man was airlifted to chris hani baragwanath hospital
8500942 im sitting here with a mangled taxi rammed into my bonnet
8500943 the robot was red and we were just sitting here when there was a massive bang and i saw the truck fall over
8500944 regular patrols for the protection of our marine resources against poaching and pollution in our economic exclusion zone eez
8500945 massive potential in terms of fish mineral and fossil wealth the failure to patrol one cannot control without patrol is a departure from international trends verging on dereliction of duty
8500946 the unrestricted plundering of valuable resources like the patagonian tooth fish
8500947 shadow of its original force structure with a number of gaps apparent in its capacity
8500948 the answer therefore logically lies in a redefinition of the role of the navy especially in peacetime
8500949 from a political point of view there is no question that politicians especially after the whole defence arms acquisition furore require the so called bang for buck
8500950 the sa navy seriously suffering a serious lack of credibility has yet to pay its way the sa navy is convinced that a south african coast guard must be established as a separate flotilla
8500951 with each passing month and year it becomes more obvious how misguided and plain incompetent it was of the anc government to purchase enormously expensive highly sophisticated weapons without proper forethought
8500952 they could have done without the submarines and bought cheaper corvettes from spain we did not need the gripens or the hawks
8500953 by saving billions we could then have had the finances to purchase the vessels that the navy is now requesting
8500954 we view the threat in an extremely serious light it has been reported to the police weve imposed on them the seriousness of the matter
8500955 were working very closely with them to ensure the safety of staff and their families

8500977 i dont go into games thinking about the record against the reds but just try to remember what i did to them in games past and how i got different guys out
8500978 i try to stick with a game plan and execute it until they adjust and try to do something else
8500979 i dont think roy cruises or anything but he really showed me what he has on that at bat
8500980 after the last pitch he gave me a little stare and i kind of got goose bumps because i love competition it was awesome even though i lost
8500981 he has almost no fear and has really good stuff and that combination leads to a lot of success i wasnt around for about 21 of those wins of his but he looked liked one of the best pitchers in baseball tonight
8500982 any time you can give your pitchers more than one run to work with it enables them to go out there and pump the zone
8500983 josh is a guy that is tricky a lot of times because hes got several pitches he locates well
8500984 he was tough but with roy on the mound you dont have to get a whole lot it was fortunate we were able to scratch a couple across
8500985 i lost command and threw some pitches over the middle of the plate and got the pitch count up early and started worrying about that until the third inning when they starting swinging on me early in the count

8501089 we want to see him do some catching and playing some first base too
8501090 i feel comfortable at third i played there in 2006
8501091 i cant tell you right now whats going to happen i try to do everything i try to do my best
8501092 he has incredibly soft hands and for a guy his size hes got quick feet
8501093 im not sure if hes ready to play third base on an everyday basis but with his ability if they want to put him there he can handle it i think one day that would not be a bad option if they groom him he could play any of the three positions
8501094 you look good every time you move over a runner
8501095 my dream is complete hitting my first home run that was the best moment i thought it had a chance because that was the best pitch i had to hit he threw a good game and made two mistakes
8501096 hes doing a great job its funny we have the same numbers its great to be there now but you kind of look at where you are at the end of the season and gauge from that

8501100 we realize that there are more and more demands in this business at this level and in order to get the job done you need more people doing it it s really as simple as that

8501118 barack obama understands that for a commander in chief to support the military he needs more than a mission accomplished banner more than a borrowed flight suit and definitely more than four more years of the same failed foreign policy
8501119 barack obama stands out because he understands that people want government to work for them again
8501120 during these tough economic times he is deeply concerned for our children our families and those who have been left behind
8501121 the kane county health department will be conducting an on site inspection of the walter paytons roundhouse after several complaints about flies within the meals
8501122 please stay away until the kane county health department issues their official findings
8501123 i clearly meant it solely as a fyi to my colleagues
8501124 apparently the health department takes these complaints very seriously but it was not my intention to be mean spirited or shut down the roundhouse i just wanted peace of mind
8501125 the roundhouse had a bad day with flies and i had a bad day in judgment
8501126 but the measure of a man is how you bounce back and i will bounce back with professionalism and work to improve the overall business climate of aurora anyone who gives me a chance will see this was an isolated incident and is not a pattern or a trend of manny maysonet

8501130 i have an unwavering commitment to best serve citizens of aurora and improve our business climate
8501131 i will continue to bring new initiatives and best economic development practices to the city of aurora
8501132 they were two wonderful people and they didnt deserve this

8501148 my conversations with coach bromley are that he wants this not to ruin anthonys life
8501149 he thinks that anthony has a bright future and that hopefully the cal poly mustangs will be a part of that future
8501150 the situation with his scholarship and his ability to play basketball are still being looked at
8501151 he is eligible to attend cal poly as there is no basis under title v or california education code that precludes him from enrolling in classes
8501152 and we hope this is viewed as youthful indiscretion not as an act of a hardened criminal
8501153 coaches get an attachment to players and develop a different kind of relationship with players
8501154 thats why universities set policies that allow decisions to be made at a higher level
8501155 how pissed would you be if you spent tens of thousands of dollars and they changed the film to the goosebumps movie

8501210 for giants fans i am sure he brings back memories of juan marichal
8501211 in info shared with me from other people they will ask how can you do this well how can i not give a guy with his pedigree a fourth start
8501212 they say that i am giving up on the season how lame is that you have to give him a viable opportunity
8501213 timmy is honest there have been a couple of games when he said that his legs are cramping he was adamant that he felt great and the pen had been used quite a bit
8501214 you work so hard and you feel like your team is going to be good but you never know until you play
8501215 theres no way to tell but im excited because i see so much talent i see us working together well and i see us making plays
8501216 i think theyre ready to play against someone else theyve worked hard
8501217 i dont know that theyd feel like they theres anything else they can do right now except for playing in a game theyve invested the work so now its time to game plan and execute the game plan
8501218 hes a great athlete with a really strong arm who gets the ball to us really fast hes taken complete control of the huddle
8501219 i think they are confident in us because of our focus on mental assignments
8501220 were physically good enough to play and that all becomes a lot easier and freer when were confident in what were doing
8501221 weve had the luxury of having two great backs for a long time
8501222 there may be a learning curve and those are the growing pains of being young
8501223 but were going to be fine because i know that theyre going to come back with their best efforts

8501230 the whole biden family on this journey with me to take america back
8501231 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the effort to take america back
8501232 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8501233 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8501234 what we came up with is a way to save and salvage the private property rights of the cobbs as well as pleasing the community by saving the property and preserving its heritage
8501235 this does not mean that some individual cant come in and just purchase the property to restore it themselves
8501236 it doesnt alleviate any other option of someone doing it but were trying to be proactive to come up with some good options because we have not seen anyone else come up with anything
8501237 c mo fue posible que esta acta y este plano jam s localizados entre los papeles que conservaba mi abuelo estuvieran esper ndome aqu es un milagro

8501240 we want to make sure that everybody who wants to come and join in the party and join in the effort to take this country back
8501241 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader

8501245 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8501246 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8501247 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8501248 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8501249 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8501250 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8501251 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8501252 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8501253 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8501254 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8501255 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8501256 its amazing how you lose your muscle tone and mass when youre not using it
8501257 at the last count i had heard over 400 and i know more came in after that

8501368 the team in general feels confident that we can make the playoffs this year for sure
8501369 we all know we have the talent its just a matter of putting it together
8501370 the falcons are probably pretty direct in how they play
8501371 we play a pretty attacking brand of soccer with a lot of focus on the quality of our passing
8501372 i think its fun for the fans to watch and i think it made a lot of people soccer fans last year

8501375 its going to be good in two days im sure i was thinking more of it than i was actually feeling the pain so its not really a big deal in that certain moment i felt big pain so i just had to tape the ankle but its going to be all right
8501376 that was kind of a turning point in my career
8501377 i started believing after the finals that i really can win i knew it was a matter of time i just needed to work and really dedicate myself to it so thats what i did and it paid off
8501378 i have a different approach to the grand slams because as a grand slam winner you gain much more confidence
8501379 yesterday august 28 1995 i met my sister pam for the first time my first thought as she stood outside the door is that she is beautiful
8501380 i didnt play quite as well as i did the other day in the first round didnt find my rhythm but sometimes you just have to get through these matches
8501381 i still look at it as this is where i should be if im healthy and can play halfway decent
8501382 it was only when i got back from china maybe last saturday that i was able to start practising for singles
8501383 so to expect i would be out here and be perfect is probably shooting for the stars a little bit too much
8501384 i dont feel like im that far off i just feel im timing the ball just a little bit late not as perfect as id like it to be if i can get that going hit more penetrating shots i feel i can turn my game around
8501385 thats not what it takes to run and win a statewide campaign

8501391 our children are our most important resource and like any other resource they need to be taken seriously and handled with care
8501392 they deserve all of the tools necessary to succeed in life sports is one of these tools there is no greater success that our generation can lay claim to than to be able to say that we didnt let our young people down

8501403 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8501404 not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8501405 no other country on earth is my story even possible
8501406 that is the true genius of america a faith in the simple dreams of its people the insistence on small miracles
8501407 few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change
8501408 together starting today let us finish the work that needs to be done and usher in a new birth of freedom on this earth
8501409 you have done what the cynics said we couldnt do
8501410 you came together as democrats republicans and independents to stand up and say that we are one nation we are one people and our time for change has come
8501411 you have to look at american culture and the fact that its been 400 years for these kind of racial attitudes to develop racial behaviors to materialize and youre certainly not going to wipe that out with just someone being elected to any office in the united states
8501412 i have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidacy particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own
8501413 when we passed civil rights bills in 64 and 65 and under lyndon johnson racial attitudes didnt change for a long time but over time as a result of those bills they changed dramatically and in the same way martin luther king didnt change peoples attitudes immediately but over time he had an enormous impact

8501419 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8501420 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8501421 un incremento de las lluvias que ser n fuertes en las provincias orientales en especial en las zonas monta osas y la costa sur con riesgo de inundaciones y desprendimientos de tierra
8501422 se mantendr n las fuertes marejadas en ambas costas orientales con posibles inundaciones en la ciudad norte a de baracoa
8501423 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8501424 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8501425 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8501426 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8501427 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8501428 there are a lot of things that have to come together in order for something that fantastic to happen
8501429 they ran for over eight hours and i didnt hear a single complaint over the course of that day
8501430 the idea that were playing both stanford and nebraska on our home floor is amazing
8501431 i created the schedule with the strategic intent of trying to really test our team with non conference opponents
8501432 that way when we get to the big west well really be ready it will be downright embarrassing to me if we dont pack mott gym it wasnt easy to get nebraska to come here they sell out every match for them to travel is a big thing
8501433 its definitely something that well remember when were out there on saturday
8501434 theyre going to try to right a wrong and weve got to see if we can return to the scene of the crime and play our best football
8501435 weve got a good number of people who were there and felt what it was like to play in an nfl stadium
8501436 itll help calm the demeanor in the locker room and help the young guys know what to expect
8501437 their offense is the same offense their defense is a similar defense
8501438 i felt it was a little unnecessary and kind of unreasonable
8501439 sixty days was the bare minimum that they legally had to give us
8501440 it took us nearly the entire 60 days to find a new place to lease
8501441 i dont think were a shopping center sort of business
8501442 a lot of the little small mom and pop type stores like ours are having to either go out of business or move out of downtown
8501443 if youre in a place where you dont get a lot of walk in traffic its hard to keep things going
8501444 the vertical space is really nice and makes it feel larger
8501445 we have a dry cleaner type conveyer that will allow us use a lot of the vertical space its also an easy building to find and we have our own parking its a lot better parking situation than weve ever had in the past
8501446 the san luis obispo little theatre is doing a production of ray
8501447 the production spans from the 50s to the 70s weve provided all the costumes for that so thats anything from a shark skin suit to a leather 70s jacket and go go boots they rely heavily on us for that kind of stuff
8501448 its mainly a networking tool for area musicians so they can come together buy and sell gear post classified ads and help each other find gigs
8501449 they can put up band pages some already have but we really want to make sure its not just another myspace page or facebook page we want them to use it in a more professional way like resumes to help them actually book gigs
8501450 its been a lot of work and sometimes i thought it was never going to happen
8501451 its doing something for the community in general letting them see everybody thats out there that you might not hear about on your own
8501452 a leximancer analysis of social marketing definitions versus social marketing literature
8501453 ive been flying back and forth to la pursuing my acting career if i fly back and forth twice a month thats like 250 000 round trip bleep that im back on american airlines now and im in coach
8501454 we are one of only a handful of charities in westchester county to receive this certification for sound management visibility and transparency
8501455 this evaluation by a respected third party should assure our donors that their money will be well spent and benefit the communities served

8501463 i cant tell you right now whats going to happen i try to do everything i try to do my best
8501464 he has incredibly soft hands and for a guy his size hes got quick feet
8501465 im not sure if hes ready to play third base on an everyday basis but with his ability if they want to put him there he can handle it i think one day that would not be a bad option if they groom him he could play any of the three positions
8501466 you look good every time you move over a runner
8501467 right now im not really making veal stock im barely using chicken stock so theres other things i dont need to do as much
8501468 right now were pretty much using as many tomatoes as we can
8501469 we take like three or four or five different types of heirloom tomatoes with some good olive oil balsamic fleur de sel toss it all together then we put a little spoonful of our homemade ricotta and a little bit of cooked farro on there and basil very traditional flavors but theyre just exciting because everythings at its peak
8501470 a mix of local heirlooms pickled watermelon rind watermelon habenero sorbet compressed rhubarb tomato water a small amount of pecorino and then a truffled compressed peach its summer tastic
8501471 its just blown up i think people are starting to appreciate the sweetness more i think theyre looking at tomatoes less as vegetables and more as fruit not all heirloom tomatoes are super acidic
8501472 the predictability of csa is probably an advantage you know ahead of time what your volume is going to be and farmers have the ability to plan but the diversity of products that the restaurants can use is much higher than with a csa list
8501473 it rained every day but i got the job done now i feel very confident in trying to win this event
8501474 my goal is to win and try to forget about everything else and what it all means

8501484 now the question is how many fields and courts are here or there how far apart are they and how can they be put together in an efficient situation
8501485 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them

8501487 insert game here is greater than the sum of its parts
8501488 barack obama est preparado para liderar estados unidos y restaurar su liderazgo en el mundo barack obama est listo para ser presidente de estados unidos
8501489 hillary os dijo ayer de una manera inequ voca que har lo posible para que obama salga elegido en noviembre este compromiso habla por los dos
8501490 los republicanos me dec an que era muy joven y muy inexperto para ser el comandante en jefe os suena familiar no les funcion en 1992 y no les funcionar ahora porque barack obama est en el lado correcto de la historia
8501491 nuestro pa s es menos seguro y est m s aislado ahora que en ning n otro momento en la historia reciente
8501492 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8501493 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8501494 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom

8501497 an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
8501498 nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral questions of our time the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to oppression and violence man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge aggression and retaliation the foundation of such a method is love
8501499 pro life faction but you can bet that there are people who would do so i once had occasion to call an anti abortion talk show on our local public access tv station
8501500 the commission concluded that the article was clearly misleading as it did not make clear that the complaint had come from the journalist herself
8501501 the newspaper had also overstated the position regarding the alleged investigation and in doing so had failed to take care not to publish inaccurate material
8501502 these were serious matters which could not be easily or proportionately remedied with an apology and resulted in a breach of clause 1 accuracy of the code
8501503 we also accept mr bains assurances that the asf has not paid for any flights he has taken to scotland
8501504 we accept mr bain had no interest in the harris tweed industry in 1993 when the asf gave funds to the highland fund which decided to use the money to purchase a prototype loom
8501505 we are happy to set the records straight and apologise to mr bain and his family and to asf for any distress caused
8501506 yellowstone is located atop of one of the few large volcanic hotspots on earth
8501507 but though the hot material is a volcanic plume its cooler than others of its kind such as one in hawaii
8501508 although yellowstone sits above a plume of hot material coming up from deep with the earth its a remarkably lukewarm plume
8501509 it would be a mistake to write off yellowstone as a dead volcano a hot plume even a slightly cooler one is still hot
8501510 we have to rush to educate people on the traffic laws
8501511 and we have to enforce laws like helmets for motorbike riders and their passengers
8501512 we have sought a jail sentence of two and a half years against yeh sheng mao for hiding important documents that resulted in prosecutors losing their optimal time in their probes into the alleged money laundering case
8501513 creeping around back doors dropping hints and providing media speculation but not finding any evidence of wrongdoing or illegality
8501514 i am prepared to wait on the court steps for them and if they dont turn up they can go away for ever
8501515 if your opponent is quick to anger seek to irritate him

8501522 well from what i know of him hes a pretty good guy
8501523 to me this looks like burning a very important bridge
8501524 we live in a global economy we want foreign investment and there can be no doubt about this we cannot build a developed country on energy prices alone
8501525 we believe the move intended to show that russia is willing to put economic and other interests on the table in order to defend its policy toward georgia
8501526 the image of medvedev as a liberal has been terminally devalued in the eyes of europe he has become a figure rousing provocation rather than sympathy
8501527 we do not want a new cold war no one has ever gained from it
8501528 advanced amateur photographers blur the line between the hobbyist and the professional looking for professional features and capabilities in their equipment that will allow them to capture that awe inspiring image

8501571 we dont expect you to handle all of his discipline

8501575 what about the deli on the corner would that be okay
8501576 you want to study here i could get my books
8501577 ive done enough for the day if you want to go back to your house
8501578 though you havent managed to do any if you want to stay here
8501579 home sounds good we can try again tomorrow today hasnt quite worked out

8501581 its our first time together mr mason but ive been in here with my dads

8501583 thank you sir you can call either of my dads if youd like theyll give permission for me to be here and this is my sub rodney mckay
8501584 thats not necessary youre obviously mature enough if you have any questions just let me know
8501585 these would look really good on you the blacks too stark
8501586 you trusted me from the beginning do you know how hot that was i want to test you test us learn our limits i want to tie you up i know youll like that submitting to me letting me do whatever i want youd never know what i might do next but id always make sure youd enjoy it
8501587 i always want to know what youre thinking and feeling
8501588 the cuffs are a good choice i love the cuffs and could we go before i embarrass myself
8501589 some young people start too fast try to leap into hard play
8501590 were going to have a long time to experiment together
8501591 they saw all the parents and made sure the kids were disciplined twenty with the strap for each one theyre going to play tonight dinner is in the fridge
8501592 what does it mean that theyre playing are they really having sex on a saturday afternoon leaving you alone
8501593 im usually out with friends or studying anyway gil likes adam to have sunday to recover if theyre going to play hard
8501594 of course not at least not anything adam doesnt like
8501595 whats the point of being in a relationship then if youre not going to enjoy each other
8501596 i would have thought your top would want to the biological
8501597 gil thinks adam is more handsome and smarter than him they talked about having another kid with gil as the biological but we travel so much it never happened
8501598 what do you think rodney would you rather i was blond
8501599 you rescued me and fought for me and make me feel good and you even cook for me and make my sister laugh
8501600 im sorry your life is going to be different now
8501601 i know what you need you need to not think i want to take you there where you only know sensation
8501602 you look so good like that ready for me to tie you up in any position i want
8501603 good i want you to feel your body rodney and know that im the one making you feel like that
8501604 get used to this im going to keep you marked here always
8501605 but i want you to have another mark too one for just the two of us
8501606 good i want you at my mercy i dont want you to think about anything except us and what im doing to you
8501607 this one first i think ill do the other one when it begins to fade
8501608 that looks so good youre so hot rodney your skin is so pale and it looks beautiful when its reddened
8501609 i bet these will be all red when i release them
8501610 you liked being spanked this morning didnt you your ass is so pretty when it glows red from my hand
8501611 not tonight i think youve had enough of this now
8501612 if you like but i dont want to come until im in you
8501613 dinners nuking ive got three minutes to feast on these
8501614 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8501615 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8501616 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8501617 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8501618 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8501619 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8501620 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8501621 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8501622 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8501623 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8501624 the journey will be difficult the road will be long
8501625 it is appropriate given abramoffs extraordinary cooperation to date cooperation which can be wholly or partially credited for the convictions of a member of congress five high level legislative branch officials one high level executive branch official and two other mid to low level public officials
8501626 assisted with the governments investigation of scores of other persons who have not yet been charged
8501627 every day i hear from moms confirming that they feel overwhelmed with the amount of activities they have to organize during the school year
8501628 not only do they have to stay on top of their own familys activities but many of them are also required to volunteer at their school and help plan events for their kids groups
8501629 as a working mother of two school aged children and a former teacher i know first hand how difficult it is to successfully manage peak planning times especially the back to school season
8501630 there is no active partition are you sure you want to apply changes
8501631 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products
8501632 sfca maintains that it is not responsible for products previously manufactured by simplicity inc
8501633 i think perhaps she was shocked and didnt know what to say
8501634 shes representative of what happens to the patients we see
8501635 a lot of the patients we see think theyre going crazy
8501636 its appropriate for doctors to ask about stress the mistake is to assume thats what it is
8501637 their reactions made me feel like a whiner like i was making up all of these bizarre symptoms
8501638 if he had called a year ago we wouldnt even have considered it
8501639 we work with them to help them better understand nutritional planning physical activity those kinds of things
8501640 id been going through some health issues at home when krista called
8501641 these are the big key areas we can work on first
8501642 a lot of people dont realize that after age 2 children dont need whole milk
8501643 we used to get one case of fresh fruit a week
8501644 dont play into negativity or youll see the results play out in your own life
8501645 is that i could see both sides the person doing the threatening was a petite lady who probably wouldnt hurt a fly but i was hired to diffuse the tension and get this company back to a relative calm state
8501646 if you dont educate yourself about stress youll suffer emotionally financially and in your key relationships
8501647 stress management skills should be taught to small children to employees and to anyone breathing everybodys under some type of stress
8501648 i am a problem solving individual who brings stability to the group
8501649 sure our finances may be rocky but we have to create some options i think we can manage just fine if we do whats really going to help
8501650 i didnt give her the usual routine of saying i was sorry
8501651 i said instead that id like to take her and her husband to dinner
8501652 i laid out the fine points of why i entrusted so much to this lady
8501653 i knew this husband was probably in a mode anybody can get into
8501654 you get stressed and tired and you think a divorce will bring relief but i can personally tell you that a new mate brings on a whole new set of problems several of my friends are on their third marriage
8501655 es reicht eine einzige frage sind vater und mutter deutsche und stammen diese wiederum von deutschen ab fertig das ist doch gar nicht so schwer
8501656 es ist klar zu unterscheiden zwischen auslandsdeutschen und fremden die im inland leben ein mensch zum beispiel der deutsche eltern hat aber im ausland zum beispiel in chile oder ru land geboren wurde gilt als deutscher ein t rke der in wien oder frankfurt main geboren wurde jedoch nicht das gleiche prinzip l t sich auch auf die staatsb rgerschaft bertragen
8501657 you want to send them a little subliminal message that youre willing to sacrifice for the team
8501658 when they get here for training camp theyll see what im talking about
8501659 if brent barry is playing for a team you know hes playing to win a ring
8501660 hes got one already and im sure hes not trying to take any steps backward im playing with tracy whos desperate to win im desperate to win its just a win win situation
8501661 the ron that rick had in sacramento wed do the trade just for that ron
8501662 if we didnt have such a solid locker room it would be harder to add someone like ron but weve got solid solid veterans
8501663 i dont want it to be the story that ron artest is going to get them over the hump they were already over the hump if we stay healthy we should be ok
8501664 tom is a good guy but after 18 years i think it was time to move in another direction
8501665 he knows the players and he knows the township issues i didnt want us to lose a guy like that
8501666 after 18 years of service we should have offered him a settlement and allowed him to leave with dignity not give him the ax while hes on vacation
8501667 its hard to believe how much happens in one day here
8501668 it took a little government intervention to make that happen
8501669 i think it was the right move at the right time
8501670 its a destination spot where people will want to come to
8501671 we dont want to have traffic backing up on the interstate
8501672 this is not good i have a family four kids
8501673 we have grown into a bedroom community and we continue to see new businesses and buildings coming up in places that used to be abandoned buildings
8501674 i see much of the life i knew when i was growing up here
8501675 i see kennywood where i played as a child and the steel mill where i worked for many years
8501676 the statue was taken down melted to use the steel during world war ii
8501677 we always want to put much of the communitys history into the portrait
8501678 our goal is to inspire young artists to believe in themselves enough to pursue their artistic skills
8501679 my administration was immediately interested in mr holbrooks project when he proposed it last year because he looked at a bunch of young people and instead of seeing problems he saw their potential and he chose to invest in them
8501680 weve been on a roller coaster for the past few years
8501681 hopefully we are looking at a baseline now and we will start moving in one direction up
8501682 we have to find ways to market bellevue in different ways
8501683 now we shut down around 5 p m we have no nightlife but if we can turn the community into a destination this town could be hopping on weekends and evenings
8501684 another pizzeria is not going to bring newcomers to bellevue
8501685 destination stores and restaurants will attract young residents and out of towners
8501686 i too would like to see a more diverse shopping district
8501687 it would be good to see a mens clothing store again and a couple more restaurants
8501688 the cost of rent is less than in the city
8501689 it was a good way to introduce wine to a dry town
8501690 bellevue is in a perfect location to draw young people its right on port authority bus lines and its only a few minutes from downtown but if you want to attract young people to live here you must give them something to do in their town including having a drink with their meals
8501691 ive seen a lot more changes in the past seven months we have a proactive council that has a vision for the future
8501692 you can get good prices on big homes within walking distance of our business district
8501693 lot of people like to go out and eat and have a glass of wine id rather see them stay in bellevue more diners equals more shoppers and more potential home buyers
8501694 my personal opinion i see nothing wrong with restaurants serving wine
8501695 but what happens will depend on what the majority of borough residents want to do if it gets on the ballot the question will be decided by the voters
8501696 when a store becomes vacant it usually stays empty only for a little while and then a new business will come in
8501697 restaurants would do better but i think allowing sales by the drink could put us on a slippery slope
8501698 i see the potential for an increase in police calls
8501699 anyway many of us dont decide on where to go for dinner based on whether the restaurant serves alcohol
8501700 i personally think its too close to some residences and some commercial areas and they have a history of a spill
8501701 we feel fairly fortunate that our supplier did give us a bona fide bid
8501702 last year this particular area wasnt that bad we only had about three weeks of really bad weather the midwest however got hit hard
8501703 we are stuck between a rock and a hard place
8501704 its going to be a give and take this year
8501705 we will just have to be as conservative as we can on the flat streets while making sure our people are safe
8501706 were contemplating that as a decision we may have to make
8501707 its almost obscene compared to what these other communities are seeing
8501708 ive warned my municipalities and the board that this is something they have to plan for in the future
8501709 the impact is going to be felt on budgets deferred maintenance and maybe even tax increases
8501710 in general people in western pennsylvania are used to seeing black asphalt when it snows i think with these costs municipalities are going to have to start prioritizing and there has to be some understanding by the public
8501711 the days of seeing rock salt at 40 a ton are probably in the past
8501712 i like to donate the money because it will help make my brother happy
8501713 you can tell that raeann really loves and cares about her brother
8501714 shes constantly ahead of him knowing what he wants she is a kind hearted little girl
8501715 people know that the bracelets are for a good cause and they appeal to a lot of people who can personally relate to them
8501716 raeann can make them by request too and you usually have them the next day thats how quick she is
8501717 i have remembrance bracelets autism ones and i have bought birthstone bracelets for my daughters
8501718 there are even quite a few that i have given as gifts
8501719 its nice to have something like this all of her bracelets are displayed here with little cards saying what each bracelet is explaining the meanings of the colored beads

8501721 we both knew we wanted to do some film projects after school and decided that we were the perfect yin yang of powers he had cameras lights and the knowledge to use them and i wrote and performed
8501722 we wrote and filmed five sketches designed the site and went live its been about a year since then and were inching ever closer to breaking into film and television which is certainly where we want to be
8501723 david was the star and central premise of one of our best sketches chops
8501724 that one got us fourth place in sketchies ii a youtube sketch competition that had about a zillion people enter he shot for two days in a row almost non stop it was brutal and he did a phenomenal job
8501725 the safety of the nations food drug medical device and cosmetic supply in an increasingly globalized marketplace

8501729 unfortunately due to unforeseen technical difficulties we wont be able to release rushs
8501730 well be working on it as hard as we can but it looks like it could be a couple of weeks to fix in the meantime we will be moving around our schedule so we still have dlc coming out each week including this week info to follow in another announcement
8501731 look forward to some exciting news this weekend from pax and elsewhere
8501732 didnt even hit lvl 60 huh never been in a raid or had to keep track of your dkp huh

8501740 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8501741 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8501742 tainted leaders hoping to make a political comeback cannot expect to wipe the slate clean of their wrongdoings with mere apologies after committing an act that went against social and moral values
8501743 mobilising ghost writers for a massive attack on me would not cleanse ones misdeeds or change the norms this could be likened to ostriches burying their heads in the sand
8501744 my challenge to the endorsed candidate ong is for him to send a letter to umno repeating his statement that mca may pull out of bn if umno does not shed its ketuanan melayu policies
8501745 if he does not do any of these things then it would appear that he was just hoping to get political support to attain his ambition without actually intending to walk the talk
8501746 last week i openly pointed out that the mca must review its relationship with umno i pointed out that the perception of a master servant relationship should be removed
8501747 the candidate endorsed by the current party leadership ong now says the mca should consider leaving bn that was the logical conclusion of what i proposed
8501748 the morally tainted blogger dr chua was virtually concerned that the reports in the chinese dailies would not reach the umno top brass so he urged me to write to umno to state my stand
8501749 to me this is totally uncalled for as i always speak my mind freely and fearlessly without having to seek prior approval from any parties besides anybody in his right frame of mind will know that any statements made in any language in malaysia would readily be translated into other languages
8501750 likewise i also highlighted the issue about misappropriation of funds for repair works in two chinese primary schools in johor in 2006 where a rm30 000 contract ended up with only work worth rm3 000
8501751 recently during my rounds of visit to johor i was told much to my surprise and chagrin that the grassroots leader who reported the case to me had in fact been censured by an ex top leader in johor mca
8501752 mendis reminds me a bit of johnny gleeson though he releases the ball much quicker is taller and stronger he also has good change of pace
8501753 i dont know the reason whey they failed against mendis as far as warne was concerned over a period of time people read him more but warnes ability stood the test of time like any great batsman or bowlers its a testing time for him mendis his action has not been studied in detail by opposing batsmen not been exposed enough
8501754 then a call came and they asked for the meeting to be delayed they didnt say why but we can assume this is thailands business not ours
8501755 people in the camps are increasingly vulnerable to diarrhoea pneumonia and high fever because of water contamination and lack of proper clothing and sanitation
8501756 medical teams are spraying disinfectants in camps as unmanaged garbage is piling up in relief camps
8501757 efforts are being made to send more medical teams to the camps to avert possible epidemic
8501758 about 5 000 indian nationals entered nepal on wednesday seeking help and we estimate the number of indian nationals now seeking refuge in nepal to top 20 000
8501759 its a very exciting find because you rarely come across the bones in their original skeletal shape
8501760 we have found vertebrae ribs and a thigh bone of a very big adult dinosaur from the early cretaceous period
8501761 its also enormous we first found a femur thigh bone 1 80m long articulated with the hip then bigger and bigger ribs up to 2 40m
8501762 those from the early cretaceous period are much less common and one of this size is vary rare so we are able to advance our knowledge of the group in this period
8501763 we want to situate this dinosaur in the context of sauropod dinosaurs we have considerable hope that it may be a new species linked to the brachiosaurus and for which wed have to find a new name
8501764 as of now the consulate is looking after the survivors but soon they have to sort out their papers and take the first flight home about 42 workers have been given shelter at a labour accommodation located in al quoz we have also allocated some funds to them for their survival
8501765 may i speak to your manager you sound like youre incompetent
8501766 the failure of these committees to make the proper filing is not only a violation of the law but denies the citizens their ability to know who is contributing to addabbos campaign
8501767 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8501768 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8501769 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8501770 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8501771 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8501772 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8501773 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8501774 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8501775 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8501776 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8501777 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8501778 i dont really think about the record going into the games
8501779 i just try to remember what ive done to them in games past and how i got different guys out stick with the game plan and execute it until they try to do something else
8501780 you know hes going to pitch a good game and put up a lot of zeros
8501781 hes one of the premier pitchers in the league so i knew i couldnt make a mistake
8501782 roy and two big swings are all we needed tonight
8501783 i dont know if it was the first inning going a bunch of pitches right out of the chute
8501784 i kind of ran down a little bit i thought maybe i could get through the eighth but that was pushing it
8501785 maybe in new york i went out of the zone for some fastballs
8501786 but i feel just as good as i did the prior week
8501787 give him 10 more of them and he wont drop them
8501788 salty didnt take it for granted the ball was going to be caught it worked out well for us
8501789 thats what were taught since little league to hustle and run the ball out thats the fundamentals of baseball we were in a tight situation we needed a big hit i thought when he hit it that i had to run as hard as i can especially since im not in the lineup everyday i busted my fanny as hard as i could rounding third i saw him drop it and i thought they might throw me out at home then i saw catcher miguel olivo out there too and i knew i had it
8501790 obviously the error hurt but it shouldnt have been as close as it was either
8501791 a lot of that has to do with lack of run production when we should produce third inning runner on second nobody out and we dont get him over fourth inning runners on second and third with nobody out and we dont score a run out of that too
8501792 it should have been caught and you dont get a lot of practice at it it should have stuck in the glove and it didnt its kind of unexpected
8501793 if it were the new i phone coming out today that you wanted you wouldnt have been to busy i assure you
8501794 you only want a generator because your grandfather and your uncle and sister have one

8501811 didnt even hit lvl 60 huh never been in a raid or had to keep track of your dkp huh
8501812 im just looking at this season as my last year here
8501813 my head isnt thinking like im going to get fired if i lose
8501814 i do know i plan to go to phoenix after the season with kathy and take some time
8501815 we have a home there that weve never used much
8501816 its going to be harder for us but it is what it is
8501817 im figuring im starting the season without both of them and even if they do come around in september how sharp are they going to be having missed so much time this happened to us in 2005 when we went to the super bowl i didnt have darrell jackson for much of the season but guys like joe jurevicius and jerramy stevens stepped up
8501818 weve struggled at that position in recent years and engram has run a lot of tight end routes
8501819 i think our division has been getting better and we have been chipping away at some of our old talent
8501820 but we have a great home field advantage here because i know how tough it is for team to travel here

8501823 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8501824 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8501825 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8501826 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8501827 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8501828 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8501829 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8501830 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8501831 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8501832 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8501833 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8501834 we are delighted to welcome tristan davies to the sunday times as executive editor he will be helping us with design work and future developments on the paper as we prepare for the introduction of full colour presses
8501835 corinna honan a journalist with wide experience joins us as associate editor news review and will be assisting us on book serialisations and developing new ideas for news review
8501836 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8501837 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8501838 neuralnoise i didnt see him and i watched the whole thing
8501839 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8501840 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8501841 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8501842 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8501843 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8501844 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8501845 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8501846 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8501847 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8501848 the thing that upsets me is that we just moved in
8501849 why would you rent the apartment to someone if you knew you were having business difficulties our lease says that the only way he can evict us is on 30 days notice if he sells the property
8501850 weve been calling around but hes evicting so many people that 25 or 30 people have already called about anything that is available
8501851 the waiting list for accessible housing is very high but they will have someone helping them
8501852 im going to stay as long as i can stay
8501853 i pay for my electricity and have electric heat so i dont have to worry about that i dont know what ill do if they shut off the water
8501854 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8501855 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8501856 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8501857 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8501858 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8501859 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8501860 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8501861 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8501862 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8501863 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8501864 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8501865 pobre m xico nuestro tan cerca del f tbol y tan lejos de la ciencia
8501866 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8501867 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8501868 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8501869 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8501870 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8501871 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8501872 told us how he was going to work for redacted for 2 years retire a millionaire

8501874 nobody here saw a childhood we were always kept indoors but we dont believe that the solution is in the gun now we want to show the world that kashmiris deserve peace
8501875 india calls itself the worlds largest functioning democracy but if we are really a democracy cant we let people express their dissent
8501876 in every other part of the country police or army fire tear gas or rubber bullets during agitations why do they shoot first and ask questions later in kashmir
8501877 i have never met a japanese man who did not want me to be his mommy
8501878 this suggests that the decrease in fertility is due almost entirely to an increase in women of reproductive age not getting married and not having children
8501879 we need to organize our society so that women and families will be able to raise children while working
8501880 i think we still lack adequate efforts on that front
8501881 this means that mcmc is allowed to block any particular website which has committed acts that contravene the local laws of the country for example sedition
8501882 i will turn this into a big issue no doubt when it is known that the government has violated the charter msc will die i will personally see to it
8501883 i talk about it because our sense of pride gives hope for other individuals too that kind of hope and pride inspires other people into action
8501884 for those who do not want to have that dialogue i recognize that but for those of us who are proud of this moment we are not going to squash that
8501885 if she were alive she would be immensely proud of my being the first african american mayor of columbus
8501886 but she would not have even conceived of the possibility that a black man or woman a person of color could become president of these united states of america
8501887 you dont run from your roots you embrace your past and you represent everybody
8501888 i couldnt believe what i was seeing now for me to be here
8501889 but with older people theres no way if you were born in my time and world to think that you would see this happen
8501890 there were certain things we knew we couldnt do you could have the second best grades but you knew when you were pushing up to the line and crossing over it
8501891 there are some people here that are afraid this may in some way take away from their status but this is not a black thing or a white thing
8501892 there are some majority people who are afraid of that but if were not all rowing in the same rhythm were going to go in a circle
8501893 being an african american and not being sensitive to the historic nature of this is just a fallacy
8501894 ive always been involved in politics but i always had to settle for this is the first time in my adult life ive been really excited this is going to show that americas precepts are not just rhetoric
8501895 its not so much that hes black thats why it is historic but thats not why people are excited whats exciting is that he is transcending
8501896 embrace it sure its like the beautiful girl i cant reach but id love to embrace her
8501897 unless we give them a filibuster proof senate majority that can finally end the obstruction well never put this country back on track
8501898 once hes elected hes going to have to spend a whole lot of time with the speaker nancys influence is not going to be surpassed by any event or any person
8501899 i have in my brain an idea that democrats are going to be in the majority for a while so get used to it
8501900 it is going to be a time of positive constructive change
8501901 senator biden agreed that barack obama was unprepared to be president
8501902 i think hillary clinton called it naive senator biden called it irresponsible
8501903 what we dont know is if she thinks hes qualified to be commander in chief
8501904 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far dont you think
8501905 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8501906 i am here for everyone i grew up with in scranton and wilmington
8501907 i am here for the cops and firefighters the teachers and assembly line workers the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures
8501908 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8501909 folks remember when the world used to trust us when they looked to us for leadership with barack obama as our president theyll look to us again theyll trust us again and well be able to lead again
8501910 our position in the world has been weakened by too much unilateralism and too little cooperation
8501911 in some way the mccain people would love to see this as a repeat of reagan versus carter in 1980 where reagan got to run as the candidate of america and carter was the candidate of complexity and no answers
8501912 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union
8501913 another dishonest and desperate attack that bears zero relationship to reality
8501914 toxic and dangerous effects of a neocon unilateralist style that has nearly shattered our alliances and made americans weaker
8501915 i dont think it has the same resonance and intellectual honesty that it had in an earlier era
8501916 the public feels the republicans have been quite reckless on these things
8501917 you can talk all you want about policies and programs but thats not what people respond to
8501918 people respond when they are touched emotionally and thats what hes so good at its going to be very important in his speech tomorrow night that people get excited emotionally thats what they want from him
8501919 just stood passively at the side having lost early control of these games
8501920 a father knows hes a success when he turns and looks at his son or daughter and know that they turned out better than he did
8501921 champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8501922 joey its because youre so bright you cant get the thoughts out quickly enough
8501923 bloody their nose so you can walk down the street the next day
8501924 afghanistan we dont read about it anymore in papers because it succeeded
8501925 we need to send two more combat battalions to afghanistan
8501926 we must talk and make clear to iran that it must change
8501927 i was only 8 when my pal was trying to blow up the capital
8501928 there is going to be a lot going on this offseason i promise you that
8501929 whats happened has happened theres no use crying about it
8501930 well go to belgium next weekend i love that circuit id love to race there all year long
8501931 its the best of them all and i hope to have a good car there ill do my best to win if anybody doubts my motivation they can be sure of this i want to win now more than ever
8501932 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8501933 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8501934 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8501935 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8501936 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8501937 is an awful marriage of deals and death what was supposed to be a planning process was actually a huge planning black hole daniel libeskind s prize winning design a flexible schematic concept that established a framework of achievable creative possibilities has been progressively purged by political pandering and economic pragmatism
8501938 were unable or unwilling to differentiate between economically motivated development and long term urban goals nor was there any way they could control the 19 different government entities that a port authority report identified as independent agencies taking uncoordinated counterproductive actions
8501939 myth of an inclusionary process that goes beyond appropriate consideration of all relevant factors to the ridiculous denial of priorities
8501940 functioned particularly well as a device of the political evasion of difficult issues like whether the heart of manhattan should be a dead or living place dedicated to a dreadful past or a meaningful future what we got was an enormously overscaled memorial that overwhelms the site surrounded by the architectural tokenism of equally enormous name brand commercial buildings what disappeared
8501941 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8501942 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8501943 i think theres a lot of confusion about what architects do
8501944 its supposed to be about the health and safety and welfare of people and how well this building youre in your house or office or school helps you live or work or learn there
8501945 closed off by imposing stretches of black fence there was little access to public transportation and the zooming one way traffic on road arteries through the area made creating a neighborhood fabric literally hazardous
8501946 including innovative sidewalk plazas that opened up pockets of open space
8501947 with an elegance worthy of a high end design firm
8501948 basic human needs shelter sanitation and a safe place to seek work
8501949 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8501950 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8501951 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8501952 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8501953 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8501954 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8501955 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8501956 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8501957 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8501958 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8501959 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8501960 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8501961 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8501962 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8501963 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8501964 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8501965 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8501966 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8501967 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8501968 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8501969 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8501970 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8501971 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8501972 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8501973 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8501974 nenfreint pas les r gles imp ratives du droit international et doit donc tre soumise au peuple sans contre projet
8501975 aflphl588 cuts it to 588 with free shipping its 60 below last months mention and the lowest total price weve seen features include 1366 768 720p native resolution built in atsc hd and ntsc tuners 8ms response time one hdmi input and vga component and other video inputs
8501976 i think the conservatives are facing enough risks in this campaign because basically harpers putting his government on the line with no guarantee of success
8501977 a wild card thats not likely to play in his favour
8501978 whats occurred could lead to a broader discussion on governments role in these kind of things and its pretty clear that the harper government has more of a laissez faire self regulatory view on a lot of these issues
8501979 so it could leave the conservatives vulnerable if a narrative emerges that this is an example of what happens when you dont have actual government inspectors and you cant rely on an industry to police itself
8501980 governor governor wait here just a sec there is someone i want you to meet that person will run off and
8501981 this is 15 votes out of 90 plus thousand votes
8501982 it was so close 50 01 ladies gentlemen this is not right ive made a comment its been an interesting process thank you
8501983 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there amp and then will you please help take care of me
8501984 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8501985 this was a reasonable performance considering the challenging environment maybank president and chief executive officer datuk seri abdul wahid omar told a press conference yesterday
8501986 sorry i am unable to validate this document because on line 8 it contained one or more bytes that i cannot interpret as utf 8 in other words the bytes found are not valid values in the specified character encoding
8501987 its early in the campaign season and in the end the vote on this measure could be hard to predict
8501988 the burden is always on the yes side to convince people there is good reason to vote for the measure
8501989 das ist die zeit wenn risikopr mien von 10 bis 15 us dollar pro barrel gerechtfertigt sind
8501990 siemens unterst tzt die initiative die f r mehr klarheit bei den anteilseignern und der ffentlichkeit selbst sorgen soll

8501994 you mean this is what all that uproar was about
8501995 these are difficult days for all airlines theres no denying it
8501996 but american airlines unwillingness to come to even an interim agreement or agree to incentive pay for its ground workers while lining the pockets of executives is tearing a once proud airline apart
8501997 it is disappointing that the twu has taken this approach to the current contract negotiations
8501998 however we have made progress since opening talks in november and continue to meet regularly with the twu negotiating teams
8501999 we remain just as committed to working hard to reach an agreement
8502000 well do you want me to put this on hold
8502001 i thought you cant hold within 24 hrs of departure
8502002 security confiscated her medal in vancouver and everyone started to gather around it was surreal
8502003 do we treat teenagers like animals in heat or like people with a brain that have the ability to control themselves
8502004 we believe human beings can control their sexual desires and should be encouraged to
8502005 there has been a groundswell of opposition to these programs from states across the country and we thought we had put the issue to rest here in pennsylvania too
8502006 we are just trying to be fair across the board and make sure everyone has access to the funding they need
8502007 is being treated as a criminal investigation avalon is aggressively and immediately pursuing answers
8502008 we want to find out whos responsible for this act
8502009 authorities were fortunate to get some clues early in the investigation
8502010 but this wont take them to a specific office or individual like dr jones office in atlantic city
8502011 we cant comment on the source right now thats what were investigating
8502012 i think mayor pagliughi is probably right somebody came by and wanted to get rid of it medical waste
8502013 they knew it was illegal i cant imagine it was a mistake
8502014 i think it was done intentionally and when they find them i hope they stick it to them with a couple of their own needles throw the book at them
8502015 every shore community feels for avalon because someone might want to do it along their shore avalon is a great place with clean beaches
8502016 it could have fallen off a barge but it wouldve had to be really close to the shoreline barges are usually five to seven miles out
8502017 it would have to remain in a container or bag until broken apart by the wave action on the beach
8502018 someone could have taken a hike along the beach and gotten rid of the stuff in the middle of the night
8502019 we are carefully and continually monitoring the avalon beaches during this unfortunate event and will do everything we can to keep the beaches safe and open
8502020 its very fancy and the costs to maintain it would be astronomical
8502021 putting the fence around the park would close off the open space feel that was originally planned
8502022 we have sanitation surgery drainage plumbing every product of science and accessory of luxury it seems impossible to imagine any improvement on what we have

8502030 investigative reasons and also because of its poor quality the fact it only shows the man from behind and because the tonal quality of the black and white footage
8502031 the existence of the footage has never been a secret with it shown to 700 people during the exhaustive investigations to identify people inside and outside the hotel that evening supt byleveld said
8502032 police have been able to identify every one of the people in this vision except for this man
8502033 we would like this man or any person who recognises this man to come forward and contact crime stoppers on 1800 333 000 so that the special crime squad can complete this line of investigation
8502034 by voting they have ensured that tiger airways gives our customers the route network they want
8502035 traditionally many of the people of south australia who have wanted to join an airline as a flight attendant have had to pursue their career interstate due to limited opportunities

8502037 shut the f up current mood bullied i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction i was angry when i first read his attack on me but for me i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him i am not standing in his way i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is his need to throw a tantrum for the whole world to hear is i am not going to go into a play by play defense i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him p s im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living i am always will and always have been here for her for her not for anything else so i think its safe to say that there is not now and never will be a tell all written by me when does your book come out mr lohan
8502038 i am sick to death of all this remorse and rehabilitation get down to basics if you commit crime you get sentenced
8502039 if the legal profession has got this sort of person coming through the ranks god helps us in the future
8502040 she disarmed a police officer twice and put him in such a difficult situation that he had to use potentially deadly force

8502097 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8502098 i accept your nomination to run and serve alongside our next president of the united states of america barack obama
8502099 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can change the change everybody knows we need
8502100 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8502101 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8502102 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8502103 barack obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8502104 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making sen barack obama the next president of the united states
8502105 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house down last night
8502106 what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first thank you president clinton
8502107 its early in the campaign season and in the end the vote on this measure could be hard to predict
8502108 the burden is always on the yes side to convince people there is good reason to vote for the measure
8502109 lead to a stabilized inflation rate and that could help bring about stable economic growth in the medium and long term
8502110 unless a tighter policy is taken globally there remain upside risks to resource prices
8502111 it is desirable that the global economy should slow at a proper rate with resource prices being stabilized accordingly
8502112 i think michelle obama kicked it off pretty well dont you think

8502115 the whole biden family on this journey with me to take america back
8502116 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the effort to take america back
8502117 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8502118 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8502119 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8502120 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8502121 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8502122 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms

8502124 i dont know how i can live now because none of my family is left
8502125 there is a russia narrative that we were weak in the 90s but now we are back and we are not going to take it anymore but being angry and seeking revanchist victory is not the sign of a strong nation it is the sign of a weak one
8502126 russia is going to have to come to terms with the reality it can either integrate with the world or it can be a self isolated bully but it cant be both and thats a choice russia has to have
8502127 they are kind of giddy they will need to sober up
8502128 when they sober up they will see that it is not the u s that has done things to them its that they have done things to themselves
8502129 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel economic and political losses
8502130 no one asked what impact its actions had on the russian stock market there was no russian stock market
8502131 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8502132 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8502133 three american presidents bush clinton and bush have all in their own way sought to encourage russias integration with the wider world this is a good thing it was the right set of policies
8502134 russia has now put all of that at risk because russian cannot simultaneously behave like the soviet union toward its neighbors like this is 1968 and act as if it is 2008 when it comes to the wto
8502135 there are areas where we have common interest with russia and we want to work with them the question is whether russia has an ability to work with us
8502136 from time to time lawyers and judges have tried to define what constitutes fairness like defining an elephant it is not easy to do although fairness in practice has the elephantine quality of being easy to recognise as a result of these efforts a word in common usage has acquired the trappings of legalism acting fairly has become acting in accordance with the rules of natural justice and on occasion has been dressed up with latin tags this phrase in my opinion serves no useful purpose and in recent years it has encouraged lawyers to try to put those who hold inquiries into legal straitjackets for the purposes of my judgment i intend to ask myself this simple question did the decision maker act fairly towards the plaintiff

8502157 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion
8502158 it doesnt have the money and it is going to come out of schools transport and other infrastructure budgets or alternatively the state will start to go into dangerous levels of debt
8502159 the business community is not only dismayed that it has happened it is confused by how it has happened because anybody who understands government finances and the energy issue thinks there was no alternative to privatisation
8502160 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8502161 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw
8502162 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8502163 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8502164 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8502165 this was one way to provide the money to have reinvested in the states grid to provide certainty of supply

8502168 wurde es gerade in europa sehr fashionable von der multipolarit t zu plaudern also dem ende der amerikanischen vorherrschaft
8502169 liebe kollegen das war schon immer falsch weil die amerikaner nie aufh rten in ihrer eigenen liga zu spielen mit einer wirtschaftsleistung welche die des n chsten rivalen japans um das dreifache bertraf mit milit rausgaben die so gro waren wie die aller anderen l nder zusammen mit einer einzigartigen globalen pr senz und un bertroffenen machtprojektionsf higkeiten
8502170 die haben 2008 als supermacht der goldmedaillen den ersten rang besetzt sie prunkten auch mit 10 prozent wachstum aber ihre wirtschaft machte trotzdem nur ein sechstel der amerikanischen aus vier f nftel der bev lkerungs lebten in bitterster armut
8502171 das konnte man besonders gut an dem beispiel georgien beobachten schon in den jahren zuvor hatten die russen mit ihren pipelines massiven druck auf ihre westlichen nachbarn im postsowjetischen raum ausge bt sie hatten auch die zentralasiatischen ex republiken mehr oder weniger gef gig gemacht aber in georgien machten sie krieg zum ersten mal seit afghanistan 1979 unter fadenscheinigen gr nden sind sie einmarschiert haben das land portioniert und weite teile unter ihre herrschaft gezwungen
8502172 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8502173 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8502174 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8502175 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8502176 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8502186 realistically the locker rooms were not up to division one level
8502187 and for us to bring the tournament here they really needed to be and they made that commitment
8502188 all of the things we try to do we try to do first class without spending extra money
8502189 their commitment in wanting to make this a first class tournament is sincere and i feel that this could be a springboard for sioux falls
8502190 you put on a good division one mens and womens basketball tournament you can start getting leagues to bring other events into this area
8502191 its going to send a statement to those other schools coming to this tournament that south dakota really cares about the student athlete and really cares about them
8502192 we had to include a teacup tablescape as we have been enjoying tea parties with our girlfriends for years we have collected gorgeous vintage teacups teapots and plates from markets and second hand shops and from our grandmothers this tablescape is a reflection of great times shared together with good friends the coastal tablescape is a reflection of our queensland lifestyle we have shown a collection of things we love to use when styling queensland homes such as this beautiful cluster of hand blown glass tears recycled italian glass bottles and this gorgeous handmade antique copper tray which is covered in tin from syria the shells and the coral add a beautiful natural coastal element
8502193 to use a word that kids use its a ginormous project its a large project for a campus this size were doubling the size of our student union taking up a significant piece of our green space on campus its a very large undertaking for a campus this size
8502194 the big changes the big moving of offices and renovation at the existing building will occur late spring and next summer so it should not be too much disruption for students
8502195 i think that it will be worth it i think its a minimal inconvenience for how great and how rewarding its going to be in the end
8502196 its just a mess its just going to take a while to get rebuilt
8502197 still adding up you know working with the insurance companies but probably wont know for a while yet
8502198 theres nothing left of the corn you can see for yourself

8502200 i have nothing left to feed the milk cows and the beef cows i was going to use this for combining some fields i was going to chop the corn but i dont know if i can catch it now with the chopper even its so bad
8502201 boy i dont know corn prices are high youre going to have to really pencil everything down to make it work i guess
8502202 we could use our building yeah we sure could but were making due
8502203 you dont let it get you down and just get through it thats about all you can do

8502208 h tr s semanas ele chegou em casa todo sujo e contou que foi agarrado pelos colegas na hora do recreio jogado dentro do carro de lixo da escola e empurrado pelo p tio da escola segundo ele ningu m viu ou fez alguma coisa para tir lo da situa o no m nimo humilhante
8502209 achei um absurdo a afirma o dele sugerindo que um menino de oito anos j tinha uma op o sexual definida e que por isso ele teria problemas sa de l chocada
8502210 tamb m sou professora e trabalhei com educa o infantil em outra cidade at o ano passado nunca imaginei que isso poderia acontecer com o meu filho
8502211 recebi todo o apoio de que precisava espero incentivar outras m es a n o se conformar com as agress es
8502212 ele sempre foi um menino calmo amoroso e feliz depois disso ele parece querer se esconder das pessoas e evita entrar no banheiro da escola onde est estudando agora isso tudo porque uma vez os meninos da outra escola trancaram ele dentro do banheiro
8502213 ele foi ferido nas m os e na cabe a um dia ele me contou que os colegas haviam enfiado um l pis em uma das suas m os eu cheguei a ver as marcas e um peda o do l pis que eu mesma tive que retirar
8502214 o que mais me chocou foi saber que os professores e a dire o via isso tudo acontecendo e n o faziam nada o coordenador da escola disse que como fabiano ria e chorava enquando era agredido ele n o sabia se ele estava gostando ou n o
8502215 a decis o dessa m e em retirar o aluno da escola foi arbitr ria ela n o deu chance escola de acompanhar o problema a reclama o sequer chegou diretoria pois tudo estava sendo conduzido pelos coordenadores e pedagogos
8502216 em nenhuma das vezes foi dada a chance de a institui o acompanhar o caso
8502217 imediatamente a pedagoga os abordou e acabou com a brincadeira destacando que aquilo n o era adequado
8502218 os pais podem inclusive observar o recreio das crian as com mais de 300 alunos esse foi o nico caso que aconteceu at agora
8502219 it is a win win opportunity for both fujitsu india and tata elxsi i am sure both the companies will complement each other through this great association as the strength of tata elxsi is its capability to integrate business critical solutions and the fujitsu india is a great innovator of technology while tata elxsi would leverage on fujitsus brand equity technology leadership we would gain from their presence and experience in the automotive aerospace defence education amp research media amp entertainment and manufacturing verticals i am confident that this collaboration will create a high and positive business growth and customer satisfaction

8502224 it is difficult to see how the executive can demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on appeal or even that a serious legal question is presented
8502225 simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success or a substantial appellate issue

8502237 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so in between it signed a ceasefire agreement which included international mediation as the way forward if her word is not her bond then she will not be trusted by anyone russia needs to ask itself about the relationship between short term military victories and longer term economic prosperity
8502238 europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like russia
8502239 must not learn the wrong lessons from the georgia crisis there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity democratic governance and international law
8502240 russia is too enmeshed in the world economy it would be counterproductive
8502241 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8502242 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country

8502246 these projects are in various stages of development and we cannot stop them but will ensure they follow the rules
8502247 as the state government we need to be receptive to everyone just like developers need to listen to their customers who are the public
8502248 both sides have their point of view and we provided a forum where their concerns could be shared
8502249 he freed paedophile back home after a far east jail term staged a series of frantic gyrations when confronted on a secret night time trip to a luxury car showroom but he could not prevent us snapping him as he tried to conceal his identity beneath a straw hat sunglasses and a peculiar ginger wig
8502250 the effort is to have an agreement and to announce it on september 3
8502251 prudence would dictate that we leave the text as it is until our candidate catches up with us
8502252 i want to give him a platform he can run on
8502253 i dont want to stick my finger in his eye
8502254 force americans to sacrifice their way of life or trim their hopes and dreams for their children

8502256 filmmaking is a learning process you can either sit back and mope over failures or move on right now i am too fired up about aladdin to think about anything else
8502257 however it turns out and however you feel about his candidacy
8502258 about america finally beginning to come to grips with the complexity of the racial issues that have bedeviled us for so long
8502259 this is a huge step this is a generational step
8502260 the word history gets thrown around and its used rather loosely

8502276 i think theres a strong argument for saying that more of the training which occurs can be done in regional and country areas where theres less population and where there are valuable job opportunities
8502277 theoretically it should be impossible for two planes to collide so theres been obviously a failure a serious failure somewhere in the system but im advised that training there has been undertaken for many many years with a good safety record
8502278 i think one of the things that we would like to see over time is more of this sort of training undertaken in less densely populated areas and i suspect thats one of the things that may come out of the reports
8502279 its one of the busiest airports in australia i think there are something like 500 000 air movements there each year its also im advised one of the safest but obviously we want to ensure that the airports are as safe as possible
8502280 obviously yesterday was a tragic accident and tragic for the family concerned but it could have been worse we are grateful for the fact no schools or occupied houses were affected but we will look very closely at the report of the coroner and casa
8502281 investigative reasons and also because of its poor quality the fact it only shows the man from behind and because the tonal quality of the black and white footage
8502282 the existence of the footage has never been a secret with it shown to 700 people during the exhaustive investigations to identify people inside and outside the hotel that evening supt byleveld said
8502283 police have been able to identify every one of the people in this vision except for this man
8502284 we would like this man or any person who recognises this man to come forward and contact crime stoppers on 1800 333 000 so that the special crime squad can complete this line of investigation
8502285 im going to have some more tests when i get back to australia said the queenslander who will have his tonsils removed if necessary

8502295 we continued to invest in price and gave increased focus to promotions both of which helped to drive sales and win customers but as anticipated impacted margins
8502296 in europe as part of albert heijns price positioning strategy food price inflation was only partially passed on to customers during the quarter and strong promotions including the euro 2008 football championships temporarily impacted margins
8502297 in the united states the value improvement program has now expanded beyond price repositioning to marketing and branding
8502298 we are confident we will manage the balance between sales growth and margin and deliver our underlying retail operating margin guidance for 2008 of 4 8 5 3

8502314 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8502315 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8502316 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists

8502331 so also the tongue is a small member yet it boasts of great things how great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire and the tongue is a fire a world of unrighteousness the tongue is set among our members staining the whole body setting on fire the entire course of life and set on fire by hell for every kind of beast and bird of reptile and sea creature can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind but no human being can tame the tongue it is a restless evil full of deadly poison with it we bless our lord and father and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of god from the same mouth come blessing and cursing my brothers these things ought not to be so
8502332 let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor especially those who labor in preaching and teaching
8502333 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
8502334 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
8502335 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle

8502346 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just eight years old lets talk about standing up for america today
8502347 mccains consultants are going to go out and make ads that are misleading about barack obama we are going to make sure that they are answered we have to make sure that the truth is out there and that we are answering with force
8502348 its absurd and disingenuous for the obama campaign to say we are running this ad they are trying to blame us and use a straw man to take this issue off the table if he thinks having a relationship with an unrepentant terrorist is not an issue that concerns the american people he is deluding himself or being naive

8502356 mass media take a superpowers monologue into millions of homes we think of mass media as a fractured range oratory print radio television internet there is one common fact to this range the word the medium may be diverse but manipulation of the message is through the massage of words and the disorientation between text and context that is the key to mind management

8502362 this is a conspiracy involving certain individuals who made public statements to a worldwide magazine nature magazine through means that have falsely and maliciously defamed taleyarkhan and have sought to harass discriminate and intimidate taleyarkhan on numerous occasions for the purpose of trying him and important scientific research all with claims that have no merit

8502375 it was when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8502376 is just helping people get set up in the morning
8502377 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama i just liked how many people had their signs up
8502378 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8502379 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8502380 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8502381 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life
8502382 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8502383 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8502384 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8502385 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8502386 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8502387 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8502388 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8502389 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8502390 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8502391 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8502392 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8502393 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8502394 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8502395 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8502396 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8502397 she got us stuck on three different issues that we wanted no part of shes no master strategist no matter what she may believe you may see more of her but if her mouth is open what comes out wont be anything that our campaign wants anything to do with
8502398 she made a point that she was queen of the far left which was the group that really helped obama get to where he was
8502399 she didnt call herself a queen but you get the point and so did the obama people
8502400 she got us stuck on three different issues that we wanted no part of shes no master strategist no matter what she may believe you may see more of her but if her mouth is open what comes out wont be anything that our campaign wants anything to do with
8502401 she made a point that she was queen of the far left which was the group that really helped obama get to where he was
8502402 she didnt call herself a queen but you get the point and so did the obama people
8502403 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore americas leadership in the world
8502404 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8502405 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8502406 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8502407 man is a rational animal who always loses his temper when called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason
8502408 i once paraphrased mark twain on the senate floor there is no distinctly native american criminal class except congress

8502410 everyone helpin each other whenever they can we makin it happen from nothin to somethin
8502411 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8502412 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8502413 the big boost to infrastructure announced today reflects last years strong economic performance he said
8502414 the economic challenges were facing this year mean i can safely predict i wont make this kind of announcement 12 months from now
8502415 theres no doubt we can utilize it and it comes at a good time
8502416 we know at times the bar cars can be very crowded if we eliminate them we can allow people to get through to less crowded cars more easily some people avoid going into the bar car
8502417 i come to the bar car so i can be loud obnoxious and have a good time at the end of the workday
8502418 these people just want to be around people who are lively and not reliving the workday or dreading going home or whatever it is
8502419 some people go to happy hour we go to the bar car
8502420 were like family if somebody is gone for awhile you worry about them we have each others phone numbers
8502421 the car jams up all the time thats very dumb theyre hurting themselves
8502422 shouldnt happen here we shouldnt be putting up with it
8502423 one addict for every two hundred and fifty citizens this not only gives vancouver the highest rate of drug addiction in the western hemisphere
8502424 but means that if the citys rate of addiction continues to increase as at present the crop of addicts now being born will constitute one in every sixteen vancouverites
8502425 it is just as easy to buy drugs at this hotel
8502426 as it is for a child to buy candy at a store
8502427 through which the police could rush in to nab a suspect
8502428 the main street for drugs is still hastings at columbia
8502429 it never gets far from there between ourselves and the rcmp theres always someone watching it
8502430 when peoples budgets are tight thats when you see the amount they travel go down
8502431 people still want to do something but they dont want to spend as much
8502432 ive heard from some folks who believe there is price fixing and collusion going on and who want us to do a full blown investigation
8502433 but we arent going to do that the challenge is that we dont have subpoena powers
8502434 we must work at our responsibility as parents as if everything in life counted on it because in fact everything in life does count on it
8502435 well biden might have the experience and or the substance but we havent heard it from the man obama himself
8502436 things suck now so lets look at the bright and sunny future
8502437 as the world burns 50 simple things you can do to stay in denial
8502438 obama is klaar om president van de verenigde staten te worden
8502439 alles wat ik in acht jaar presidentschap en daarna heb geleerd in de vs en elders in de wereld overtuigt mij ervan dat barack obama de man is voor deze job
8502440 hillary heeft ons gezegd dat ze alles zal doen wat ze kan om te bereiken dat barack obama wordt verkozen met mij erbij zijn dat er twee
8502441 en met jullie erbij zijn dat er 18 miljoen net als hillary wil ik dat jullie die haar hebben gesteund in november voor barack obama kiezen
8502442 die ons herinnert aan hoe het is om een president te hebben die mensen echt op de eerste plaats zet
8502443 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8502444 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8502445 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8502446 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8502447 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8502448 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8502449 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8502450 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8502451 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8502452 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8502453 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8502454 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8502455 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8502456 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8502457 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8502458 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8502459 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8502460 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8502461 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8502462 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8502463 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8502464 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8502465 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8502466 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8502467 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8502468 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8502469 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8502470 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8502471 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8502472 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8502473 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8502474 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8502475 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8502476 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8502477 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8502478 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8502479 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8502480 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8502481 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8502482 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8502483 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8502484 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8502485 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8502486 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8502487 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8502488 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8502489 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8502490 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8502491 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8502492 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8502493 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8502494 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8502495 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8502496 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8502497 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8502498 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8502499 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8502500 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8502501 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8502502 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8502503 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8502504 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8502505 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky

8502545 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects

8502547 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8502548 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8502549 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true

8502610 our country is less secure and more isolated than in any time in recent history
8502611 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a few deep holes with very few friends to help us climb out
8502612 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8502613 i move that sen barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states

8502615 we all know that he wants to be loved just call him call him any time of day or night
8502616 talk to him about anything talk to him about the olympics or what he thinks about a certain congressional district or even about the new york times sunday crossword puzzle obama could even put the phone in a drawer and just let president clinton talk away it wouldnt take much it could be so easy
8502617 he said i hate that phrase anyway it makes it sound like a game playing a card when race is not a game and never was it is deadly serious
8502618 i could see that clinton might have endorsed him obama has a lot of attributes he values
8502619 one difference between the two guys is that obama never had an uncle buddy who lived in a trailer

8502634 emin has turned her life into a public spectacle like no other artist before her
8502635 by the end of this show i felt as if someone had been shouting at me down the phone for a couple of hours a kind of emotional earache
8502636 what distresses me far more than emins taste for the obscene is her amazing unshakable faith in her own importance
8502637 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8502638 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8502639 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8502640 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8502641 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8502642 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8502643 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8502644 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8502645 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8502646 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8502647 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8502648 the family has all agreed to receive him at a domestic airport

8502657 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery as this is the paramount consideration at this point in time
8502658 she has expressed some disappointment in the number of inaccuracies contained in much of the media coverage of the incident
8502659 however under legal advice she has not yet released her statement of events
8502660 she does request that the media and others respect her privacy and that of her family during this difficult period
8502661 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8502662 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

8502668 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8502669 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8502670 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8502671 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8502672 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8502673 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8502674 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8502675 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8502676 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8502677 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8502678 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view

8502680 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8502681 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8502682 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8502683 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8502684 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8502685 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8502686 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8502687 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8502688 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8502689 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8502690 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8502691 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8502692 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8502693 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8502694 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8502695 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8502696 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8502697 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8502698 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8502699 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8502700 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8502701 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8502702 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8502703 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8502704 you know how milwaukee painting contractors know how to manipulate the well tempered clavichord milwaukee painting contractors only thought in the lower school is a lull took place and consociateth the most conscientious patience and loyalty three quarters of a flood of the envelope but was caught and impaled by the sword or cheaper to die milwaukee painting contractors wanted milwaukee painting contractors to write with planchette what business has a plan to sir thomas bluther victualler and many other things from the train when milwaukee painting contractors got to stop

8502719 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8502720 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8502721 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8502722 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8502723 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8502724 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not

8502727 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8502728 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8502729 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8502730 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8502731 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8502732 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8502733 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8502734 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8502735 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention

8502764 i played good for the first round because im always nervous and my confidence is not so great just in the beginning of tournaments
8502765 we had a plan of what we wanted to do we toughed it out and our side came through and we sailed a clean race today it was nice for us to make it stick there have been times in the past where we have been in the lead in the past and worked our way back into the pack today was nice and everyone did a nice job we are a bit more relaxed we have been working very hard on some downwind techniques to get a bit more speed just learning a bit more each time it has taken a bit of while to get one on the board but it is important to feel that we can win paul has had some more time on the boat and things are going well
8502766 we are really liking it here the conditions are interesting challenging and different and it is a nice city
8502767 it was interesting today because the breeze was shifting and you really needed to stay in phase with it and if you were allowed to do that you did well there was a very definite pattern to it and staying in phase was the name of the game
8502768 in general we have been going well since cagliari but just needed to cut out the stupidmistakes and i think we did that today
8502769 i think the superstition came true again after winning the practice race as today we won the first regatta and had a good start to the last one but after just a quarter of the first beat we broke the head stay and had to retire a little luck with no third race means we only lose one and i think we can make repairs rapidly to be back in it again tomorrow we are obviously keen to get good results here it is very bad luck to break a piece which is hard to check it either hold or it breaks but these pieces should be solid enough on an offshore boat

8502775 we must fix this credit market amp we must keep americans in their home

8502885 it looks like washington county in fact as a school system will make ayp
8502886 but any time weve got a kid that doesnt pass the sols standards of learning im not happy about it so that means weve got more work to do
8502887 i really think when you meet 28 out of 29 benchmarks how much closer can you get thats really good so were proud of it and were going to move forward
8502888 we increased our percentage in so many areas im very pleased with the results and i think the people in bristol should be pleased
8502889 percentages and test scores do not tell the whole story
8502890 just because somebody passes an sol doesnt assure me that they know what they need to
8502891 and were going to focus on developing a curriculum that elevates them above the sols
8502892 she still had the courage to communicate and said she didnt want to go on like that
8502893 she would never have liked that no athlete would like to have a life with only their eyes talking
8502894 we are in the mix and this team has been working to make the playoffs so we are hoping we can make that final push and be in the postseason
8502895 all of these losses on the road have been winnable games
8502896 we have struggled to play well down the stretch and every player on this team is tired of losing on the road i think we are going to be able to turn that around
8502897 all seven teams right now in the western conference have a legitimate shot and a strong chance to work themselves into the race
8502898 its interesting if you see the matchups and how one game even one you arent involved in can impact how you play matchups and tiebreakers could play a big impact in the placement of teams
8502899 making the playoffs is a very doable goal right now and we intend to get there
8502900 when the break came we were playing our best basketball of the season and we just have to pick that right back up
8502901 all we can do is think about basketball and go out there and try win games and extend this season

8502910 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8502911 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8502912 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8502913 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8502914 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8502915 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8502916 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8502917 at least he proved that not all asian men are small

8502922 oh it sounds like osama bin laden so im not voting for them
8502923 we voted at a previous council meeting to accept the gift back from the school board with the one stipulation that we keep the buildings name
8502924 after the school board discussed the issue they voted to impose a second stipulation for the city to use it for educational purposes
8502925 if they want to give it to use as a gift we ought to receive it with one stipulation attached to it
8502926 we dont want to tie any action we might make in the future
8502927 the stipulation ties our hands and the hands of future elected officials and the city for that matter
8502928 this is a startling amount of change in a major area of peoples lives over a very short period
8502929 many of the changes that are being proposed are designed to strengthen the citys position with requirements for future developments and to assist the city with enforcement issues
8502930 for the white out what they want to do is for all the fans to wear white to the games
8502931 were just real excited about the season and the opportunity to play the first game its going to be huge game and were asking people to come out in mass
8502932 theyve always been very vocal and obviously we want a lot more when we come to the game to be able to pump our kids up and fill that stadium
8502933 it still goes against your record even if its not a region loss
8502934 were always looking for opportunities for kids to show their art
8502935 my short game was phenomenal i was trying to keep it in the fairway i had 27 putts today and that was what enabled me to win
8502936 to be honest we finished a lot stronger than i thought we would
8502937 the improvement from the season opening tournament at larkin to today was outstanding its always nice to have the individual champion
8502938 i think we really look at it one game at a time and one practice at a time
8502939 do you get better whether you win or lose a game the goal is still the same next week to get better i think the streak is the furthest thing from their minds we keep them busy enough that it shouldnt be a big deal
8502940 we expect them to execute what theyre capable of executing
8502941 oftentimes an athletes lack of execution is technique and footwork every kid should know where to go on certain plays and they should be able to recognize the technique thats used if we happen to be good enough well win the games those are the things we can control knowing where to go and how to get there after that you have to be able to play
8502942 i think the valley side is going to be very very balanced
8502943 i think everyone is going to be solid obviously carys number one i think were all going to be very competitive then if somebody can knock off cary grove who knows lets hope its us theyve got it going right now
8502944 we have five other good teams to play in the division and we think all of them are going to be pretty solid
8502945 weve got our secondary back on defense otherwise were unproven
8502946 with the returners we have i think our defense is going to be pretty strong
8502947 im looking for them to step up weve got the talent and experience to do that
8502948 i think until someone beats us id like to think were the favorite
8502949 johnsburg is going to be tough and you have to look out for crystal lake central and huntley we could have quite a battle on our hands
8502950 we believe our improvement in the passing department will pay big dividends
8502951 i think were going to be more competitive this year
8502952 i think well be able to throw the ball better and run the ball better this year
8502953 weve got some pretty good juniors coming up along with a lot of experienced seniors
8502954 if we play defense like we need to and our offense comes around i think weve got a nice mix of players i think we can be competitive
8502955 we will be a far better team than we were last year
8502956 weve never done the increased kind of off season work like weve done were a heck of a lot better than last year what that translates into i dont know because were in a pretty good conference
8502957 even last year we were so much better than we were the year before
8502958 we won only one game but we had some injuries that kind of hurt us in that category just overall competitiveness was much better than the year before were just looking to build on that
8502959 geneva had something very big when i first came here that money cant buy and that was tradition
8502960 i remember hearing lloyd carr when he took over as coach at michigan tell a group of people that the first thing he would ask for to start a program was tradition
8502961 even though geneva was struggling at the time the late 1990s i knew it had a solid tradition
8502962 the tradition was because of auchstetter and larry davis and many others
8502963 i knew geneva had been losing for a while when i came but i knew the tradition was there so i started talking to anyone in the community i could who knew about this tradition and i talked to jerry auchstetter a lot
8502964 the program had just faded and it was hard to put your finger on it as to why
8502965 but it almost seemed like the kids stopped believing that they could win and its really hard to get kids to get out there and believe
8502966 i told rob that he had to get the players to believe they could win
8502967 he conquered it and now the program is very respectable again
8502968 in addition to tradition the other key ingredient is lifting weights and working hard in the offseason
8502969 that 5 4 team was one of the first to really take that to heart and that was the first group that was with the weight program as eighth graders and through high school
8502970 its not that the other teams and other guys i had were not committed before the 2003 season
8502971 it was just that we didnt have them long enough to really build into the program
8502972 those earlier teams fought through more adversity than many of the other teams
8502973 those were all great teams and if there were state playoffs at that time who knows we may have won some state championships
8502974 we went undefeated that season and got to the semifinals against a tough lisle team but the weather got terrible and it rained and our team was built on quickness and speed
8502975 the weather just took that away and we lost to a tough team
8502976 i just had a lot of good high school football players and i had a great staff of jerry vitton john barton charles bell jim burger and others
8502977 i wasnt against soccer because i would never be against a sport that kids enjoyed but i was concerned that we had this tough football schedule and we were a small school of only 750 students
8502978 so if we took on boys soccer we would be the smallest school in illinois at that time to offer both sports i just felt we shouldnt do it until we were over 1 000 kids
8502979 really i dont think that it had a big effect on the football program faltering all those years
8502980 i remember i was in the hallway at school looking at some old equipment and thinking i just had nothing going yet and a fellow from the community mark pheanis just walked up and said he wanted to help
8502981 i said sure and mark has been a great help ever since
8502982 you never know what happens on a friday night under the lights
8502983 but we have a lot of our defense coming back and some pretty solid options on offense and i think we should be ok
8502984 when my mother was pregnant with me she told me later a party of hooded ku klux klan riders galloped up to our home in omaha nebraska one night surrounding the house brandishing their shotguns and rifles they shouted for my father to come out still shouting threats the klansmen finally spurred their horses and galloped around the house shattering every window pane with their gun butts
8502985 rep pelosi no it isnt but you could again you could reduce the price at the pump immediately with unintelligible you can have a transition with natural gas you can have a transition with natural gas that that is cheap abundant and clean compared to fossil fuels so so there is a way to transition this instead of doing more of the same the bush administration two oil men in the white house they want us to believe that the status quo is what we should do and more of it and more of it when it will just only keep us in the same place that we are now
8502986 we cant go out there and steal all the football championship subdivision schools kids that we just found out about
8502987 talking about different aspects of spring ball whats coming up this summer just to say hey
8502988 theyve got a few more is and ts that theyve got to dot and cross
8502989 were keeping touch because you can get cold feet here
8502990 going to the university of georgia on a full academic scholarship may look better than going to boot camp in the summer
8502991 let me ask you one question if you were in a vehicle and you traveling at the speed of light and then you turned your lights on would they do anything
8502992 the acquisition of postpath complements our strategy to develop an integrated collaboration platform designed for how we work today and into the future providing real productivity gains and a more satisfying user experience
8502993 our cloud based delivery model offers our customers rapid deployment and compelling economics
8502994 this agreement is another great example of how industry leaders are coming together to collaborate through intellectual property licensing and by doing so enabling innovation that will ultimately benefit the consumer
8502995 we are proud of the quality of our broad global patent portfolio and we are pleased to be working with an industry leader such as nikon
8502996 wise men talk because they have something to say fools because they have to say something

8503007 just coming so close to beating some of the best teams in the nation it still hurts to this day
8503008 so im going to play that much harder i think our whole team will too
8503009 one extra play just make one more play to ensure those wins i dont want to feel nothing like that again so im sure were going to be hungry going into those last minutes
8503010 thats an area we have to address because of the results of the season
8503011 our mat drills were harder and our camp was harder than it has been in the last few years
8503012 everybody is in better shape and i think theyve worked harder than they have in the recent past thats going to help a lot in the third and fourth quarters
8503013 we hadnt been in those situations before in the previous years
8503014 its hard when you dont start on teams that have had success its hard to know how to finish a game
8503015 it is just the confidence we have in ourselves and knowing that it wasnt a fluke that we had played with those teams in the first half it is just our mental toughness to say you know what we are good enough to be here we shouldnt be surprised to be here we should expect to be in this situation and take advantage of it
8503016 there are more and more guys weve recruited that come from winning programs theyre used to winning
8503017 the young guys that are forced to play young maybe theyll bring what they learned in high school from their winning programs to the college level
8503018 this years team weve been working really hard to finish things the upperclassmen just want us to finish everything
8503019 toward the end of practices thats when they want us to work harder
8503020 the coaching standpoint will probably show up more on game day we must make sure were doing a better job of analyzing our opponent and know our kids and also put them in the right places
8503021 its not anything out of the ordinary to get that done
8503022 its not me that made myself hate them niggers its the niggers that made me hate them
8503023 im only bringing 3 cigarettes so the niggas wont be on me
8503024 ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
8503025 it was a lot of hard work to get it
8503026 i had about 6 inches to get the shot off there were a number of white shirts lions around me i actually had a little bit of space and saw an opening in the right side netting
8503027 were a good team and work the ball well together
8503028 we just see each other and really dont have to talk that much were just a good team
8503029 weve got good team speed and played much better in the second half
8503030 our effort was much better overall we played well together and the tactical stuff was a part of it it was a good effort and were working well as a team i think they were playing for each other
8503031 i thought we ran the show for about 50 minutes after lake zurich scored the first goal
8503032 when lake zurich scored the second goal we put our heads down we had no one to step up and say relax and start a comeback we just need to take our time and play the same way we need to let the ball do the work the next goal came and it was like it was all over
8503033 lake zurich is a nice team but we didnt have our composure in the middle and we need to put things together we should be fine lake zurich told us what we need to work on
8503034 i think joliet catholic youve always got to stay with them
8503035 their school is a football school i actually believe their school would close its doors if it wasnt for football
8503036 as i say every year its joliet catholic until somebody knocks them off
8503037 its probably the most unique situation ive been in but it will be a good experience for us
8503038 were still very excited and coming out people dont think well be very good so we have nothing to lose
8503039 this transaction if its successful will take the pressure off them
8503040 ive been with the fair since before i was born
8503041 many people like to paint the fair industry as a declining one
8503042 we dont have our grandkids around its a fun place to be
8503043 the state fair has always been here and a lot more people live in eastern nebraska i dont think people will travel that far
8503044 is aching and longing for a love lost a deep feeling of melancholy
8503045 youre all important enough that we want you to come
8503046 for their thoughts regarding development approaches we might take for the innovation campus
8503047 the information we received from these rfis should give us enough information to help us focus on what we want to include in our formal request that we will issue this fall
8503048 a lot of things have opportunity thats why we did this rfi
8503049 first we have to see what we have and then follow through to the next steps
8503050 follow up conversations with those who submitted information packets is where its headed the first job is to see what the experience level is and who is interested in partnering with the university
8503051 nebraska innovation campus is an opportunity for businesses to locate to lincoln
8503052 businesses which can establish close working ties with the university so that we have opportunities for collaborative research and opportunities for our students to have work experiences and internships
8503053 when you walk into abel it doesnt feel like a place where you are just passing through to your room it feels more like a home
8503054 so far in my classes everything is on blackboard nothing has been a hard copy
8503055 every textbook i get has a cd that links up with the web
8503056 our challenge is to figure out how to use digital tools effectively
8503057 how to use them in a way that is meaningful
8503058 when i was growing up it was an encyclopedia you went to for knowledge now that you have a computer at home you go online for that kind of research
8503059 ive had students in my course reviews comment on how much they appreciate that i do a lot of things on blackboard
8503060 i post my syllabus course documents and links to online sources
8503061 we are very pleased that a record number of students are taking the sat and that minority student participation continues to remain high
8503062 this is significant because when more students take a test the average score tends to dip slightly despite the growth in test takers the scores remained steady

8503087 about time this was a long one jags need this rookie to step up big time
8503088 i think its something that all of us kind of enjoy
8503089 obviously its easier to win but i think any time you are able to come into a situation like this and be a part of the team that helped turned it around and get you back to where you were its exciting its something that people talk about for a long time and youre part of history and thats something to be proud of
8503090 the chance to play d i football for the uw was the goal
8503091 the goal was not to be recognized when he goes into downtown seattle the goal was to play on the ball team win ball games and hopefully have a successful career hes not a quick fix guy either and hes not afraid to do the work to make something right and he came in knowing that right now they were in a rebuild time
8503092 its amazing to think about a guy whos only going into his sophomore season and not only does he encompass this program but the spread offense
8503093 from a national perspective i think there are a lot of people that question until you see it how good his supporting cast is and he is going to have to carry the burden and do everything and i think at times last year he felt that
8503094 i know i am not alone on the field its going to take a joint effort to get where we want to go to be totally honest i dont believe that one man stuff i love when people say that because we do have a lot of other talent
8503095 if they are worried about only me thats great if thats all they are focused on then more power to them
8503096 it just seems like he doesnt get big headed at all he handles it a lot better than i would since the day he stepped on the field i knew he was a talented guy no doubt about it
8503097 ill do whatever i feel gives us the best chance to win and gives our team the best chance to have success
8503098 i felt like theres a great tradition here obviously we got away from it for a couple of years but it was something that i was interested in being involved in the restoration of that thats something i thought i would be neat a cool experience i think its a great place to play college football
8503099 i love watching the 90s defenses pretty much any old huskies game on youtube ive watched it a million times gosh
8503100 those games were insane the way the defense attacked those guys played so hard
8503101 thats why you come to the university of washington no one comes here thinking youll lose this program was built on winning and great teams
8503102 it makes you so angry youre not playing like that
8503103 i know what we are were here and theres this where they were and thats what fans in washington are used to seeing and thats our full intent to get back and to give them what they want but its not a switch you can just turn on
8503104 if we play with more confidence i think we can begin to bridge that gap we need to play harder
8503105 they come into it very fresh they come into it very aggressive and competitive
8503106 i always went into the games thinking we were going to kick the crap out of them
8503107 of course daniel watches those old tapes hes got a passion for husky football all the guys see that
8503108 he makes it fun for us makes it easier to understand things
8503109 if we do something wrong hell stop the drill and show us exactly what he wants instead of telling us its a different approach
8503110 i think its coming along actually i think we over communicate right now its good to do that though
8503111 the thing ive been delighted about with our defense is theres a level of communication going that i think we stepped up i think our guys will play with some passion some energy
8503112 do not go gentle into that good night blog blog against the dying of the light

8503117 isa sa ginagawa namin ay pinapaalam sa kanila na narito ang pnp at afp armed forces of the philippines na katulong ng mga local chief executives para protektahan ang kanilang mga barangay one of the things were doing right now is telling them that the pnp and afp are here helping the local chief executives in protecting their villages
8503118 vigilantes and the indiscriminate arming of civilians are not allowed
8503119 ive done three films with them and they call it my trilogy of idiots
8503120 after reading the part which they said was hand written for myself i was not sure if i should be flattered or insulted
8503121 by the way im starting to detect something in the crowd here a feeling that you all feel theres something wrong with being an idiot i just want to caution you about that because thats a sensitive subject and a big demographic
8503122 there is the time for everything timing is everything and this is the time to finally speak up
8503123 you just got to approach it like you would if you were starting and thats really all you can do
8503124 crazy things can happen and you get put in there so you got to keep working keep focusing keep paying attention in meetings and just doing all the things that youve been doing
8503125 hes going to be a really fine player and im excited about his talent i really am
8503126 i think hell be very competitive in our quarterback situation in the future
8503127 i think if i wasnt playing a sport that i definitely wouldnt be here or manage my time nearly as well
8503128 im definitely getting a lot more done as an athlete because i have less time
8503129 obviously im going to have a lot more independence in college but ill have a lot more on my shoulders by going to class and writing my papers
8503130 i asked her if i can get him to apologize would that be ok
8503131 thats one thing i like about this football team is weve got good leadership we have good senior leadership the unity council is stepping to the forefront its a good thing from my standpoint i feel good theyve taken great ownership of the program
8503132 unfortunately you get to the opening week of the season and theres a lot of high school coaches and teams that are just starting
8503133 you come off of the summer and a lot of these guys have been taking unofficial trips and been traveling around and their coaches really want them to concentrate on what they have
8503134 i think this game is more important than most home openers because its hopefully going to be that game that puts us back on our right path
8503135 its one thing to have a bad start to a season but you dont want to come down to feeling so bad about yourself that youre not able to perform in the second game
8503136 the team sets their own standard on how they want to compete especially on their home field
8503137 the mentality to want to protect your home field you want that established in the very first game
8503138 if race relations keep improving like this i may have to get a real job
8503139 we became a little suspicious of the intentions behind the games when the latest brain buffet was announced for release
8503140 our investigations revealed that the publishers of the games were just front companies for the zombie horde
8503141 theres little evidence that exercising the brain with video games will make it physically larger its shoddy work by the zombies but its what weve come to expect from them
8503142 well we like to encourage students to do more enriching activities and these brain games certainly qualify but if theyre just getting fattened up for the upcoming zombie apocalypse maybe we should rethink our support
8503143 if they asked me id say spend your time in ohio or some of these other states where its going to be very close
8503144 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8503145 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8503146 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8503147 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8503148 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8503149 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
8503150 we feel that it is a wake up call to companies that have web sites that are selling goods and services
8503151 they need to pay attention to accessibility it is the right thing to do
8503152 as the companys online business has evolved we have made significant enhancements in order to provide an accessible shopping experience
8503153 we are hopeful that we can resolve issues without litigation
8503154 technology for the web sites overall is still developing and there would need to be some flexibility in those standards
8503155 standards should not be dictated by any particular individual it needs to be a collaborative process
8503156 things arent great between them its hard because hes filming in new mexico and shes in los angeles the relationship is strained and their wedding wont happen anytime soon
8503157 from this day on im just not gonna worry about this
8503158 weve gone down to the smallest galaxies we can see
8503159 whats surprising is theres so much dark matter even though these guys are little they barely have a few thousand stars
8503160 basically galaxies like our own wouldnt have formed if we didnt have dark matter
8503161 close your eyes and dont move or ill spank you
8503162 you must be the change you want to see in the world
8503163 i want to change the regime by nonviolence that person must also be nonviolent
8503164 i understand violence as the avoidable impairment of fundamental human needs or to put it in more general terms the impairment of human life which lowers the actual degree to which someone is able to meet their needs below that which would otherwise be possible the threat of violence is also violence
8503165 who you call who you call tell me who you talk to
8503166 short person tugging my on apron strings and trying to kill me
8503167 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
8503168 i dont feel they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
8503169 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
8503170 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
8503171 if theres no mess those people can be very dangerous
8503172 not every environment makes an employee feel empowered to ask for things like raises
8503173 in cases where the murderer intentionally makes an action which is inherently lethal even if the murderer does not intend to kill the person
8503174 quiero invitar a mis colegas de gobierno al se or presidente a que saquen una bandera blanca a que en un momento donde nos acusan de cosas injustas lo aceptemos por la dignidad del cargo manejemos la situaci n con concordia y demos el ejemplo que el 80 por ciento de los colombianos respaldan
8503175 a los colegas del gabinete los invito a que demos un paso atr s y busquemos el escenario de concordia de discusi n
8503176 we have so many guys who can play both ways its fantastic
8503177 i have never been a big fan of changing our style of play for the opponent so now we can just change the lineup as far as who is playing where and adjust to the other team this is the most versatile team we have had at fox chapel
8503178 definitely our versatility is going to be our strength followed closely by the fact that fox chapel has always had a very organized defense
8503179 the kids are very strict in the system of play and that has served us well in the past
8503180 all three goalies did well last year and lucas had very good practices and then went out and shut out gateway in a very heated section game and kind of made the position his own at that point
8503181 i think we will have a lot more scoring power this year than we have had in the past
8503182 we have more forwards and who plays will depend on who has the hot foot it is a nice problem for a coach to have having too many guys who can put the ball in the net
8503183 weve always had tough hard nosed hard hitting football games against them
8503184 we definitely have been rivals seems like every time we play them its a good game
8503185 the important thing is when you play a good team you use it as a measuring stick for where you are
8503186 these first four non conference games you want to come out of them healthy and you want to play well you want to see yourself progress from week one to week two and so on youre looking to play better every week and go from there sure wed like to win them but the most important thing is preparing for the conference
8503187 were still experimenting with kids moving kids around trying to get the right chemistry
8503188 we really need to play a meaningful game to see where we are we have some veterans back and were counting on those kids to lead us
8503189 they look to be in midseason form already based on what ive seen from two scrimmage films
8503190 any time you have that many seniors and a veteran team coming back youll be pretty good
8503191 theyre real aggressive and have some offensive weapons and do some things differently than theyve done in the past with the amount of throwing the ball
8503192 jock had eyes in the back of his head we practiced in groups and he made all the rounds he knew what was going on
8503193 jock would say when you throw the ball you scruff your ear
8503194 vince dennery scooped up the ball and ran 99 yards for a touchdown
8503195 i will not comment on charles bowser except to say he was no jock sutherland
8503196 marshall goldberg got hurt in the first quarter against carnegie tech
8503197 it was a big disappointment if i remember correctly we returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown
8503198 i dont have a real answer why but there was a big rivalry between the two schools and then came carnegie tech and duquesne
8503199 larry peace had a fumble that was returned for a touchdown he was a substitute for goldberg but duke did not have a first down at all
8503200 john bowman the chancellor at pitt said you had to maintain a c average to play we lost five or six good players that way
8503201 id heard jock gave them 5 out of his own pocket and the losing team got more from the school
8503202 sutherland would fill up a five gallon milk can with water and put oats in it you drew water out of it with a sponge if you wanted a drink or to wipe your face so nobody drank any water
8503203 we had a short right field and a long left and center field
8503204 right field must have been about 200 feet away from home plate the rule was if you hit it into the stands it was a double if you hit in left or center and it went by the outfielders it was a sure home run
8503205 baseball was my first love i could have signed with detroit or the philadelphia phillies but i was drafted into world war ii
8503206 what helped me was football because all the hospital purchasing agents knew me
8503207 im still thankful to be here im a very happy man
8503208 i cant wait to have a baby i can wait but you know i cant wait
8503209 we want to open up the convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party

8503219 patriotism and i will include here racial politics is the last refuge of the scoundrel
8503220 malaysia has been stuck with an obsolete economic programme which has led to the loss of competitiveness the diminishing attractiveness of the nation for foreign investments which is further worsened by the lack of transparency accountability and good governance
8503221 is to embark on a new malaysian economic agenda based on market economic principles and driven by malaysians working together to enhance economic competitiveness all malaysians
8503222 must play a part and be part of this new direction
8503223 we need to promote growth and that can only happen if we are seen to be a market driven economy
8503224 market growth is not a zero sum game at the expense of the poor and the marginalized but instead of a race based affirmative action policy what we should have is a needs based policy in doing so the majority of the malays will still be taken care of and at the same time so too would the needy and marginalized among the other communities in the country such as the indian estate workers
8503225 come hand in hand with good governance the rule of law and a free media i do not believe that such an agenda is the concern of the present ruling establishment although there have sometimes been some platitudes towards that direction from the establishment
8503226 transform the nation and at the same time ensure that the transition is smooth and stable so as to garner hope for all malaysians
8503227 patriotism and i will include here racial politics is the last refuge of the scoundrel
8503228 i am a malay a very committed and concerned malay but i cannot see my relevance if i cannot think as a true malaysian and show enough concern for the welfare of all malaysians
8503229 i am convinced that pursuing an obsolete agenda including race based politics will ultimately lead not just to a breakdown of the social fabric but will adversely affect the morale confidence and resolve of the malays
8503230 how many non bumiputra can understand and appreciate the feelings of self doubt that has been engendered by being told for two generations that you are not capable of standing up on your own two feet that your achievements are not based on merit alone but on other more insidious factors how terribly confidence sapping it must be to have such thoughts always hovering in the background like a nagging doubt at the back of the head
8503231 she is currently studying mathematics in georgetown university in the united states and she is happy because she knows that she managed to get in because of what she did and not because she happens to be of the right race
8503232 i want to bring about that sense of confidence in the malays through the new economic agenda
8503233 now at the same time we would need at first to reassure the malays that they would not be marginalized by it and this is important because for the past 30 years they have been subjected to incessant propaganda which tells that without the nep they would not be able to survive
8503234 the younger generation of malay malaysians are rejecting the politics of fear race and religion
8503235 how we view issues like religion culture language and education is still important therefore within the pakatan rakyat peoples alliance the combined opposition forces in malaysia leadership we have already spelt out a clear agenda and this is based on the constitution where islam is the religion of the federation with guaranteed freedom of practice for other religions because malaysia is a multi religious nation and we cannot have and should not have had high handed and unjust incidents such as the demolishing of temples
8503236 it is important to have a national language and everyone should be encouraged to be proficient in bahasa malaysia but we should not do this at the expense of english
8503237 be committed to enhancing the proficiency of english in malaysians because it is the international language of business and trade otherwise malaysia will lose out in economic and human development
8503238 we need to have more serious efforts in the teaching of english in malaysian schools we cannot afford to continue on in the haphazard and directionless manner of today
8503239 mandarin is no longer just the language of the chinese in malaysia it has become a very important economic language of the region
8503240 masusi naming pinupursige at pinag aaralan ang pagsasampa ng kaso laban di lamang sa mga smugglers kundi pati sa mga opisyal ng pamahalaan na nagpapahintulot nito we are seriously pursuing and studying the filing of charges not only against smugglers but also government officials who allow second hand vehicle importation

8503243 if nine of us are arrested you must continue to rally here
8503244 its our victory that police did not storm and arrest us last night
8503245 at this moment there are more than 10 000 protesters inside
8503246 they will prepare documents and hopefully by early afternoon police will enter government house with a court injunction and arrest warrants to meet with protest leaders
8503247 this type of situation has a negative effect on food security if peoples crops are destroyed immediately there is an impact on their food security there has to be consistent assistance to prevent further negative impacts such as malnutrition and disease
8503248 we want to resume other programs such as food for education food for training and mother and child nutrition intervention but the reality is saving lives and providing critical relief assistance has to come first
8503249 kailangan magkaroon ng international appeal kapag sinabing may humanitarian crisis it will enable odas overseas development assistance and ngos non government organizations na maitaas ang tulong nila
8503250 these kinds of events are happening all the time in d c the only difference is time place and altitude
8503251 democratic donors and members are all here in one place so naturally it makes sense that they would take advantage of the moment
8503252 i just cant take it anymore god please give me the sweet release of death
8503253 bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye byyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeee
8503254 we know you have to put information out there in as many ways as possible
8503255 there are so many organizations and clubs and specialty groups in which a student can be a part so it is a challenge attracting students
8503256 but i think when students are able to learn about all the options they are able to discern what is the right fit for them
8503257 we try to use technology too because that seems to be a more effective way of reaching people
8503258 our deacon is devoting a number of hours so were trying to engage students more intensively
8503259 mostly we just try and encourage the students who are involved to live their faith in such a way that its attractive to other people
8503260 tim is off on a search to rescue the princess she has been snatched by a horrible and evil monster

8503262 find the key then find the door and call that a puzzle
8503263 we believe land should be owned by new zealand citizens and residents only and our laws should be changed to say that we welcome ex pats coming home and people coming to this country to live but why should we allow singaporean australian or american speculators to buy investment properties in our country shutting first time home buyers from the market
8503264 snatching up new zealand property as the dollar drops banks lower interest rates and the market reaches realistic prices
8503265 for some years property has been out of reach of most young new zealanders trying to buy their first home farm or lifestyle block
8503266 the government has a responsibility first and foremost to ensure new zealand citizens and residents can afford to buy a stake in their own country
8503267 would to god that all the lords people were prophets

8503273 our aim is to make it make fun engaging and educational
8503274 my favourite experiment was the hovercraft where you use a balloon with a cd and they spin
8503275 our class has actually been doing science for some time
8503276 you have to sticky tape metal to metal and then the lights comes on like this
8503277 it really lets the kids construct their own understanding and age is no barrier to what they can do

8503282 the long answer is well ive lived in the philly area for most of my life and i know it well maybe too well so i figure nows my chance to get to know somewhere else l a is sunny and theres good vegetarian food
8503283 not only because people seemed to really appreciate it but because talking to farmers was like some kind of therapy so nice and relaxing made me want to quit journalism and become a farmer
8503284 im hoping california is like one big headhouse market everywhere you look fruits and veggies even if its not that way im going to have a little yard out there and i plan to start a garden so i will send you a tomato and you can decide
8503285 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8503286 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8503287 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8503288 he estado en muchas entrevistas y presentaciones y la mitad de las preguntas van sobre si mgs4 saldr en xbox 360 u otros formatos en el futuro me gustar a que me preguntasen sobre metal gear sobre nosotros y sobre nuestros futuros juegos y dejasen de cuestionarme sobre hardware
8503289 barack obama ist bereit amerika zu f hren und amerikas f hrung in der welt wiederherzustellen
8503290 hillary hat mit nachdruck klargemacht dass sie alles tun wird um barack obama zum sieg zu verhelfen
8503291 oh ok if you do this it sounds good but if you do thiiiis it sounds like a duly noted
8503292 success is the important thing propaganda is not a matter for average minds but rather a matter for practitioners it is not supposed to be lovely or theoretically correct i do not care if i give wonderful aesthetically elegant speeches or speak so that women cry the point of a political speech is to persuade people of what we think right i speak differently in the provinces than i do in berlin and when i speak in bayreuth i say different things than i say in the pharus hall that is a matter of practice not of theory we do not want to be a movement of a few straw brains but rather a movement that can conquer the broad masses propaganda should be popular not intellectually pleasing it is not the task of propaganda to discover intellectual truths
8503293 a being breathing thoughtful breath a traveller betwixt life and into piney woods

8503295 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
8503296 six years he has coached me thats when i started playing football
8503297 when i was in holy family he came up to me right away and said i can see a lot of potential in you right now and that is kind of when everything started
8503298 its been great having just one coach i wouldnt want to have a new coach i know him and know what he is about and how he coaches
8503299 yeah my high school career came pretty quick im not going to lie
8503300 i have been together with most of these guys for six years and we are all looking at each other just shaking our heads saying how quickly it has gone we have to see what we can do this year we just want to make it to heinz field and hope for the best
8503301 he stayed healthy all season and since then he has been in the weight room relentlessly
8503302 he is really put together and he has really worked on strengthening his body
8503303 the past few years we really just mainly focused him on offense but now on defense he is stepping up for an offensive tackle to get off the ball and try and stop him is going to be really difficult
8503304 inside this box is a very nice blazer that we bought you it was very expensive and its a very sharp coat it has a nice patch on the pocket with the school coat of arms youll look very nice in this
8503305 i dont want to be walking down on eight avenue homesteads main thoroughfare in a couple of weeks and see this coat on some other guy
8503306 you dont realize how many peoples lives he touched until you sit back and think about it
8503307 there were a lot of times i just wanted to stop by and shoot the breeze with him but just didnt get the chance
8503308 i had to tell him i was taking him to las vegas to get him to show up
8503309 otherwise he wouldnt have gone he didnt like being the center of attention
8503310 the way you replace that is by changing the way you play the game we will shake things up and be more of a defensive team
8503311 replacing someone of anthonys caliber is not easy we wont beat teams by six goals or more anymore but we will be just as good as we were last year
8503312 i think the team deals with pressure and expectations pretty well
8503313 we had the high preseason ranking last year and the guys have become accustomed to having a target on their backs they know they cant take a game off against anyone because they are getting every teams best game
8503314 i think it will be a great early season test with sewickley being the defending wpial and state champs
8503315 anytime seton lasalle and sewickley play its always a great game
8503316 for us to get back to the wpial title game it is honestly going to have to be all about effort we have struggled in the past by not providing great effort against weaker opponents
8503317 in the past we have played down to the level of lesser teams and we havent been able to grow from those games like we should have we have to be more mature this year
8503318 it is not every year that you get a chance to play for a title and with a lot of guys being seniors they understand that this is their last year
8503319 i have told our kids over and over that you cant look at our record through the beginning part of the season and let it be something that you put too much into when the conference season comes around
8503320 we need to use these first four games as what they really are a chance to get ready for the conference
8503321 in all seriousness i am hoping we play hard and stay healthy i told our kids a bunch of times that we could end up this season having a worse record than last year but having an overall better season
8503322 i think yes the talent is probably better than it has been in a few years
8503323 i think too the kids are interested more this group has always been very competitive
8503324 but i know that our kids are looking at it like you have to beat the best
8503325 were going to put him in the backfield a little bit
8503326 were going to have some packages for him on offense and give him the ball in good situations for him
8503327 any way i can help the team i just want to help the team win whatever the coach asks me to do ill do it
8503328 i like defense better you get to take out your aggression
8503329 the bottom line is that he gets to the ball
8503330 there are still some things he has to learn and hell be a step behind on certain things for a while but that shouldnt be the case by the middle of the season
8503331 no it really hasnt been a problem learning a new position
8503332 standing up gives me a chance to read the play better
8503333 hopefully this is the position that ill play in college
8503334 i told him this is a fun game to play
8503335 weve got our work cut out for us for sure
8503336 i think this will open a lot of eyes its a huge thing for us to show that colerain football is still here
8503337 they have already played a game and of course i think that is a big advantage for them because you make your biggest improvement from week 1 to week 2
8503338 really all i care about is that we go there and we hit i just hope we go there and compete hit and are prepared as best we can be
8503339 weve always had tough hard nosed hard hitting football games against them
8503340 we definitely have been rivals seems like every time we play them its a good game
8503341 its a good hard hitting clean football game and thats what we expect this friday
8503342 the important thing is when you play a good team you use it as a measuring stick for where you are
8503343 these first four non conference games you want to come out of them healthy and you want to play well you want to see yourself progress from week one to week two and so on youre looking to play better every week and go from there sure wed like to win them but the most important thing is preparing for the conference
8503344 certainly wed like to get off to a good start but this years team is not last years team
8503345 and the kids have to make their own track were not worried too much about what happened last year were focused on this season
8503346 were still experimenting with kids moving kids around trying to get the right chemistry
8503347 we really need to play a meaningful game to see where we are we have some veterans back and were counting on those kids to lead us
8503348 they look to be in midseason form already based on what ive seen from two scrimmage films
8503349 theyre really playing well they have a very diverse offense with a lot of different weapons that pose a real challenge in terms of how to defend them
8503350 any time you have that many seniors and a veteran team coming back youll be pretty good
8503351 theyre real aggressive and have some offensive weapons and do some things differently than theyve done in the past with the amount of throwing the ball
8503352 wed adhere to it and then our teams would go away to a piaa playoff game and the people there would be doing it
8503353 we had a discussion about it at a recent board of control meeting
8503354 it went around the table somebody made a motion and there was a second and while the vote was not unanimous it did pass that we would allow schools that are the sites for playoff games to hold 50 50s
8503355 why are you ranking us so high why dont you put somebody else up there
8503356 with all the talent we have we should have been ranked higher
8503357 menjaga stabilitas dan kepercayaan publik dalam sistem finansial as dengan mengasuransikan deposito mengawasi lembaga keuangan dan mengelola pengawasan kurator
8503358 we played a lot of juniors and sophomores last year so we have a lot coming back
8503359 as hard as it is to believe shes actually taken a few steps forward this year i think youd be hard pressed to find a defender better than her anywhere in this area
8503360 the defense is built around her and her abilities shes good enough to cover the ground of two people
8503361 this is basically the same team as last year that made it to the finals
8503362 shes kind of been waiting in the wings for her chance
8503363 shell have her work cut out for her but shell give us the opportunity to win games
8503364 im proud of them and i was privileged to be their coach for four years they put us on the map they set the bar high
8503365 i miss the girls and wish them the best of luck
8503366 but its time for a new chapter and time to allow the younger kids to play its going to be a challenge this year but its also going to be interesting and fun
8503367 i dont want to put pressure on her but shes the strength of the team without a doubt
8503368 shes already getting d 1 attention shes just an incoming freshman but shes legit ive had good goalies before but shes dominant the best goalkeeper ive been around itll be a major plus for us
8503369 theres no doubt in my mind theyre definitely the team to beat all the pressure is on them
8503370 im excited about this team and this year is going to be different
8503371 but our first goal is always to get into the playoffs
8503372 if we can win the section title thats great but our goal is the playoffs i told the girls if you win two playoff games then youre in the semifinals and anything can happen
8503373 all in all we have to play the ball on the ground which is our thing anyway
8503374 when we put the ball in the air in most cases we get outjumped the kids are smaller but we have picked up some great skill in these young players all of them are playing on a cup team and that is year round practice we have a lot of speed but in the long run our strength is soccer know how these players have a lot of skill
8503375 they are not as skilled as working the ball free and getting that shot on goal but they worked well together and they can shoot
8503376 the soccer players that we have had were soccer players
8503377 they were year round players they would play cup and indoor and be on select teams
8503378 before that we had a bunch of athletes who were enthusiastic about playing soccer and had some skill but that was before the trend of year round soccer the year round soccer has helped us and it was evident over the last nine or 10 years
8503379 at the end of last season i realized i had a chance and i have kept it in the back of my head as i have been training
8503380 it is something to go for that type of thing but its not my main focus as a team i think we can compete for a wpial championship we have a real strong team
8503381 she has made her decision for school and that is a load off her
8503382 she is very mature and is looking forward to having a good and solid year she just has so much strength she can turn with the ball and has really good quickness when she is on the ball it is so hard to knock her off it when you combine that with the skill level she possesses i hate the cliche the total package but she is pretty much close to that
8503383 we have been consistently competitive in the playoffs because the girls are used to being there
8503384 they are starting to realize what it takes to win at that level we have been pretty competitive for years getting into the playoffs its a mind set that they get ready for it
8503385 we are fairly solid top to bottom we just have to avoid any injury situation
8503386 we have a lot of size strength foot speed and a lot of experience hopefully we will be able to contend for the section championship
8503387 weve traditionally had a competitive non section schedule and that helps us compete in the section
8503388 i think we are ready to start the season we have to avoid injury that is a key for a successful season in the past we had a lot of detrimental injuries and it put us out early but right now we are injury free

8503390 barack and michelle obama are big fans of motown legend stevie wonder and are honored that hell be in denver to perform on thursday night
8503391 wed adhere to it and then our teams would go away to a piaa playoff game and the people there would be doing it
8503392 we had a discussion about it at a recent board of control meeting
8503393 it went around the table somebody made a motion and there was a second and while the vote was not unanimous it did pass that we would allow schools that are the sites for playoff games to hold 50 50s
8503394 why are you ranking us so high weve got a lot of questions and holes to fill
8503395 with all the talent we have we should have been ranked higher
8503396 those guys are not giving us any respect well show them this season
8503397 i think ive always been able to run but ive just always enjoyed throwing it as much as i could i feel like im running real well now and plan on taking off this year
8503398 hes grown by leaps and bounds in a lot of areas
8503399 ive talked to a lot of college coaches and hes on a lot of radars his arm has gotten stronger his release has gotten better and his feet have gotten better
8503400 but most of all his leadership on and off the field is just impeccable
8503401 its 2008 panthers football when we stepped on the field the first day of camp we knew we had to set an example for everyone else and thats how we want to play
8503402 when we have the pads off he likes to have a good time and joke around and everything but as soon as we step on the field hes all about football hes all business
8503403 theyve improved tremendously to the point were not afraid to run him this year
8503404 i have confidence in him to carry the football so it gives us an element we didnt have in him last year
8503405 we have a more mature team and theyve experienced defeat too often so they know that winning is everything
8503406 the most improved thing we have is our improved mental strength and our improved physical strength
8503407 a lot of the kids now have two years of experience of playing in the section and the playoffs mentally and physically we have a mature team now weve just got to use it the seniors have grown up together all of them
8503408 i was a little surprised to see that but rankings mean absolutely nothing
8503409 we just have to worry about ourselves and not everybody else well take everybody else as they come were preparing to win every game
8503410 if we do everything that we are capable of doing then well win im not worried about norwin im not worried about hempfield because it all depends on who comes out to play their best its up to the players its how much they want it
8503411 its good for hempfield to be ranked no 5 but its not how you start its how you finish
8503412 were not a team that has experienced success unless you want to call making the playoffs a success
8503413 if we want to get past the first round we need to go a little bit further mentally
8503414 in the second half of our game at fox chapel the kids woke up and did what they needed to do i cant take credit for that i just asked them during his halftime talk to give themselves some respect i think thats what were looking for this season just trying to get some respect
8503415 we had 46 kids come out so i had to make some cuts and i never had to do that before
8503416 now that weve just had cuts we can practice much better we can concentrate on what we have and take it from there

8503457 theres a range of sentiments from mild to outrage truly we had assumed this thing was not going to go anywhere

8503524 long live the people of israel who have so much freedom and democracy that they can prosecute their prime minister
8503525 on the same day in the same speech that ahmadinejad called for wiping off israel from the map he added that the destruction of israel is the first step of our final confrontation with western civilization
8503526 i want to tell you one more thing that the western countries dont understand or dont take it serious and thats the item of the mahdi the shiite messiah and they believe that once the mahdi comes the whole universe will convert to shiite islam
8503527 they have the money the missiles they are seeking to have the nuclear bomb and the life of humankind is not important for them
8503528 iranians are totally a different nation a peaceful polite moderate people who want a good life who adore the united states who respect canada who like western music but the regime in iran doesnt feel like theyre iranians mostly firstly they think they are shiite muslims and they have to work for the sake of islam and not for the sake of iran and they are sacrificing the iranian interest for the sake of shiism
8503529 we have to make our decisions according to the worst case scenario theyre going to have the bomb
8503530 theyre going to pursue an unrational way and theyre going to use the bomb if this is the case then i dont have any other choice but to pre empt it
8503531 they claim the israelis and the jews have a historical debt to the iranians because 2 000 years ago cyrus the great came freed jews from babylon and he sent them back to their country to build again their homeland iranian listeners say now thats the time you pay us back please come and help us to get rid of this regime
8503532 the clan has been one of the principle suppliers of heroin in western europe since the middle of the 90s
8503533 1 500 kg thats between 25 to 50 percent of what people consume in switzerland in one year
8503534 the influence of ethnic albanian criminal groups is still very strong especially in the heroin market and its not abating
8503535 the vast majority of heroin sold in switzerland still transits via ethnic albanian groups
8503536 they had a period of unprecedented access to european markets in the 1990s and early 2000s and took advantage of that and others took advantage of them but stopping speedboat traffic to italy had a big effect i dont think theyre competitive in the long term
8503537 but i dont think this makes for a very competitive drug trafficking group in the long term as violence attracts unwanted attention what tends to happen with these albanian crime groups is that they build up to a certain level then they shoot each other over an honor issue which undermines their place in the market
8503538 the swiss police are quite good in stopping the stuff and make a lot of seizures but it continues to be a place that a lot of traffickers favor
8503539 we dont know exactly where this surge in heroin supply is headed theres a belief that its being stockpiled getting banked

8503560 the fence will jut in at one corner like at petco field in san diego in arizona they have the overhang in centre field some stadiums have the seats right on top of the fence and fans are able to reach over the fence they try to make the stadiums more fan friendly and a little more eye catching and it causes for tougher decisions by the umpires
8503561 a lot of ballparks have those railings just on the other side of the fence its a tough call umpires go out there on a dead sprint trying to make a tough call unless its obvious why not get it right
8503562 as long as they dont hold up the game like they do in football
8503563 i remember one a few years ago in oakland where the ball was hit so high well over the top part of the foul pole
8503564 now even with a replay its going to be tough to determine where that ball really went
8503565 im surprised theyre doing it in the middle of the season
8503566 you kind of hate to see it just because youre starting to change the game really i think its probably going to be more fair and its probably going to be the right way to do it but its starting to change the game change the way its always been called
8503567 the game is fast its been played at a certain speed for years and to a certain degree you trust the umpires judgment
8503568 ive got an energy plan to sell dont you think this is the place to sell it
8503569 im totally nonpartisan im not making this political im all about america
8503570 ive got a mission and im going to carry it out
8503571 its a lot more aggressive than what you usually see
8503572 i think the airlines crystal balls are telling them its going to be a soft fall
8503573 airlines are creatures of habit and theyve never really done this before
8503574 i think they want to make sure those planes are full so theyre topping them off with these cheap fares
8503575 people giving themselves more time taking more connections using more of those options when they fly
8503576 a lot of consumers are getting very savvy about ways to save money
8503577 it will be interesting to see how this plays out
8503578 so you may want to go out and find that cheap fare now

8503581 its early in the campaign season and in the end the vote on this measure could be hard to predict
8503582 the burden is always on the yes side to convince people there is good reason to vote for the measure
8503583 if i was proved wrong i will resign is the minister ready to resign
8503584 sometimes you feel your life is repeated but it is not it is either an upward or a downward spiral depends on the phase of your life
8503585 we asked phyllis and del if they would be that first couple to be that test case to be that human face so that we could file a suit and ultimately get to the california supreme court and right some wrongs in our state
8503586 to do what theyve done to advance human rights is second to none
8503587 demanded equal rights and justice and she got it just a few weeks before she passed away
8503588 you cant separate an institution by making it a lower institution
8503589 how dare they have the audacity to say that today
8503590 really whats at stake is martins legacy and her life
8503591 i think its understandable frankly in this context and this political environment that a lot of folks are still not there yet
8503592 i understand the politics of this arguably better than any human being alive as a consequence of being defined as a politician by this issue
8503593 it does not make sense to me for lease rates to be negative assuming they are indeed negative as stated however just because something does not seemingly make any sense is not proof of manipulation in and of itself
8503594 so who else would be shorting gold at these low levels

8503598 the scaffold for a firefighters drill set up center stage was pretty interesting with the firefighters whooshing down the lines and then crawling back up again a victory for fire prevention education puts the whole country at ease
8503599 i especially liked the frame that stood in the center it conveys that beijing has always been swiftly developing city always a giant construction site
8503600 from day 1 when i came into this building ive always thought about the end
8503601 i never knew when it was going to be ive always prepared myself for life after football but football kept getting in the way for 14 years thank god
8503602 im going to miss the locker room if i didnt do anything else i hope i was a great teammate all i ever wanted to do was win
8503603 very few people look the part and are it too
8503604 quick lets get the republicans out of power before there is nothing left in the country for the democrats to ruin
8503605 the truth is that in national security terms hes largely untested and untried hes never been responsible for policy formulation hes never had leadership in a crisis or in anything larger than his own element on an aircraft carrier or in managing his own congressional staff its not clear that this is going to be the strong suit that he thinks it is
8503606 mccains weakness is that hes always been for the use of force force and more force in my experience the only time to use force is as a last resort when he talks about throwing russia out of the g8 and makes ditties about bombing iran he betrays a disrespect for the office of the presidency
8503607 computers in the future may weigh no more than 1 5 tons
8503608 i was most amazed by republican iowa congressman jim leachs speech ok he isnt an exciting speaker at all but it was like a trial lawyer building his case
8503609 i have listened to radio suffolk for the last few years as i cant get to the games anymore they were my contact with ipswich town
8503610 the fact that i am now faced with silence is very disappointing and annoying i have tried digital but that has made no difference so this needs to be sorted out
8503611 seeing every match is not an option as it is quite expensive so the radio is a lifeline i dont understand why the club would make such a daft decision and alienate an awful lot of fans
8503612 most of the details are commercially sensitive but the decision was taken on the basis of an entire package rather than just a financial package
8503613 we were aware that sgr needed to be able to broadcast to as many people in suffolk as the bbc although some of the individuals might not be the same we understand sgr has the ability to cover more people across the whole of the county
8503614 we cannot change anything about the signal until we get regulatory approval and that is still pending we have received emails from people in the sudbury area saying they can hear the station crystal clear but we are aware there are some issues in other parts and we are working hard to address them
8503615 plans have been talked about for about five years but earlier this year things had finally got going
8503616 last month we put forward our proposals to the pct and we were very disappointed to be told that the plans for the new centre will have to be put on hold while the pct develops a strategy for the area and decides on a way forward
8503617 we had hoped to get things underway as soon as possible and maybe start building work next year but now that does not seem likely
8503618 the pct is in the process of finalising its five year strategy in response to the health minister lord darzis final report which is entitled high quality care for all and in consultation with local people and stakeholders across the whole of great yarmouth and waveney
8503619 proposals for developments at southwold and elsewhere will be reviewed in the context of the strategy beginning in late october when we will be speaking to townspeople and local practitioners again
8503620 the surgery is full and the town desperately needs a new health centre
8503621 this planned one stop shop had seemed like a brilliant way forward and would have meant that people could have dealt with most of their health issues under one roof i think it is shame that the pct had decided to call a halt to these plans
8503622 to be quite honest i think it is a bit sad
8503623 they lost the school and pub back in the 60s and now the post office and village shop and for the post box to go it is a little bit silly
8503624 there is nothing that is it we are a dormant village now and left faceless with just a village hall
8503625 i would have thought post office could have found another site for it before they demolished the one outside the former postmistress house
8503626 everybody is going to struggle as it was so convenient but the elderly population who have no transport are the ones it will really hit they are having to rely on the good nature of the postman to collect their mail
8503627 my son ricky was in my bedroom looking for his underwear and he went into the draw under my bed and something crawled across his hand
8503628 he saw a huge spider and screamed to his sister cassie they tried to put a pint glass over it but it was too big they poked it with a coat hanger and the spider bit it
8503629 the dog came in jumped on the bed and barked at it the spider hissed and bella went running out whimpering
8503630 there was an electrician in the house and he came and looked but just ran out of the house
8503631 they said it was the size of a palm sandy coloured with a pink body and red knees
8503632 i think it must have hitched a lift back with my husband in june so its been in my house for seven weeks hes back out there now i called him and he said one of his friends had been bitten by one
8503633 im petrified of spiders i cannot live in that house until its gone
8503634 she was an active healthy dog it seems too much of a coincidence that she died at the same time that we saw the spider
8503635 i wondered if she had been bitten or if it sprayed something into her face when it hissed at her
8503636 the vet said they wouldnt know without an autopsy but said there could have been an underlying condition which was brought on with the stress of it all
8503637 ive searched the house and cant find it i dont know what to do i just want to get back in there but i cant with that spider in there
8503638 we get calls all the time from people who have unpacked their suitcase and found a gecko from spain or a frog from namibia
8503639 its perfectly possibly this man has folded up the sand spider in his clothes and accidentally brought it home with him
8503640 camel spiders are also called sun spiders they have a huge head and massive mandibles and it gives a nasty painful bite
8503641 we understand there is a second spider which the caller could not find we would advise people with creatures like these to try and contain them other wise they are difficult to catch suffolk homes
8503642 while eye fi cards work seamlessly with conventional sd compatible digital cameras the eye fi connected nikon d90 gives users an improved out of box experience and more control of wireless capabilities
8503643 the nikon d90 will include an eye fi menu that allows users to turn the wireless function on or off giving the user more freedom to customize how and when they want to use the eye fi card for example if a user is in a hospital or on an airplane or anywhere else where wireless connectivity is not allowed the user may disable the wireless function through the eye fi menu

8503651 i think last year they didnt have the points system quite right with guys not being able to move enough a la rich beem and this year it seems like the players think its a little too much movement but certainly theyve created some drama some guys are going to be thinking about just making the cut this week guys wouldnt probably be thinking about that normally

8503659 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
8503660 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity

8503664 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
8503665 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
8503666 theyre going all of these routes threats intimation to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit
8503667 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
8503668 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
8503669 everything was absolutely ideal on the day i bombed the pentagon
8503670 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama

8503692 all of gods children black men and white men jews and gentiles protestants and catholics
8503693 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8503694 and what i know is over the centuries the doctrines of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins

8503700 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8503701 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8503702 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8503703 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8503704 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8503705 we are connecting with fans and sponsors like never before
8503706 but we want things to continue to get better to continue to grow
8503707 yeh dont tell cold why yeh wanna be here yeh tell him why yeh need ta be here
8503708 it was the kind of storm mark twain would have wrote about
8503709 is that what the olympics wants no they want greg normans and fred couples and tiger woods they dont want guys youve never heard of
8503710 i love hanging with the young guys ive picked up the lingo my daughters 15 so now i understand what shes saying when shes talking to me
8503711 if i play well over these next two weeks i think ive got a chance
8503712 i had two weeks to try to impress nick faldo the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that
8503713 its a hockey thing in hockey guys grow the beards so i thought i would give it a shot and see if it works
8503714 the only way to learn experience without actually going through it yourself is learn from somebody else and i love to talk so i was more than obliging
8503715 it just feels like a great place to base ourselves while in north america
8503716 i feel like im in a dreamland i really cant believe it
8503717 im very happy to donate money to help young girls playing golf i spend about half of my time in the u s and i thought i should do something similar to korea where i have donated clubs and money to elementary school children

8503720 the best part about the break for us is we got to stay in first place for a month
8503721 all three teams have had great runs during the season and times where we struggled with injuries or whatever im just looking forward to see what happens
8503722 this break was good to defuse some of the negative publicity surrounding the incident we had
8503723 we felt we have a good opportunity to compete for an eastern conference championship this year and next year
8503724 shes an experienced player and makes our team better with her calmness and her pointers to our players
8503725 thats why coach laimbeer brought me here to do what taj mcwilliams franklin does best and thats definitely to help them win more games
8503726 she has that will where she will make her team win regardless of what adversity theyre facing you need somebody like that on the court
8503727 all seven teams still have a legitimate shot and a strong chance to work themselves either back into the race or improve currently in the race
8503728 championships are won on the road but its a lot easier when youre at home
8503729 playing against seattle or san antonio youd want that home court advantage
8503730 a lot of people question whether or not we can even make the playoffs but we still feel very confident
8503731 we still have a lot of talent left on this team and were just going to try to finish up strong
8503732 i was just telling our staff i really dont know what to expect thursday
8503733 and im sure it could get ragged at times its not the ideal situation but if you look at the big picture for the promotion of the league its probably best
8503734 im not happy shes hurt it happened and agler decided to put me in that spot
8503735 its an opportunity not really the opportunity you would really want but i am going to try to do my best we just have to use different options now and a lot of players are able to show what they can do that makes our team more versatile
8503736 since day 1 lauren or no lauren aglers been on me about being aggressive
8503737 ive done a good job of that so far throughout the entire season now that shes gone i have to look to score a little bit more but the way our offense runs even when lauren is on the court its equal opportunity everybody gets shots
8503738 i think both teams will come out with a lot of energy because players are rested and excited about playing
8503739 i think we can have a lot to say in the playoff race and i am excited about our chances
8503740 investigative reasons and also because of its poor quality the fact it only shows the man from behind and because the tonal quality of the black and white footage
8503741 the existence of the footage has never been a secret with it shown to 700 people during the exhaustive investigations to identify people inside and outside the hotel that evening supt byleveld said
8503742 police have been able to identify every one of the people in this vision except for this man
8503743 we would like this man or any person who recognises this man to come forward and contact crime stoppers on 1800 333 000 so that the special crime squad can complete this line of investigation

8503745 obamas relationship with ayers is an especially vivid milepost on his rise in record time from a local official who unabashedly reflected a very liberal district to the leader of national movement based largely on the claim that he can transcend ideological divides
8503746 shortly before caris corruption indictment by a federal grand jury in chicago in 2006 sen

8503748 no matter what help barack obama might get from sen joseph biden his newly named vice presidential running mate wont give obama much cover on the tony rezko front
8503749 i think every american that i know was weeping over the next several weeks and devastated and shocked was that an act of pure terror it absolutely was and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable

8503759 because what is commonplace to us is unique and in some cases exotic to people who come here
8503760 what were trying to do is show people the real the authentic p e i by getting them out there and doing these things because if they do chances are theyll stay longer and come back more often
8503761 you can feel and hear them down there lewis said to vermeulen and ijzerman
8503762 we want to open up the convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party
8503763 i was saying to my coach can you imagine if this happened during the match
8503764 i just realize i had to go more to the forehand because backhand she was making good shots
8503765 it kind of made me go outside of the court and defend

8503983 i have a dream where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls and walk together as sisters and brothers i have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted every hill and mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together
8503984 this will be the day when all of gods children will be able to sing with new meaning my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee i sing

8503986 backfired a nation born for religious tolerance no longer tolerates religion
8503987 the hijackers surrendered without any violence and the crew are safe and sound

8503989 we couldnt move we couldnt even scratch our heads we couldnt go to the toilet no water nothing
8503990 i was so hysterical i thought it was a disaster
8503991 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8503992 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need

8503994 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8503995 barack obama is ready to honour the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8503996 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8503997 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8503998 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8503999 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8504000 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8504001 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8504002 vomit piss angry riders and last night there was even a dude with his grocery cart
8504003 so did you read the book and what is your opinion
8504004 when i found that out i was thoroughly disturbed and i was very determined to make sure they got back with us
8504005 with everything he had been through and having survived i thought he deserved something of a chance
8504006 now they do not even allow us to gather together
8504007 the officials asked us to be patient they told us we need to support the olympics and after the olympics they will sort this out but we have been waiting for such a long time i guess they hope that if the time is long enough we will just forget this
8504008 oh its a long long while from may to december but the days grow shorter when you reach september when the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame one hasnt got time for the waiting game oh the days dwindle down to a precious few september november and these few precious days well spend with you at our caledon seniors centre these precious days well spend with you
8504009 we feel that the camp went really well this summer
8504010 it took a lot of energy and persistence but we pulled it off then the summer went by quickly
8504011 how much easier it is to be critical than to be correct
8504012 it offers opportunities to people who like to demonstrate their bad driving

8504015 the persons case of 1929 is important because it marks the moment when canadians could no longer exclude women from universities professions or politics
8504016 it is amazing to see how far we have come and learn about what women before us had to go through
8504017 itll be very small probably about 20 or 30 people
8504018 restaraunts night clubs and the mall have all benefitted greatly local retail sales are up nearly 50 and restaurants have nearly all sold out for the next week and a half
8504019 people are buying this online casinos stuff like hotcakes im thrilled about the success of these products
8504020 ive got double the usual number of orders since the conferenced started this means our company will probably have a surplus at the end of the year and will allow us to continue strong into the next quarter
8504021 im so thankful that many online casinos industry heavyweights took time out to come and talk to us ive learned a lot of new things found out industry news and was able to network successfully with others who have jobs similar to mine
8504022 it didnt mean anything she means nothing to me it was just sex

8504026 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aide using battleships
8504027 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8504028 a concert of this nature is not conducive to teach the younger generation to become good citizens upright and competitive but instead would weaken them morally and mentally if the concert organisers do not heed this warning to cancel the concert pas youth will order all muslim youth to turn up and protest the concert in order to prevent it from taking place
8504029 i dont know what the feeling is it is maybe disappointed its probably a lot of feelings mixed into one
8504030 like i said it was real close it could have easily gone the other way naturally hes going to be disappointed he didnt get the job he put so much effort into it i completely understand that ive been there
8504031 im anxious to see how hell be once were rooming together at the team hotel friday i hope it doesnt turn out to be him being so disappointed he doesnt want to be cool with me anymore i hope to goodness its not like that i hope nothing bad comes out of this
8504032 we were pretty good friends before and i think we will be still
8504033 the competition was so tight i think its only right to play us both and see how it pans out
8504034 pats a good player man we worked together all summer trying to get this thing done because we didnt know what was going to happen obviously he wanted to start and i wanted to start
8504035 but there was a huge possibility that there was going to be a dual system we just did not know with him playing saturday i think its good i dont think it will shake up any of the chemistry with the offense
8504036 a lot of things are running through my head right now
8504037 im playing the game over and over in my head each and every day id be lying to you if i told you i wasnt nervous about saturday because i am i really want everything to work out
8504038 god forbid i play terrible and have to get yanked i hope everything goes smooth and goes well
8504039 honestly im not really sure about the duration of the season
8504040 i think joe wants to see what happens this saturday i dont really know if its just this game or the rest of the season i would hope its the rest of the season but im not sure
8504041 right now ive kind of been consumed with this fighting for the job so as of right now im just going to continue to work hard and keep doing my thing
8504042 this is part of 50 5 million in funding that the rudd government is delivering to fix black spots on local roads across australia
8504043 we are committed to reducing crashes on our roads accidents take a huge toll on families our communities and the economy
8504044 this is a serious investment in safer roads for local motorists and their families this project will help drive down the appalling social and economic cost of road carnage
8504045 an evaluation of the black spot program has shown that it prevented at least 32 fatalities and more than 1 500 serious injuries in its first three years
8504046 it also returns around 14 for every 1 invested by reducing the number and cost of crashes
8504047 im proud that the rudd government will honour its election commitment to increase black spot funding by a massive 33 per cent next year up to a record 60 million this means safer local roads for motorists cyclists and pedestrians
8504048 the new signs will promote the heritage listed buildings and tourist attractions throughout the palerang shire and will provide tourists with a uniquely palerang experience
8504049 not only will the signs tell the story of the towns they will encourage visitors to travel throughout the region to find out more about the amazing history of the area
8504050 the new signs will promote historical tourist attractions such as the braidwood historical museum historical walks the marble arch and wyanbene caves
8504051 this funding will give palerang council and the local chamber of commerce the opportunity to share the history of the beautiful buildings throughout the town with tourists
8504052 both the braidwood and bungendore districts have some of the most historic and culturally significant tourist attractions in the state and the region is a real asset for tourist operators
8504053 its fantastic to see palerang councils dedication and commitment to improve facilities which will enhance the experience of its visitors
8504054 this region is growing in popularity with tourists domestic visitor nights have increased by almost 10 per cent over the last year to 900 000 nights this is fantastic news for the region and shows the hard work and determination of the council and local tourism operators to attract more visitors to the region
8504055 since i came to australia ive been coming and watching and supporting glory rukavytsya said
8504056 theyve been one of the best teams in the league back in the day so i want to see that happen again
8504057 it would mean a lot for the club and for perth its been such a great club and its still a great club and hopefully it will be one of the best in australia again
8504058 we expect some clubs to come up with lame offers
8504059 if anyones serious it will need to be an exceptional offer
8504060 we had to give chris judd up for the third selection in last years draft because he was out of contract but daniel kerr is contracted
8504061 so wed be entitled to another pick in the first three as well as an additional draft choice inside the top 10
8504062 daniel wants it all on his terms and that is not going to be the case
8504063 everyone thinks hes leaving but we doubt whether any other club has the firepower to get him
8504064 i have meetings with every afl club every four weeks and at some stages they have brought up daniel kerrs name
8504065 i have to give credit to daniel because he does get a lot of negative focus

8504077 we are going to work things out and remain married
8504078 the lord gave my wife and i some sweet peaceful time which was refreshing for both our marriages health and our physical health
8504079 the lord worked in my youth group in amazing ways this week he met us through the speaker and events there but also through the beauty of the camp

8504084 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain

8504090 if i have to burn this whole city down to find the truth among the ashes i will do it
8504091 jim what should i do for these gtlvref settings in the bios
8504092 well they are supposed to scale based on fbs qdr and
8504093 but we gave new lowell credit they made key defensive plays when they needed them
8504094 ive already received a lot of calls for players to part of the team next season
8504095 so its better to have too many players than too little
8504096 news 9 year old boy told hes too good to pitch
8504097 the most wired hospital isnt necessarily the best decision making organization
8504098 back then it was still a little bit of an exotic item
8504099 now they receive one as a high school graduation gift
8504100 when i first showed them the camera and how easy it was to put a video on youtube they looked like i had just pulled a rabbit out of my hat
8504101 a lot of students watched and we got a lot of feedback from people who were angry about the policy
8504102 a lot of kids told me later they used that video in discussions in other classes
8504103 this is a new platform for learning in the same way a laptop or a desktop was a new platform
8504104 the time is approaching when these little devices will be as much a part of education as a bookbag
8504105 he has no identification papers no freedom of movement and no rights in this country economically or socially speaking instead he has been forced into a situation reminiscent of house arrest without any possibility of for instance earning an income
8504106 i am suing norway to check whether i have all the rights i am entitled to
8504107 im only demanding to get what i am entitled to and i dont care how people react
8504108 proud of what al zarqawi has done and that he has become a martyr
8504109 bbc programme makers and reporters decide what and how stories are reported there is absolutely no truth in any implication that the bbc compromised editorial independence
8504110 the programme was commissioned a long time ago we would not be in the position of having our editorial decisions prompted by people outside the organisation
8504111 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq leadership and supporters and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
8504112 said imam also known as dr fadl is seen as the godfather of jihadi thought
8504113 leadership drew on his edicts for years but last november he published a devastating treatise that drew on islamic law and jurisprudence to argue that resorting to violence is banned and so was rebelling against a muslim ruler he writes to young muslims urging them to turn away from recruiters
8504114 if it cant be done i have great concern that these hearings will be virtually or exclusively classified closed to the public and i might add to the detainees
8504115 so small he said he had to double up his limbs in the foetal position
8504116 kept alternately in suffocating heat and in a painfully cold room
8504117 bright lights and eardrum shattering sounds 24 hours a day
8504118 granted access to the detained terrorists at guant namo and heard their claims
8504119 produced solid information that has contributed directly to the disruption of terrorist activities
8504120 honestly its irreconcilable differences and its best that we part ways at this time
8504121 it is awfully hard theres a lot of emotion there obviously but everything happens for a reason
8504122 it was a good run i dont have any regrets a lot of positive things have and will come out of this
8504123 obviously im sad that i dont get to play my senior year at ecs but its unfortunate that it took 11 players to leave ecs before they finally let him go i know a lot of them left because of baxter
8504124 the reason i chose to leave was baxter totally blew my confidence in playing
8504125 he just never gave me a chance to play back row in practice he said i wasnt up to par i could see if he had given me constructive criticism about it but what he gave me hurt my feelings and made me play worse
8504126 when i was in the eighth grade he was a good coach and he was very involved in practices
8504127 but the past couple of years he just put all of that responsibility on the seniors and he wasnt really involved i dont think he has the passion for it
8504128 it was just too much i couldnt handle it anymore i had to get out of that environment if i wanted to go and play in college
8504129 maybe thats why he was more laid back i dont know
8504130 he was always a nice coach he taught me a lot of things and we had a lot of fun there
8504131 i loved playing for him at ecs i thought he was an amazing coach
8504132 there were a lot of girls vying for the spotlight last year i think that might have been cause for drama
8504133 i always took his criticism as trying to make us better i never took it harshly hes a coach thats what hes supposed to do
8504134 im not easy im the first one to tell you that
8504135 am i intense yes do i expect a lot out of my players yes am i fair yes you dont win without all of those things
8504136 everybody thinks its so easy being on top but the top is not the greatest place to be there are a lot of expectations put on you and you cant always fulfill all of them
8504137 in four months we will have an administration that actually believes in science
8504138 because of this we need to tread carefully and somehow incorporate some fantasy into the reality standards whereby the player can do crazy stuff that basically adheres to the boundaries that would exist in the real world now im not saying that we shouldnt use things like doors walls or other kinds of barricades but it is important that they are consistent fair and conceptual and that they follow the visibility and affordance guidelines i discussed previously for example take a game that sees you walking alongside a cliff that wont allow you to fall off the edge no matter how hard you try this is probably a good thing isnt it theres probably nothing worse than running along when all of a sudden you make one slip up and down you go and yet if you can just hug the edge and no matter how hard you try it will just be impossible to fall off will this break the immersion more
8504139 an example from the comments from the previous articles discussions was an island here the obvious macro boundary is the ocean sure we can allow the player to swim but bogged down with equipment they can only go so far before they must either come back or drown another way we can keep the player on the island is to put a danger in the way sharks for instance work pretty well however if we use this kind of boundary then it becomes necessary to make the boundary visible from the onset which means our visibility and affordance rules now come into play the player can see the fins and as fins mean sharks they afford danger however if we had the scenario where the player swims out and sharks for no apparent reason suddenly attack them then it makes no sense but ensuring the player can see the dorsal fins from the shore reinforces that it may be pretty dangerous to try and swim away this now makes the boundary plausible and contextual of course if there happens to be a random boat moored up somewhere that wont allow the player to get in for some reason then this micro boundary breaks the macro boundary
8504140 siemens unterst tzt die initiative die f r mehr klarheit bei den anteilseignern und der ffentlichkeit selbst sorgen soll
8504141 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients and in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8504142 if they decline or for any other reason do not go ahead with the australian option the patient will retain their place on our waiting list and we will book them for surgery here
8504143 we will be using a single provider which will help to streamline the coordination between the dhb the provider and the families and we are also aiming to station a dhb person in australia to help co ordinate things on the ground for those families
8504144 only one of the properties has been occupied in recent weeks and that resident is now moving out residents of the property at the top of the slip voluntarily moved out last week
8504145 the hillside is on the move a much larger landslip could come down very quickly
8504146 this is not an ordinary slip that covers the road and is then cleaned up quickly cracks in the rock face and continuing movement make us concerned that a huge landslip could happen
8504147 i had no idea at the time that it was 1080 poisoning they were dying from it was awful they were out in the backyard along the fence and under the clothesline and some were still alive and wailing one was just flipping himself over and over that was all he could do
8504148 mfe legal will be contacting you separately on this matter as we have concerns over the use of this consent condition

8504150 this really is one of the most significant steps forward for cancer prevention in new zealand
8504151 the ethical question is not whether it is right to vaccinate girls against a cancer that can be spread by sexual contact it is how best we can protect the lives of new zealand s women
8504152 in fact medsafe fast tracked the registration of the vaccine for use in this country because the results of international clinical trials were so impressive

8504156 it was the first time we had rowed together and some rowing teams had been together for eight years so it wasnt the ideal situation but thats the way the sport works out sometimes
8504157 more time spent with a rower in the boat definitely gives you more confidence and better boat speed so thats encouraging
8504158 im pretty excited to see my family and catch up with friends
8504159 the republicans said i was too young and too experienced to be commander in chief
8504160 btw obama is now officially the democratic candidate for the presidency of the united
8504161 moderates are akin to a substance with a neutral ph
8504162 it says more importantly that the changes to business confidence and the slowdown in the first half of the year and concerns about the global credit crunch havent dented the positive story for australia

8504224 this report reveals that many governments are demonstrating the will to change childrens lives but it also makes clear that there is much more still to do to protect children around the world from exploitive child labor
8504225 while the report showed a decline in the incidence of child labor around the world there are still millions of undocumented children working under hazardous and exploitive conditions

8504284 they graciously agreed and invited us into their home nieto said
8504285 now its not going to happen this is hitting me really hard
8504286 how they put all of us in that little house was a miracle brock said with a laugh
8504287 there was a lot of planning going on about strategy but there was a lot of friendliness too the group started mostly as a social one then it evolved into more of an activist group

8504300 its easy to understand the funding crisis that school districts across the state have when you consider that state funding to schools is frozen but our costs are not
8504301 in reality that 3 percent isnt even a cost of living increase but thats all we thought we could afford
8504302 you hate to have to go ask your taxpayers when you know theyre struggling but were all struggling for the same reason

8504314 they can blame umno all they want for their losses but they are realising it is the present leaders themselves who are condoning this situation
8504315 i think many of the grassroots may have the same sentiment but if the leadership still does not want to listen their time in the party may not be long too

8504343 and didnt take it for granted that it would be caught he kept the runner going it worked out for us

8504350 he was an important player in negotiations with foreign investors his whole stance in all his public speeches has been the acceptable face of libya saying we know theres a lot wrong in libya but we are putting it right but he also made pretty promises that have never been met such as setting up an independent tv station

8504432 the question most americans want answered about iraq is this when will our troops come home we already know the likely answer in 2006 they will begin to leave in large numbers in 2007 a significant number of the remaining 100 000 will follow we cannot sustain 150 000 americans in iraq without extending deployment times even if we could our large military presence while still the only guarantor against total breakdown is increasingly counterproductive
8504433 voted for the iraq war in 2002 but became a vocal critic
8504434 no strategy for success in iraq his plan is to muddle through and hand the problem off to his successor
8504435 as long as there is a single troop in iraq i know if i take action by funding them i increase the prospect they will live or not be injured i cannot and will not vote no to fund them
8504436 the hard truth is that our large military presence in iraq is necessary they are the only guarantor against chaos pulling out prematurely or setting a deadline divorced from progress in the areas ive discussed throughout the country will doom us
8504437 authorize d the president to continue participation by u s armed forces in multi national force iraq

8504487 each year us aid to israel exceeds that given to any other country since 1987 direct economic and military aid has annually totaled 3 billion or more in addition financial arrangements worked out solely for israel bring the total to about 5 billion a year this does not include such generous programs as the 10 billion loan guarantee granted israel in 1992 us law provides for the termination of all aid economic and military to any nation that develops nuclear weapons or engages in a consistent pattern of gross violation of internationally recognized human rights for years the us government has been aware of israels development of a nuclear arsenal and its persistent human rights violations but no president or congress has ever taken steps to terminate aid as required by law or even reduce it
8504488 since 1985 all us aid to israel has been a grant meaning that not a penny of it has to be repaid
8504489 the effect of this amendment is to guarantee that israel will always receive enough us aid to cover its debt obligations in actual practice congress always awards israel funds far in excess of these obligations no other country enjoys such an arrangement
8504490 this is a relationship based on a shared commitment to democracy and to common values
8504491 israel practices as state policy a number of measures that are illegal in the united states and other western countries these include assassination kidnapping expulsion detention without charges or trial land confiscation and collective punishment not to mention israels long standing practice of espionage against the united states its principal benefactor

8504506 the prime minister of new zealand angrily denounced israel and imposed diplomatic sanctions on it after two suspected mossad agents were jailed for six months for trying on false grounds to obtain a new zealand passport the plot which involved obtaining a passport in the name of a tetraplegic man who had not spoken in years provoked a furious reaction yesterday
8504507 in 2004 new zealand authorities became aware of a covert operation mounted by israels external intelligence agency mossad to secure nz passports which are keenly sought after by those who seek hassle free entry to most countries
8504508 the spy ring consisted of at least three mossad agents working from australia it later emerged that australia secretly expelled an israeli diplomat as a result of this scandal in nz and one new zealand jew
8504509 they duly pleaded guilty to a single charge and served three months of a six month sentence before being deported back to israel they were also each ordered to make a 50 000 payment to the cerebral palsy association as they had sought the passport in the name of an nz cerebral palsy sufferer

8504523 au will use whatever means are available and practical to alert students about emergencies
8504524 i thought facebook was a pretty good idea because students dont get information the same way people in the past used to get it
8504525 they arent watching tv as much or listening to commercial radio
8504526 we are looking at any kind of methodology to ensure that we can reach the maximum number of people in the shortest amount of time if one system is unavailable another may be available
8504527 were facing a good problem where au has grown into a great place to be
8504528 the point is not merely to understand the world but to change it

8504535 i like how sis is really focused on studying and scholarship for the purpose of service to people i am so lucky to have landed in a place where i can teach what i believe in

8504538 there are merits to both sides but what are the arguments what are the alternatives thats where we are rather than being a signatory just yet
8504539 some of the reporting on this has been incomplete and imprecise

8504541 chickering was great but the best this year was gm southwest
8504542 but aus decision to switch carriers this summer wouldve been a great opportunity to get the hpv vaccine covered
8504543 since some women have experienced bad reactions to the vaccine and it isnt yet available to men we didnt want to put a cost onto all enrollees if it wasnt also available to all enrollees
8504544 its male students sisters grandmothers and mothers who might encounter hpv and the vaccine is one of the ways men can help prevent it
8504545 the response has included students wanting to ensure the plan is student focused
8504546 from what ive heard there is a general consensus among students that the plan is addressing some of their concerns
8504547 students want to see an increase in need based financial aid and shift from our dependence on tuition for operational costs
8504548 there may be some differences in priorities in these things among the campus community
8504549 we hope the document is representative of the campus community

8504565 its nice to know that theyre going to try to find another way to at least keep ob to some extent
8504566 the object is not to close the hospital and if we have to discontinue some services at this time and then possibly look at those at a later date thats what our attempt is

8504575 sebetulnya koalisi yang mendukung sby sudah berantakan dari kemarin kemarin tahun tahun menjelang pilpres 2009 ini makin terlihat
8504576 dalam hal koalisi tidak ada perbedaannya karena idelologinya sama kalau pks ingin bergabung dengan pdip itu bagus karena kita ingin pemilu setidaknya diikuti dua parpol hasil koalisi yang sama sama kuat sehingga pemilu bisa digelar satu putaran saja
8504577 jadi semakin kuat koalisi semakin besar kemungkinannya menang dalam pilpres kalau partai berkoalisi mendukung satu capres tentu kan makin solid
8504578 proses pembentukan koalisinya kan masih dicari masih cair masih sulit melihatnya kita harus lihat perkembangan perkembangan selanjutnya kan ada pan yang juga mengusung sultan hamengkubuwono x kita lihat nanti saya rasa tahun ini akan mengkristal
8504579 itu soal nanti kan kita lihat dulu bagaimana prospeknya strateginya karena menjelang pemilu setiap partai punya strategi masing masing
8504580 ya tergantung bagaimana komitmennya visi misinya asas partainya saya kira kekuasaan harus dibagi tidak ada kekuasaan yang mutlak begitu saja tapi untuk membangun koalisi itu perlu waktu
8504581 namanya kan komunikasi sesama parpol jangan pikirannya langsung ke arah koalisi kalau membangun persepsi kan boleh boleh saja
8504582 semua partai kita intens kok menyamakan persepsi pdip maunya ini mau apa nggak
8504583 kita juga harus lihat hasil pemilu nanti setelah pemilu legislatif nggak bisa sekarang karena kita masih sama sama bersaing
8504584 kalau bangun komunikasi untuk mempertegas asas pancasila mempertahankan nkri ya mari
8504585 belum sampai ke arah sana saya memang ketemu dia hidayat sebagai ketua mpr dia juga memberi ceramah saat rakernas pdip dan acara di bali dia juga mengundang pdip tapi belum ada itu bahas bahas koalisi
8504586 istilah itu sudah terkenal dalam politik tidak ada pertemanan yang abadi semuanya sangat ditentukan situasi politik atau momen momen politik maka mendekati pemilu 2009 semua parpol melakukan reposisi
8504587 jadi semua parpol pasti akan melakukan reposisi seperti pan golkar ppp yang sudah mulai kelihatan tidak terkecuali pks itu sudah menjadi hukum dalam politik praktis semua parpol dalam situasi yang plural seperti di indonesia akan menampakkan perilaku seperti itu
8504588 pkb saja jauh jauh hari sudah melakukan perubahan dengan menjaring kader lebih luas lagi kini tidak hanya nu tapi ada juga kadernya yang dari muhammadiyah dan non muslim
8504589 kita harus ambil hikmahnya mungkin pikiran orang orang pks sudah mulai terbuka bahwa kalau partai mau hidup di indonesia harus tinggalkan fanatisme publik untuk saling mengerti kepentingan bersama
8504590 segala pintu harus dibuka kan berisiko kalau hanya 1 atau 2 pintu saja yang dibuka sebab belum tentu partai yang lain konsisten jadi jangan sampai terjebak karena kondisinya sekarang masih cair pertengahan tahun baru akan kelihatan

8504644 to tear out the old stuff that they did and we will put a new one back what ever he wants well put the quality back in and do it right the utah way
8504645 were looking for ways to get our name out there and theyre looking for ways to raise awareness about the genocide in sudan
8504646 i think part of the reason we want to keep the awareness up is that darfur doesnt seem like a very likely candidate for any kind of mass direct intervention from the world
8504647 well hopefully help amnesty internationals efforts in darfur and keep that discussion from fading out as so many things do in our news cycle
8504648 her kindness was always radiating outward to the campus and beyond
8504649 she was a person of accomplishments integrity compassion commitment and curiosity

8504651 although students may be motivated by money to turn in homework or even do well on tests it is unlikely that external rewards will develop a true love of learning
8504652 were all committed to a number of different types of activism and work in our community but were passionate people and were activists in our lives so we bring a lot of that stuff into our music
8504653 weve been on a few long tours together and i think every time its really awesome to spend time seeing the country and its really awesome to get to spend so much time doing what we love to do
8504654 the reduction in the underlying business performance of the gold coast parks can mostly be attributed to extended poor weather which covered all the major trading periods for the year including january school holidays
8504655 although it is often they who accuse us of being babyish needing a big daddy in the sky to lean on there is something profoundly immature about atheists
8504656 today atheism is big business with the success of books like the god delusion
8504657 the problem which western atheists miss is that to be a heretic here requires no bravery whatsoever
8504658 lets put this more simply for speaker nancy pelosi and her office madame speaker you cant reduce the churchs teaching to a 1 500 year old sound bite which you dont understand
8504659 what was augustines understanding of abortion keep in mind that augustine was working with the scientific knowledge of his day i think we can admit that we have progressed since the 5th century
8504660 but augustine also thought that males were vivified at 30 days and females at 90 days does like that position too or is she content simply to cherry pick ancient patristic sound bites she does not understand
8504661 recurrently he befriends kind sensible intelligent evangelicals and these people shift his religious anthropological paradigm more than his discovery of christians sex tips or their halloween hell house
8504662 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8504663 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out
8504664 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back tomorrow
8504665 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
8504666 and i know this is the last year of the stadium so you think about that
8504667 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career
8504668 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankee series for me
8504669 im not writing a hall of fame career just yet but its been nice to get off to the start ive gotten off to it takes a little bit of pressure off
8504670 hes a beauty hes kind of i think the energizer bunny for this team
8504671 you know hes the one that stirs stuff up every team has got to have that guy
8504672 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
8504673 we really have to come out and be perfect tomorrow
8504674 they are not going into this blind they are very professional and looking to use the best western consultants available
8504675 the country becomes the focal point of world sport that one weekend
8504676 five years ago we had to help journalists to understand this was a safe place
8504677 its a win win situation because for dubai you have the facilities done and as far as the stakeholders are concerned they make money out of the residential and commercial property
8504678 the emirati youth has little interest in sport compared to young people in other countries with the exception of football
8504679 emiratis have a soft and easy lifestyle but sport is not easy
8504680 from afar it looks like a kind of build it and they will come model but they wont come unless you invest and make them come
8504681 and if you effectively build over capacity its going to be very difficult
8504682 we got knocked down got off the deck threw a wild left hook and landed and it put us back in first place
8504683 but the way we lost you never know where thats going to lead you we have been resilient when it comes to those types of things
8504684 that wasnt the way we scripted it but it worked out that way
8504685 the demons of the past the rascals that have been hanging around here for a whole year getting on us
8504686 every time we lose a game like tuesday night its a reminder of that so we have to come back the next night and we have to face it and confront it and deal with it and move on
8504687 people around the world have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8504688 will facilitate the development of economic tourism and cultural exchange between the two sides

8504693 were seeing the same kind of generational the same kind of societal change that john f kennedy represented in 1960
8504694 john f kennedy was a risky proposition as a nominee in 1960 we had never elected a catholic for president of the united states he was young was he experienced enough is he too glitzy a lot of the same things you hear about barack obama you heard about john f kennedy in 1960
8504695 they need to know hell fight for them a plain talking tough leader and that this isnt all about sitting around the campfire playing guitars
8504696 its not just what he says its how he says it
8504697 can tell you hes ready but hes got to show that
8504698 he has to give real specific stuff and he doesnt do specificity
8504699 americans want the answers to the economic problems they want lower gasoline prices and they want to know how youre going to get there if its just one of those rhetorical soaring speeches all people will remember is his standing there and saying nothing
8504700 she said three adjectives that were positive about vice presidential nominee joe biden and no adjectives about barack obamas character accomplishments or anything
8504701 save jersey is quickly becoming one of new jerseys premier blogs
8504702 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8504703 my fellow democrats 16 years ago we prevailed in a hard campaign in which republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8504704 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8504705 barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home
8504706 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of power
8504707 president clinton was finally forced to testify that sen obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8504708 this election is a chance for america to tell the merchants of fear and division you dont decide who loves this country
8504709 you dont decide who is a patriot you dont decide whose service counts and whose doesnt
8504710 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8504711 folks remember when the world trusted us when they looked to us for leadership with barack obama as our president theyll look to us again theyll trust us again and well be able to lead again

8504723 we decided to do the poll because no one was doing it getting the opinion of the people most involved or affected by the way their constituency is run the people of jurong grc
8504724 although it was a simple poll of 2 questions it gives a reasonable feel of what the people of jurong grc think about the issue of having a by election there in the wake of the passing of one of its mps dr ong chit chung 478 singaporeans is a decent number to poll considering our very limited resources
8504725 russias main aim is to get support from the organisation for its military action and approval in one form or another for recognising south ossetian and abkhazian independence it is clear that russia is using it the sco as a counterweight to the west in the conflict and its recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia

8504740 russotto ha numeri da fuoriclasse denis una punta moderna vllaznia da non sottovalutare
8504741 ho avuto modo di vedere allopera gli azzurri in tv nella partita dandata contro il vllaznia e ho constatato che rispetto alla scorsa stagione sul piano tattico cambiato poco quasi nulla limpostazione sempre la stessa forse lunica novit o meglio nota lieta laggiunta nello scacchiere tattico di denis che rispetto agli attaccanti che aveva il napoli nella scorsa stagione tende di pi a venire incontro ai portatori di palla quindi una punta mobile far certamente bene un attaccante moderno non un vero ariete
8504742 contro gli albanesi non ho visto un reparto particolarmente in difficolt ritengo che ci siano giocatori capaci di risolverti le partite in ogni momento poi se proprio volessimo trovare il pelo nelluovo si potrebbe cercare unalternativa a vitale magari un giocatore pi esperto dello stabiese non guastarebbe
8504743 nonostante il risultato nettamente a favore degli azzurri credo che sar gara certamente vera nella quale gli albanesi lotteranno su ogni pallone anche perch si troveranno a giocare in uno stadio molto pi grande del loro impianto e quindi tenderanno a dare il massimo
8504744 sicuramente il ritiro nel corso di una stagione calcistica fondamentale sia sul piano fisico che sullla formazione del gruppo i giocatori hanno modo diconoscersi e capire pregi e difetti dei proprio compagni
8504745 vi posso assicurare che svolgere le sedute atletiche di mister zeman era una fatica disumana eravamo sottoposti ad un lavoro terribile le gradinate dello zaccheria credo siano consumate per il numero di volte che salivamo e scendevamo la tribuna del campo pugliese non ho fatto mai cosi tanti balzi nella mia carriera lesercizio pi massacrante erano le ripetute sui mille metri che dovevamo percorrere in meno di quattro minuti la sua era una mentalit vincente alla fine dovevamo segnare un gol in pi agli altri questo era il suo dictat anche nelle partite dove eravamo avanti gi di parecchie reti ci chiedeva sempre di spingere al massimo altrimenti ci distruggeva durante la settimana per alla fine uscivamo da tutti gli stadi a testa alta belle soddisfazioni abbiamo raccolto
8504746 napoli una piazza esigente siete stati abituati per troppo tempo a grandi risultati e perdere consecutivamente 3 4 gare allinizio del campionato per voi una cosa inconcepibile zeman un tecnico che ha bisogno di tempo per applicare al meglio la sua mentalit di gioco putroppo il duo ferlaino corbelli non lo fu dello stesso parere anche a foggia in serie b era partito malissimo alla fine del girone di andata eravamo ultimi forse anche perch risentivamo dei suoi carichi di lavoro ma credetemi nel girone di ritorno eravamo delle saette in campo per pochi punti non conquistammo la promozione diretta
8504747 sicuramente ciccio baiano tecnicamente era un gradino superiore a tutti quanti noi del gruppo di zemanlandia in allenamento era quasi unutopia togliergli la palla putroppo seri infortuni gli hanno condizionato non poco la carriera col tempo sono sbocciati altri talenti come beppe signori rambaudi shalimov padalino gente che ne ha fatta di strada
8504748 un allenatore che ha alle spalle una carriera da calciatore secondo me parte gi meglio rispetto a tecnici senza esperienza diretta del campo di gioco sono nettamente avantaggiati lesperienza ti riesce a farti capire i problemi di collocazione di un giocatore ti agevolano sul discorso interpersonale anche se per ci sono alcuni sporadici casi che smentiscono la mia tesi lesempio di arrigo sacchi lesempio pi lampante ma credo rester una rarit
8504749 lothar mattheus un giocatore universale poteva giocare in tutti i ruoli ha iniziato la sua carriera come punta poi lo hanno adattato regista ed infine ha chiuso la sua eccezionale carriera come difensore centrale davvero fortissimo
8504750 lanzafame e russotto faranno grandissime cose in serie a il primo un ragazzo molto valido e gi disciplinato tatticamente credo si ritaglier il giusto spazio a palermo russotto invece un ottimo elemento il classico trequartista dotato tecnicamente e capace di svariare da una parte allaltra del campo con una velocit invidiabile ha dei colpi da fuoriclasse
8504751 gilardino sicuramente ritorner con prandelli ad esprimersi ai livelli di parma a mio avviso ha fatto bene anche a milano purtroppo non gli stata concessa la giusta continuit per questo non si espresso a grandi livelli

8504771 family members of shahbaz who used to run computer classes in lucknow were taken aback when up and rajasthan police reached his house in the night they seemed genuinely surprised by his arrest as they had no inkling of his involvement with subversive forces we have spoken to our counterparts in rajasthan and they say shahbaz had not disclosed his terrorist face to his family members

8504777 young people aged 15 to 29 are the most affected with 25 percent of women and 17 percent of men in that age group attempting suicide
8504778 it probably has something to do with the situation of young people in greenland where school isnt always up to standards a high proportion of parents are also unemployed or have alcohol problems and theres a lot of sexual abuse of children
8504779 if we look at actual deaths by suicide there are some 45 to 50 each year these figures are very high among the highest in the world
8504780 suicide attempts are twice as common among women but men more often succeed at their attempts

8504782 sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8504783 you know not what you are given but forever will you know what has been taken away from you
8504784 thoughtful and rigorous debate might be the ultimate moral act
8504785 the power of our example rather than the example of our power
8504786 the constitutions architects never conceived of the president as the man in charge of national destiny
8504787 the cult of the presidency americas dangerous devotion to executive power
8504788 change its time for change i mean how can anybody disagree after eight years of bush thats one of the problems i have about obama he looks good he smells good and hes like a fresh flower but we dont know anything about the man and the people dont either and i think this is why mccain is gonna probably win
8504789 i think mccain is predominantly a conservative but hes able to conveniently modify his positions and he calls it maverick or reaching over to the other side im a purist i wanna know if youre gonna be here today youre gonna be here tomorrow maybe thats not smart politics but thats honest
8504790 i think my fathers a lot more honest about his political philosophy than mccain is
8504791 john mccain greatly respects barry goldwater a conservative icon and one of arizonas great public servants throughout his career john mccain has been known as conservative who has been willing and able to reach across the aisle to solve the problems facing our nation
8504792 i like ron paul because he has a message thats consistent its the same today that he was yesterday
8504793 a lot about my fathers book conscience of a conservative
8504794 i will vote for mccain and ill probably work for him
8504795 what i hope to see is an honest discussion of issues and i hope not to see a lot of mudslinging and dirty campaigning thats maybe hoping for too much but it would be nice to have an honest discussion of issues
8504796 i mean nobody talks about immigration have you heard anybody talk about immigration hello that was a big issue a couple of months ago
8504797 anytime the economy is in trouble the party in power gets spanked by november if things are getting much worse republicans are really gonna take a spanking i mean people talk about a bad economy but it aint that bad yet its gonna get worse
8504798 you know not what you are given but forever will you know what has been taken away from you
8504799 but its a pretty good compliment especially when you look at the guys trying out and at the guys coming back from last year
8504800 im not going to take that for granted though it doesnt mean im not going to try as hard im just going to go out and do what i have to do pretty much
8504801 people have always told me that and ive never really felt pressure from just being a local kid
8504802 everyone from heres been great to me and no ones been hard on me or anything like that if anything theyve probably been too soft on me
8504803 being captain i think they picked me for a reason its because i do something right they know what i play like and what kind of person i can be so i dont feel any pressure from that
8504804 the captains wall up there seeing their two pictures as the last two guys who are close friends of mine
8504805 i wouldnt say i was bred for it but ive definitely learned things from those two guys
8504806 the populations that bear the greatest burden nationally blacks for example and men who have sex with men are highly represented in new york city
8504807 because hiv is more prevalent within those groups the risk of hiv infection per sexual contact is higher
8504808 this is a core group which is at high risk for getting and spreading hiv
8504809 the ban does seem a pretty draconian way of addressing the issue
8504810 but the reality is that blue cod has been in decline for a long time and maybe this is the measure that needs to be taken to make us sit up and notice that there is a problem
8504811 html is the dominant document format on the web and
8504812 therefore our vision will be done with utmost respect with a continuity of zombies work but also a real evolution of the world he set in place
8504813 there doesnt seem to be a lot of room for discussion or debate
8504814 i think there is some positive news that comes from this today
8504815 whats noteworthy about this poll is how deep the support for proposition 8 goes
8504816 the fundamental question here is are we going to eliminate the fundamental right of marriage for same sex couples
8504817 no camp received 1 million from equality california a major gay rights organization

8504823 i think especially for students to be able to go to the national performing arts center which serves not just the community but the entire u s and with all the groups that the kennedy center brings in accessible at their fingertips it is a great opportunity for students in the area
8504824 all you see in the final performance is what the characters have come up with and worked on but when you see the rehearsal you see the process and thats the most important part
8504825 i want everybody to understand why im so proud to have joe biden
8504826 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8504827 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8504828 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8504829 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8504830 with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8504831 but i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country for example john thinks that during the bush years weve made great progress economically i think its been abysmal
8504832 and in the senate john sided with president bush 95 percent of the time
8504833 these times require more than a good solider they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8504834 can relate to the kind of struggles that people in america and in colorado are feeling right now
8504835 hillary clinton could not have delivered a more genuine and impassioned message as to why this country needs barack obama as president of the united states
8504836 hes a brilliant speaker his rhetoric is fabulous he really is inspirational
8504837 he has to convince people he has a plan for the economy he has to get in the weeds
8504838 thats what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what reagan did with gorbachev thats what nixon did with mao i mean think about it
8504839 john mccains ad is another dishonest and desperate attack that bears zero relationship to reality
8504840 fate history and everything else will be on the line
8504841 its on his shoulders its important for barack obama to take it to john mccain
8504842 together vice president cheney donald rumsfeld and john mccain brought more than a century of experience to our foreign policy challenges and what did that get us one international debacle after another
8504843 we deserve better than john mccains jokes about bombing iran or his denials that iraq has distracted us from afghanistan
8504844 we deserve better than a foreign policy thats more confrontational than george w bush and fails to address the complex challenges of a changing world we need leaders who recognize both our national interest and our shared challenges who will pay attention to both allies and enemies and who will truly make america safer and stronger i can think of none better than barack obama and joe biden
8504845 the information can change so quickly and vary so much that you dont know whats true or not
8504846 whenever youre doing research papers it takes forever to go to the library to find a book that they may not even have

8504861 second instal sharia islamic law on the entire earth and spread islamic justice there the attacks will not cease until after the victory of islam and the setting up of sharia
8504862 we have spent months exploring our various options regarding the financing of the construction of the new stadium
8504863 given construction costs and nfl and lender requirements for paying down our debt and after much thought and analysis we decided this psl program is necessary all the net proceeds from the sale of psls will be used to fund construction of the new stadium
8504864 its both an emotional and complicated process to establish the price structure in a new building that has an evolving manifest
8504865 our goal with the new jets stadium is to create the best home field in football and provide a range of seating options
8504866 we listened to our fans in designing this plan that is why we decided to have no psls in the entire upper bowl including those on the 50 yard line
8504867 is the closest thing to having a spot on the roster
8504868 our most loyal fans will always be at the front of the line
8504869 my goal with the new jets stadium is to create the best home field in football
8504870 in 2010 that goal will be realized when all jets fans can say finally were the home team
8504871 a seat in the coaches club is the closest thing to having a spot on the roster
8504872 what the jets are doing is different than the giants
8504873 they are leaving 27 000 seats psl free a large portion of the stadium fan base will be able to buy seats without having to purchase a psl
8504874 unfortunately i wont be able to stay in section 228 because it looks like it will be 7 500 for the psl and 400 for the game
8504875 i think thats unreasonable for anybody i dont care who you are so ill just move to the upper deck so i can keep my seven seats
8504876 my reaction was happiness that there was actually an option without psls
8504877 the good news was that there are no psls in the upper deck
8504878 supposedly the revenue theyre generating 370 million in psls is the same as the giants which means that the remaining psls are all increased in cost to make up for not having psls in the upper deck
8504879 i dont think theres anything including super bowl iii that matches what the impact that this has
8504880 with the team with in florham park youve done everything you can do to put a winning team on the field we want to go as far as we can go in many ways this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy these seats
8504881 delaware can get another senator my children cannot get another father

8504884 my aunt is finding me a wife as we speak
8504885 what kind of man gets his aunt to find him a bride
8504886 we have a lot of veterans from last year so i have to look at them to see if they were serious over the summer or not and that will make a big difference on how many open spots we have
8504887 the players have to be ready theres no conditioning we dont have time for conditioning and thats where the veterans have a little bit of an edge because i know what they can do on the ice
8504888 but if they come here and theyre not in shape thatll be a strike right there for the veterans its what theyve done over the summer which will be key
8504889 there are four guys who are more than capable of playing in the league and its going to be a fun competition to see who gets there
8504890 im just going to go out play my game and not change anything i had a strong season last year and feel good about it and im just going to carry that into this season
8504891 with the rookies we have morgan ellis and spencer macdonald who are high picks
8504892 jean sebastien fournier i heard is a pretty good quarterback
8504893 up front its nice to see european pick artem demkov and michael stinziani on the roster too but we have maxmillen lasieur who i saw with the under 17s whos a good skater at 16 years old evan brannon coming to camp will be in good shape we have robert mccarthy who played with lewiston at 16 and hes coming here at 19 so its going be short but a lot of fighting for positions
8504894 we won the first series last season but we want to do better

8504915 the total bill to the taxpayer was only 87 billion
8504916 we thrive in markets that are overdeveloped and overdeveloped markets always have people that are struggling or underperforming we dont really care because were not the chamber of commerce but the more people there are in the market the better it is for us because we take the top end of that business i would prefer that our neighbors be successful but their success is not entirely relevant to our own performance
8504917 i dont want to be too sophisticated here but 2007 is going to suck all 12 months of the calendar year
8504918 es hat 1992 nicht funktioniert weil wir auf der richtigen seite der geschichte waren und es funktioniert 2008 nicht weil barack obama auf der richtigen seite der geschichte steht

8504921 these games are not ready to launch in early 2009 but are being worked on by all development teams
8504922 if there is any perception that nintendo is ignoring the core gamers its a misunderstanding and we really want to get rid of that misunderstanding by any means
8504923 we need to assess whether the engines had any bearing on the lack of power suggested by the survivors

8504946 i actually thought a coach couldnt motivate me to play football
8504947 when youre too soft and dealing with football players they tend to take on that same soft attitude as long as someones hard on you youll be fine
8504948 youve got to make sure you have a great opportunity to win in non conference

8504954 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8504955 we dont need to be playing these games obviously you see in the league that guys are getting hurt you dont need to play

8504978 host of opportunities here our job is to dangle hundreds of hooks in the water
8504979 youll leave feeling better well come up with some sort of plan
8504980 when in was a new teacher in 1981 i remember my first day of high school at mash milford area senior high
8504981 and they were throwing stuff at you it was overwhelming so i said we need the same thing for freshman
8504982 the results were better than it shows ive been working with rope pride pitching coach john roper in the bullpen on staying back
8504983 he burkett had two hitters hit opposite field home runs and theyre both really good hitters
8504984 he was throwing a few more pitches a little differently
8504985 were not going to mail it in we want to win some games going out just because were not in the playoffs doesnt mean were going to fold it up and let everybody win you know what i mean weve still got some pride
8504986 i just went by on his way to the third base coaching box and told him he blew the call
8504987 and he couldnt let it go i ran by i wasnt showing him up he had to say something back which is fine but thats what ticked me off
8504988 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8504989 if thats the case if im moved to a club that has postseason possibilities you cant be disappointed as a player
8504990 ive had a lot of fun here and ive been happy with bobby cox and the organization
8504991 all of us have been inspired by senator obamas candidacy i stand here so proud of our party so proud of our country so awed by the journey our nation has taken to arrive at this moment but our historic journey will not be over until we elect barack obama the next president of the united states
8504992 i know something about historic journeys more than a decade ago i was the first woman elected governor of new hampshire with your help i intend to become the first woman senator from new hampshire
8504993 and let me be clear on an issue i know is of great importance in our granite state
8504994 let me renew my pledge to veto any sales or income tax we dont need new taxes we need lower electric rates and we need better schools
8504995 in 1996 jeanne shaheen stood before the democratic national convention and offered promises about education and taxes that would prove to be nothing more than empty election year rhetoric
8504996 i havent looked at senator mccains voting record we know that he has been there with the president every step of the way
8504997 when it comes to the concerns families in new hampshire are facing right now economic policy down the line with bush the bush budgets the war in iraq down the line with bush
8504998 that has been my experience in new hampshire i think our voters know what is at stake
8504999 she spoke to the concerns the full convention has people came out of that convention very united
8505000 when this board votes on the bonding i demand that alderman tamposi not be allowed to vote on this due to the fact that fairmont associates who owns a portion of the property of land to be taken for the project is owned and operated by the tamposi family and this will constitute a conflict of interest
8505001 the ordinance defines a personal and pecuniary interest as one involving you or your spouse parents children step children brothers sisters step brothers or step sisters
8505002 this is clearly not the case and the ownership of property by members of your extended family does not give you a direct interest
8505003 essentially deals with influence peddling which your facts do not even hint at
8505004 i asked for the corporation counsels opinion to make sure i was in the clear
8505005 no one has ever asked me if im involved in any of these properties
8505006 some of my family members i dont even talk to
8505007 we continued to invest in price and gave increased focus to promotions both of which helped to drive sales and win customers but as anticipated impacted margins
8505008 in europe as part of albert heijns price positioning strategy food price inflation was only partially passed on to customers during the quarter and strong promotions including the euro 2008 football championships temporarily impacted margins
8505009 in the united states the value improvement program has now expanded beyond price repositioning to marketing and branding
8505010 we are confident we will manage the balance between sales growth and margin and deliver our underlying retail operating margin guidance for 2008 of 4 8 5 3
8505011 what is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety
8505012 the risks associated with surveillance increase with the range and volume of information collected
8505013 the government has a crucial role to play in maintaining the trust of the public any evaluation of the use of surveillance must take into account the potential risk to this relationship with the public
8505014 we zijn dit kwartaal verder gegaan met onze prijsinvesteringen en hebben nog meer nadruk gelegd op promotionele activiteiten
8505015 in europa is als onderdeel van de prijspositioneringsstrategie bij albert heijn de voedselprijsinflatie het afgelopen kwartaal slechts ten dele doorberekend aan de klant
8505016 in de verenigde staten strekt het value improvement program zich behalve tot prijspositionering nu ook uit tot marketing en branding
8505017 wij zijn ervan overtuigd dat we het evenwicht tussen omzetgroei en marge zullen bewaren en onze prognose voor de onderliggende retailmarge van 4 8 5 3 in 2008 realiseren
8505018 there was an opening and it was just a natural instinct
8505019 i ran because i felt a need to help it never entered my mind to retire
8505020 we just really felt that our views and our voices werent being heard on the national or state level
8505021 we really wanted to correct that it was our responsibility if we felt this way to do something about it
8505022 it was certainly the best experience you can get from a co op
8505023 i really thought of things in black and white conservatives are this and liberals are this
8505024 it really broke a lot of the molds i had created in my mind it really showed me that there are gray areas on every issue
8505025 i love to work with young people i like to hear their ideas the future leaders will come from our younger people
8505026 i think that the great thing about it is when you have a diverse group of people in the legislature it really exposes you to a lot of views and a lot of ideas
8505027 thats the way to figure out the best policy to really test everything i think its definitely a strength to have that diversity
8505028 we should probably not have spent the bubble that we received and waited for rainy days
8505029 we may not have been in the position that we are in today but because we are we have some difficult decisions to make
8505030 if you smoke you pay the tax if you dont you dont
8505031 cigarette smoking actually costs the state money so its something good to look at
8505032 thats just going to stop revenues from coming in because people will buy less
8505033 eating it at night versus other times of the day doesnt make a difference
8505034 nighttime is a time when people do mindless eating because they are bored or tired
8505035 he told me that the electricity had been shut off just in his room nowhere else
8505036 he was talking to me when they came to arrest him
8505037 go home and listen to music and then take a nap or watch tv
8505038 go for a long walk or a run on the track
8505039 whip out my razorback defense takes strides as season opener nears
8505040 it is absolute madness in the car industry there are more and more joint ventures only in formula one do we all try to reinvent the wheel
8505041 i dont see many people interested in our gearbox or our suspension or our brakes
8505042 the world has changed we are in the entertainment business as well
8505043 desperate liberation into the creation of an eclectic yet highly personal recording
8505044 the reduction in the underlying business performance of the gold coast parks can mostly be attributed to extended poor weather which covered all the major trading periods for the year including january school holidays

8505047 in other months microsoft hasnt been as high certainly not in the top advertiser spot
8505048 yahoo and fox interactive may have been in different positions but both have been in the top two
8505049 weve done campaigns in 50 plus countries in 30 different languages its a whole different complexity when you deal with different languages different currencies
8505050 its part of our identity it says something about being bold upfront being brilliant
8505051 i encourage that here i dont let anyone get on a client call without at least one brilliant idea that hasnt been presented before
8505052 i like stimulation all day i want to be in provocative client meetings that make you think
8505053 delegate the things that other people can do better than me
8505054 we dont have layers and layers of management by design
8505055 whether or not that contributed to our success i dont know
8505056 the indian skipper not only handled the team well but also showed how top class spinners have to be played he played two knocks in this tournament which should never be forgotten he showed everyone how ajantha mendis has to be tackled
8505057 i expected the team to score 20 or 30 runs more i was not happy with the way in form raina got out with the form that he is in he should have gone on to get a hundred i think the boys were at least 20 to 30 runs short but the bowlers did a splendid job to defend the total
8505058 the rest helped him to approach the odi series in a fresh mind the break must have helped him a lot he was very clear in his thinking and led superbly
8505059 it is a big achievement to beat sri lanka at their own den this is an outstanding stuff because the manner in which they did it was really splendid as they came back from being 0 1 down to win the series 3 1
8505060 ive had more people ask me about recycling in the past six months than in my first four years as mayor so obviously people are more aware and interested
8505061 we have a duty to watch the bottom line but this may be a case where the more responsible thing is to look beyond it id be very surprised if recycling doesnt happen in this administration
8505062 for a while there was some talk about recycling with modern disposal but it died for a lack of interest
8505063 people were really comforted by the fact that we were all over the place
8505064 that is almost like having an extra couple of guys
8505065 it was really nice thing to have there it would help us localize any problems
8505066 it was mostly a family event you didnt see a lot of young single men or women going in in large groups
8505067 over and above the music it was a great social thing like a giant class reunion
8505068 there was a broad range of people out there babies teenagers and their parents even 70 year olds and everybody got along i think people are gonna be bummed out this friday
8505069 by voting they have ensured that tiger airways gives our customers the route network they want
8505070 traditionally many of the people of south australia who have wanted to join an airline as a flight attendant have had to pursue their career interstate due to limited opportunities
8505071 this is a significant milestone and for the rest of your life you can reflect with pride on your perseverance and dedication in completing your high school requirements

8505282 individuals have raised with me the subject of pay hikes around the province
8505283 weve got a lot of work to do explaining our policies to the public
8505284 were pleased with the recognition but we have a lot of work to do
8505285 we have to show theres an alternative to this government
8505286 it happened on a friday afternoon on the opening day of the beijing olympics they wanted to hide it the government believed it could get away with anything
8505287 it confirms a growing notion that the campbell administration has started becoming arrogant
8505288 the numbers indicate a significant shift until june the liberals had a 10 point spread
8505289 we know the ndp opposes everything what do they actually stand for
8505290 their carbon tax proposal is the most disingenuous document ive seen in 30 years of politics
8505291 get over his fixation on climate change and address the economy
8505292 the party that emerges will be the one which is seen to address economic issues people dont want to be told that forestry is dependent on a global market and nothing can be done
8505293 shes steady and calm which seems to be quite effective
8505294 for the first time the ndp is a real threat to the liberals
8505295 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8505296 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8505297 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8505298 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8505299 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8505300 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example
8505301 im familiar with most of the terminology because we ran the same things in toronto when coach miller was there bishop said
8505302 if i get an opportunity to play this week i might get about 40 or 50 plays they will give a package that i will feel comfortable with that i have to get used to where the receivers are going to be and when to run with the ball
8505303 what michael brings is some mobility like the younger guys we have lapolice said
8505304 hes going to create some points with his legs and with only two downs in this league you need that
8505305 hes going to bring a lot of positive energy palmer said
8505306 hes a tremendous athlete who can stretch a defence with his arm
8505307 i was upset because they werent being honest with me in toronto bishop said

8505313 it strikes terror into the heart of every mother paralyzes the best of teachers antagonizes even good natured babysitters
8505314 its particularly frustrating after all the money weve lavished on summer camp the latest computer games the newest toys
8505315 could this be why more mundane activities are boring theyve been desensitized with so much of the latest gadgets and technology that traditional activities just do not suffice
8505316 do our kids see us flit from project to project unable to sit down and really see something through to the end excited by the vision and not the nitty gritty work
8505317 if our children see us enthralled with everyday vistas and experiences they will learn to do the same
8505318 why did i not love this place when i lived here
8505319 the spectators were all dressed in white hooded robes woven of some gauzy material almost like ragged shrouds wrapped tightly around them

8505357 the reduction in the underlying business performance of the gold coast parks can mostly be attributed to extended poor weather which covered all the major trading periods for the year including january school holidays

8505359 the process in selecting a v p is one that john mccain is keeping very close to his chest
8505360 hes a person i have a lot of confidence in i think hes going to do the right thing
8505361 its an honor to have your name mentioned or something like that
8505362 to paraphrase mae west sometimes a vacation is just a vacation hes just on vacation
8505363 the general nature of the boards travel policies have allowed for excessive or imprudent expenses to go unquestioned
8505364 this is a very eye opening report for me to see and shocking in some respects
8505365 almost everything in the report and all the recommendations are reasonable common sense things that should be in our policy
8505366 we always welcome an extra set of eyes to look at what we do and how we do it
8505367 if we can improve from that thats a good thing
8505368 there doesnt seem to be a lot of room for discussion or debate
8505369 i think there is some positive news that comes from this today
8505370 whats noteworthy about this poll is how deep the support for proposition 8 goes
8505371 the fundamental question here is are we going to eliminate the fundamental right of marriage for same sex couples
8505372 no camp received 1 million from equality california a major gay rights organization
8505373 its beginning to be recognized it has to be part of our partys dialogue
8505374 the government must not hastily push through the passage of the bill
8505375 i have sufficient information that gives me reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8505376 i dont think since brown v board of education in 1954 will there be one singular moment that will make a bigger difference in race relations in this country than when on november the 4th we elect barack obama
8505377 those two people in one single year are going to make a bigger difference for our country in what they have done in what they have gone through in these campaigns in how they have debated these issues in how they are going to lead us to a great victory
8505378 weve got the best delegation weve ever had at a democratic national convention
8505379 he came in here yesterday and stepped up and really created more momentum for bruce lunsford by endorsing him
8505380 im very comfortable that by getting people at a national level to pay attention to this race when it tightens down in the end well be able to get some support nationwide that will really help us
8505381 im very comfortable that by getting people at a national level to pay attention to this race when it tightens down in the end well be able to get some support nationwide that will really help us
8505382 this transaction if its successful will take the pressure off them
8505383 get much sympathy about that from the folks back home
8505384 the gold coast is a vitally important region for football
8505385 it is one of the fastest growing regions in the country with a population already over half a million and a strong level of participation and interest in the sport
8505386 we know that the people of the gold coast enjoy supporting local teams and i have no doubt skilled park will be one of the best home grounds in the country
8505387 having a local team will also help encourage talented young players from the region as it gives them a clear pathway into australias premier competition
8505388 north queensland has met all the commercial criteria we set for them last month including local community and business support which has been terrific
8505389 like the gold coast north queensland people are very proud of their local teams
8505390 we know that there are many people in the city of townsville and beyond who are looking forward to the hyundai a league being part of the north queensland sporting landscape
8505391 north queensland has a fine record of producing outstanding home grown players and having a local hyundai a league team will be another impetus to encourage more talented young footballers
8505392 he echoed the ffas earlier view that ultimately the hyundai a league has the capacity to be at least a 12 team competition and possibly 14 teams
8505393 this extra package is a clear indication that we are continuing and reinforcing our commitment to the palestinian people

8505395 it is very much down to the economic climate as the strategic importance of it is linked to business

8505397 senior stakeholders are now less confident about making a move to another company

8505402 we are bombarded every day with calls from vendors offering the latest and greatest in green it but many do not even know what the requirements are and it managers have nothing by which to judge their products
8505403 suppliers are no longer using green hype in that sinister and negative way that they used to
8505404 even though their understanding of what actually makes a difference in terms of environmental impact is still basic i have noticed that there has been a step change in the market
8505405 by being green you can look good and save money so having it that is environmentally friendly is not just a trend anymore it is a real need
8505406 people are aware of the potential benefits in terms of cost savings the environmental effect and enhancements to the companys reputation but many are in the early stages of adoption and do not know how to manage the transition
8505407 it directors tend to take responsibility for green it rather than a sustainability director or somebody outside it firms are trusting their it guys to come up with environmental directives

8505426 what we came up with is a way to save and salvage the private property rights of the cobbs as well as pleasing the community by saving the property and preserving its heritage
8505427 this does not mean that some individual cant come in and just purchase the property to restore it themselves

8505534 we dont forecast the ports our ships are going to be pulling into
8505535 the ships are performing duties on maintaining peace and stability in abkhazia and in the republics territorial waters
8505536 among the duties we are performing is control over abkhazias territorial waters and the prevention of the trafficking in arms we are also carrying out a humanitarian mission
8505537 i decry racism and anti semitism in every form and strongly condemn the anti semitic statements made by minister farrakhan
8505538 i assume that trumpet magazine made its own decision to honor farrakhan based on his efforts to rehabilitate ex offenders but it is not a decision with which i agree
8505539 rev dr jeremiah a wright jr lifetime achievement trumpeteer award
8505540 when minister louis farrakhan speaks america listens for his commitment to truth education and leadership we honor minister louis farrakhan with the rev jeremiah w wright jr lifetime achievement award
8505541 reality imposes on human beings the necessity of renunciation of pleasures
8505542 in the new freudian perspective the essence of society is repression of the individual the essence of the individual is repression of the self
8505543 we obtain our theory of the unconscious from the theory of repression
8505544 im already looking forward to how the lies perpetrated by lip ic who has some psychological issues and was going to hockey matches with the alleged mafia boss jozef svoboda will come to light
8505545 immediately after i learned about his svobodas presence from my bodyguards i left and later on i wrote a letter to the then slovak ambassador to the czech republic complaining about the presence of persons suspected of criminal activities in seats assigned to slovak officials
8505546 the case is 14 years old and we have said everything that is to be said about it
8505547 according to current estimates the costs related to the second capitalised retirement savings pillar will contribute positively to the public finances balance by 0 1 percent of gdp due to increased one off transfer of resources by those savers who moved from the second pillar back to the first
8505548 organising the meeting offers a unique opportunity to present slovakia not only within nato but also within the wider euro atlantic context
8505549 anyone who fights for the future lives in it today
8505550 revolutions are the periods of history when individuals count most
8505551 theres a fine line between fishing and just standing on the shore like an idiot
8505552 president barack obama will restore the might of the military
8505553 because the republican party that i once knew has become something different something that i no longer even recognize the grand old party the grand old party is no longer grand its just old the same old failed policies the same old washington culture
8505554 weve always felt this was a county issue unfortunately because these folks are outside our jurisdiction we were limited in our options
8505555 our communities are interested in it but weve got to keep that interest going
8505556 its also scoping out the job its basically putting a design together
8505557 if you dont jump on it youre going to lose to someone else
8505558 if senator mccain continues to be the schmuck hes being were going to play there you know and go tell some truth
8505559 the national polls dont matter to us we dont look at them in chicago we focus on the 18 states we have to have to win this election
8505560 we care more about the entusiasm gap in the campaign in the daily polling than we do the head to head

8505600 we want to create a world class education system and make college affordable again to fight for an america that is defined by deep and meaningful equality from civil rights to labor rights from women s rights to gay rights
8505601 now senator obama s life is a 21st century incarnation of the old fashioned american dream his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the more perfect union of our founders dreams
8505602 weve reached the point where everything that needs to be said has been said but not everyone who needs to say it has said it
8505603 shes representative of what happens to the patients we see
8505604 i was in pain i had bad depression i was irritable i lost my mom when i was 3 and i worried that history was repeating itself
8505605 over half the women weve seen had seen over three different doctors before an fsh test was ordered
8505606 it takes some out of the box thinking in that 15 minute window
8505607 the health care community needs to be more aware of this
8505608 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
8505609 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost
8505610 i paid the bills whether i ate or didnt whether i went to the doctor or not

8505615 if nine of us are arrested you must continue to rally here
8505616 its our victory that police did not storm and arrest us last night
8505617 at this moment there are more than 10 000 protesters inside
8505618 they will prepare documents and hopefully by early afternoon police will enter government house with a court injunction and arrest warrants to meet with protest leaders
8505619 get much sympathy about that from the folks back home
8505620 and thank you for calling me mr president even though i am no longer in office i am still entitled to that
8505621 id like to introduce you to my daughter isabella rosselini
8505622 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8505623 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the north pole area right now is covered with very thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8505624 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8505625 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the arctic ocean in summer by 2030 or so
8505626 a violent education corporal punishment of children in u s public schools
8505627 african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population
8505628 by exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more
8505629 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
8505630 what made me so angry hes 3 years old he was petrified he didnt want to go back to school and he didnt want to start his new school
8505631 in short the longer the election protest cases remain unsolved and the longer the cases drag on our day to day operations will remain affected thus hampering delivery of basic services to our people
8505632 det er dybt bet nkeligt m leudstyret bliver kontrolleret efter tysk lov som er b de utilg ngelig og ufor st elig dermed kan man reelt ikke fort lle borgerne hvilke regler der g lder for automatisk trafikkontrol

8505635 i cried all night im going to be crying for the next four years
8505636 what barack obama has accomplished is the single most extraordinary event that has occurred in the 232 years of the nations political history the event itself is so extraordinary that another chapter could be added to the bible to chronicle its significance
8505637 as an elected leader of the african national congress i want to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past
8505638 in addition the exit of white persons who had a contribution to make from the civil service followed an unfortunate course that resulted in a skills vacuum in some areas of the public service
8505639 it is something that we aim to correct over time to ensure that those experts who can add substantial value to public service delivery will be given a chance to return and make the contribution they were trained to do
8505640 it is not only in the public service where white and black south africans have worked side by side to make south africa a better place to live
8505641 we should emulate the example of nelson mandela and reach deeply across divides to ensure that we search for the very best in one another

8505767 esto va mas all de la propia legislaci n del distrito federa lo que estaba en juego era un proceso de despenalizaci n que esperamos suceda en varios estados de la rep blica creo que lo que estaban esperando era la resoluci n de la corte el criterio jur dico se proyectara a las dem s estatidades por el bien de las mujeres de m xico
8505768 sin duda podr a presentarse de nuevo si un estado lo hace pero yo creo que la corte se sostendr a como en la primera postura
8505769 tienen argumentos yo creo que hemos visto una discusi n nutrida han tenido un comportamiento jur dico predominante no he visto que se hayan vertido argumentos religiosos o morales y lo puso muy en claro el propio ministro aguirre desde el primer d a aunque l no concordaba con la postura m s liberar de los 8 ministros que votaron en su contra
8505770 la ley queda tal y como esta y se aplica como esta jur dicamente no hay mayor variaci n como el proyecto del ministro aguirre no fue avalada por la mayor a ahora procede que el ministro presidente nombre a un redactor de lo que ser a la sentencia alternativa ya avalada por los ocho ministros y a partir de eso ya se podr an generar las tesis de jurisprudencia que fijaron los criterios que regir an hacia el futro en este tema
8505771 lo que veremos ma ana es la votaci n en donde se definir con claridad c mo queda la distribuci n de votos entre cada uno de los 11 ministros
8505772 yo creo que con esto podemos decir que m xico se suma a una corriente internacional no es que sea el primer pa s del mundo que avala la despenalizaci n del aborto en los 70 se discuti en estados unidos en los 80 en espa a y alemania y hace cuatro a os en colombia todas les resoluciones fueron en el mismo sentido de despenalizarla esto es a favor de los derechos de las mujeres
8505773 con despenalizar el aborto no se soluciona el problema de fondo que son los embarazos no deseados sobre todo en los adolescentes todav a existe la falta de una educaci n sexual y que los j venes sigan viendo estos temas como tab esto tendr que ser atendido desde una pol tica p blica que comprometa informaci n desde la familia hasta la educaci n

8505784 to end it like that it was kind of i guess disappointing
8505785 he served right at me for sure yeah thats a good strategy sometimes
8505786 it was a bad miss but it was a miss that i hit pretty hard
8505787 i was just trying to tell myself to enjoy it

8505807 please stay away until the kane county health department issues their official findings
8505808 i clearly meant it solely as a fyi to my colleagues

8506878 furthermore when the two officers returned to their section steve who was still in the stadium overhead one of the officers say we got to watch ourselves
8506879 i do not believe in god nor am in support of this country to a degree of patriotic fanaticism the fact that i wanted to use the restroom instead of standing through god bless america should not be grounds for a forcible ejection from a baseball game
8506880 this tip doesnt surprise me at all everyone has to stand just like in school and youll get berated and harassed if you dont
8506881 some men see things as they are and say why
8506882 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of moral crisis preserved their neutrality
8506883 a fanatic is one who cant change his mind and wont change the subject
8506884 some men see things as they are and say why
8506885 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of moral crisis preserved their neutrality
8506886 i have sufficient information that gives me reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8506887 i am prepared to wait on the court steps for them and if they dont turn up they can go away for ever
8506888 the public was firstly told that mr peters had not received any money from mr glenn then the public was told that mr peters had in fact received a donation but had not known about it and then finally yesterday they were told that mr peters had personally solicited the donation
8506889 the public are entitled to know why she withheld this crucial information for so long
8506890 pretty much what he said in the letter to the privileges committee
8506891 as youd expect the first thing i did was go away and ring mr peters
8506892 its always seemed to me that somewhere someplace there must have been some kind of contribution but it wasnt clear where
8506893 mr peters of course is on the record that the first he knew of the donation to his legal expenses was july 18
8506894 ill be damned if i let another young person be sent to war and come home like this
8506895 it doesnt make any sense to have a timetable you know if you give a timetable youre youre conceding too much to the enemy
8506896 i think setting an artificial timetable for withdrawal is a significant mistake
8506897 it doesnt make any sense to have a timetable you know if you give a timetable youre youre conceding too much to the enemy

8506904 they know their friends and family they dont know the superrich some of this is curiosity some of it is envy some of it is jealousy some of it is snarkiness
8506905 its interesting because when you look at when shows like this were very popular dynasty and dallas back in the day they debuted when there were economic hard times
8506906 it is acceptable in popular culture to show a fantasy lifestyle contrary to what most people are experiencing think about the kind of escapist films produced during the great depression for instance on the other hand there is a fine balance that must be struck so that the public is not pushed into scoffing at or rejecting portrayals of wealth
8506907 you want to make sure that youre not alienating a lot of viewers across the country who might be in tough financial situations

8506943 the major league baseball players association today filed a grievance challenging the unilateral decision of the commissioners office to extend the august 15 2008 signing deadline for drafted players

8506946 i have read the statement issued by frank coonelly president of the pittsburgh pirates regarding pedro alvarez
8506947 at the heart of the matter is oil and land
8506948 mindanao land houses some of the largest oil and natural gas deposits in the asia pacific region multinational corporate interest to acquire and control these reserves has been the real reason for armed conflict in the mindanao area with increased u s and philippine militarization and foreign mining and land grabbing for decades not religious conflict or terrorism as projected by malaca ang philippine presidential palace or the u s government
8506949 the u s government is also notorious in its history of annihilation and genocide of the indigenous peoples of north america and repression against racial minorities it cannot be sincere in building peace with or conceding to the aspirations of bangsamoro people just look at its track record
8506950 by issuing a bogus memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain the arroyo clique is shamelessly and covertly pushing to change the philippine constitution there is no intention to cultivate peace with the people of mindanao on arroyos part as an abuse of her executive powers arroyos provisions with the blessing of the u s government will include an extension of her unpopular dictatorial term
8506951 the fact that the coalition forces again martyred 80 people including women children and men in an arbitrary military operation
8506952 shows that contrary to our peoples expectations the role of these forces has now shifted from ensuring security to taking the lives of civilians the coalition forces have repeatedly carried out uncoordinated military operations in different parts of the country and caused civilian casualties
8506953 the americans are foreigners and they do not understand these people they killed were enemies of the taliban new york times aug 23 while the nato war in afghanistan is supposedly against the taliban its neocolonial character is becoming clearer every day
8506954 responsible for the death of these 10 men of my husband
8506955 for me we have nothing to do in afghanistan it is necessary to let them fight it out among themselves

8506971 i have sufficient information that gives me reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8506972 i am prepared to wait on the court steps for them and if they dont turn up they can go away for ever
8506973 the public was firstly told that mr peters had not received any money from mr glenn then the public was told that mr peters had in fact received a donation but had not known about it and then finally yesterday they were told that mr peters had personally solicited the donation
8506974 the public are entitled to know why she withheld this crucial information for so long
8506975 pretty much what he said in the letter to the privileges committee
8506976 as youd expect the first thing i did was go away and ring mr peters
8506977 its always seemed to me that somewhere someplace there must have been some kind of contribution but it wasnt clear where
8506978 mr peters of course is on the record that the first he knew of the donation to his legal expenses was july 18
8506979 we offer sto hd to all of our affiliates directv has decided to only carry our live hd indians games sto began broadcasting sto hd full time 24 7 on april 1st directv did announce that they will be offering 30 more hd channels in august to their subscribers unfortunately they informed us that sto hd was not one of them we expressed our disappointment with this decision
8506980 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements
8506981 he would say this is how its going to be going forward
8506982 it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8506983 the office has assured us that we have a valid contract with pedro and that it will vigorously defend any claim to the contrary
8506984 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more to his liking
8506985 the pirates violated major league baseball rules and have issued a nearly 600 word statement to make their actions out to be my fault i think its time for the pirates and mr coonelly to come clean with the fans of pittsburgh and let everyone know about their dealings with pedro alvarez
8506986 willing and ready to pay pedro a 6 million signing bonus
8506987 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract
8506988 despite our disappointment we continue to believe in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8506989 we will sit down with pedro and his family as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and much more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8506990 they are great test takers and they produce a large number of engineers and scientists
8506991 but its a system that doesnt put up with creative people look at me i ran away all the creative people come to the united states or other countries

8506996 his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the worlds creation onward because they are perceived by the things made even his eternal power and godship so that they are inexcusable
8506997 its no longer just ive known this guy for five years and we have a good relationship
8506998 you can see objectively how they perform the system helps people make sure they are paying the right people commissions
8506999 allows me to provide a nice concise thesis and it allows me to track my returns from when i input the idea to when i close it out im able to gauge how well im doing with regard to my idea flow and hopefully the clients are doing the same
8507000 this eliminates face to face verbal communication with clients that really allows you to build rapport with the clients
8507001 portfolio managers are only concerned about returns but there is still a trust factor that needs to be built in with any buy sell side relationship and i find that at the beginning this system ignores that fact
8507002 i try not to speculate and think about that too much i just try to keep my head clear and concentrate on practice ive been going hard at it during exhibition games on special teams it hasnt been mistake free but im just trying to go hard and get better every chance i get
8507003 i think physically im up to speed with the other guys
8507004 i can match the defensive backs its just that from a technical point of view theres a lot of work i have to do things like the way i run my routes also we run a lot of no huddle where we try to see what the defence is doing and adjust a lot of the routes i run will change depending on the defence thats something ive never had to do before
8507005 we had lunch and i told him you look like a cow on the side of the road and youre giving that impression youve got to play through that
8507006 but hes shown his athletic ability and speed and i think hes got a chance
8507007 the whole thing when he went down there is he can catch the ball jump and i mean jump with a 42 inch vertical jump and run
8507008 and hes not a pipsqueak so thats given him a head start you look at federkeil whos now coming into his own and you see it takes some time to learn
8507009 war veterans who are custodians of the countrys revolution welcome the convening of parliament set for next week
8507010 the west had engineered an impasse in the talks so that their preferred leader takes over
8507011 that is a condition that will never happen a step that will never be taken by zanu pf as a party of the people of zimbabwe
8507012 returned to libya with a delegation of chiefs who were invited to take part in the 39th anniversary of the great libyan revolution to be celebrated in september
8507013 we strongly stand with the people of zimbabwe and their political leadership in the fight against imperialism
8507014 the president comrade robert mugabe is one of the people who brought independence to zimbabwe and he is a liberation hero
8507015 we therefore understand him when he says he does not want outside meddling in the talks
8507016 the idea of power sharing is an african solution to african problems africa does not want to be dictated to and the people should come first
8507017 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8507018 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8507019 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business in iraq but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else then thats where we need to be

8507027 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8507028 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8507029 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8507030 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8507031 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8507067 we heard there was a hit and run in wakefield but we had no idea it was her
8507068 she was sweet she was loving she loved dogs she loved to dance
8507069 we are determined to locate and identify those responsible for this terrible tragedy
8507070 what we saw here was a multifaceted extortion plot with a number of moving parts
8507071 it was planned it was orchestrated and it could very well have turned deadly
8507072 jacques arrived home appearing neither surprised nor upset at the condition of her apartment
8507073 she liked to think of herself as a straightforward sort of person people always know where they are with me she would say rather smugly it never occurred to her that people might not always want to know such things

8507083 that just looks bad like im not focusing on baseball but kathy said no its not an endorsement its not because of who you are or that you play baseball this is a modeling gig
8507084 i had my guitar in the shot so he thought i was a musician someone told him i was a baseball player he said whatever he is it doesnt matter we need this guy for the campaign so i did an eight hour shoot in malibu on an off day in june
8507085 whats great is that they dont want my name zito said
8507086 im just strictly a model who knows maybe itll open up other doors its always fun to be involved in different things
8507087 my dream is complete hitting my first home run that was the best moment i thought it had a chance because that was the best pitch i had to hit he threw a good game and made two mistakes
8507088 hes doing a great job its funny we have the same numbers its great to be there now but you kind of look at where you are at the end of the season and gauge from that
8507089 we checked on him going into the eighth and he said i feel great

8507321 i dont understand why no one would do anything about it seems like code enforcement somebody would get on top of things and the 7 lives have been lost would have been saved by now
8507322 i didnt like it i dont think the mud slinging helps anything
8507323 thats not my character not my type of stance to fold the tent and go home
8507324 as sons sometimes do we dont listen to our parents but after we had time to sit back and reflect as usual dad was right
8507325 for the first time in 17 years congressman childers has to take a stand on issues these issues will show where we differ
8507326 we dont need him to tell us whats wrong with travis or travis childers telling us whats wrong with greg we need to know what the good points are for both of em and what they can do for the congressional district
8507327 the board is having a meeting in the morning to sit down with the president and figure out how to get this behind us
8507328 at the pirates request the office of the commissioner today placed pedro alvarez on major league baseballs restricted list
8507329 the major league rules provide that a player who refuses to sign a uniform player contract to which he has agreed and report to the signing club shall upon a report of the signing club be placed on the restricted list until he signs a contract reflecting the terms to which he has agreed
8507330 the pirates are confident that the contract reached with pedro alvarez was agreed to and submitted to major league baseball in a timely fashion and properly accepted by major league baseball
8507331 the pirates made several attempts to commence negotiations immediately following the draft and were willing and ready to agree to pay pedro a 6 million signing bonus from the very outset

8507333 im going to force myself to write no matter what
8507334 an experienced writer possesses the skill set to produce words but the ability to create is not always present
8507335 id spent 10 years in italy and i learnt a lot there
8507336 im happy that i started my career in that country but it was just getting a little bit stale there
8507337 italy is still an important country to play in but the english premier league had something special that i wanted to be involved in
8507338 id made up my mind to leave italy obviously it wasnt that simple but blackburn made an important offer and im happy to be here
8507339 theres a certain enthusiasm about all the stadiums of england the way that the people enjoy their football
8507340 i think the clubs have invested a lot of money in bringing in the top players and they have improved the football as a consequence
8507341 it is an enthusiastic league to watch the opportunity was there and i thought it would be good to measure myself against such a good league
8507342 i look forward to returning to seattle after my surgery to cheer on the storm
8507343 im disappointed that i wont be able to finish out the regular season but i have confidence in my teammates im hopeful that i can rejoin them for the wnba finals
8507344 weve been playing the last six plus weeks without lauren in practice and in games
8507345 i think shes a very confident person she wants to help our team you know shes going to do everything she can to make it happen whether it can happen thats debatable
8507346 its been two years since i played for this team and i cant believe im here after two weeks of watching the absolute best basketball in the world im excited to play
8507347 id like to think that people would think of me as a good servant of the richmond football club and a good quality player that has done his best for richmond
8507348 my form has been pretty good this year so im not going to cancel out a chance of going on next year ill put my hat in the ring and see what happens
8507349 i have been here for a while and only the last two years i have been playing regular first grade
8507350 there are some guys leaving next year and i would like to push for a run on spot thats what my personal goal is
8507351 there doesnt appear to be any catalyst for the gains
8507352 market breadth is positive although conviction behind the market is unclear
8507353 working at the intersection of the business cultural and philanthropy sectors bringing design thinking and design processes to a host of social and environmental challenges
8507354 is there a definitive canadian style in our graphic design
8507355 while customers are already familiar with ninjaprobes wire speed traffic capture capabilities our addition of synchronized traffic replay even across multiple probes adds a new dimension to network monitoring and trouble shooting
8507356 after precisely time stamping every captured packet ninjaprobe can now accurately replay stored data while maintaining inter packet delay intervals guaranteeing recreation of the originally monitored traffic
8507357 high volume data storage coupled to accurate data replay is the equivalent of network cctv giving operators the reassurance that they can readily share a previous user experience and quickly isolate issues that might be impacting network performance
8507358 we operate on three continents and our business is undergoing enormous growth it would be impossible to predict future systems and infrastructure requirements for our business with netsuite oneworld we dont have to
8507359 we look forward to continuing to use the services of first hosted ltd for continued training for our organisation and we would recommend them to everyone netsuite the product like first hosted ltd is top class
8507360 netsuite allows us to focus on what actually generates income for our business and that is spending time with our customers
8507361 having everything operating on a single platform is highly efficient our online stores outsourced warehousing facilities delivery and dispatch system and shipping are fully integrated with ups and our payment processing with paypal dramatically reducing investment on overhead
8507362 netsuite gives us the flexibility to meet our future needs whatever they are with little or no effort and minimum cost with netsuite we must have saved in excess of 50 000 in computer hardware and infrastructure alone and at least as much again in salaries and fees for maintenance and support
8507363 you should do well at making money and holding on to it
8507364 any doubts that you may have will disappear early this month
8507365 get your mind set confidence will lead you on to success
8507366 what the mind can concieve and believe it can achieve
8507367 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the
8507368 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8507369 when we screened all the raw footage before starting to edit we were pleased to find we had more than a fashion movie on our hands
8507370 the result i hope is a dramatic story about a master confronting the final act of his celebrated career
8507371 the movie in certain ways thanks almost entirely to its stars plays more like a feature film than a documentary
8507372 im going to have some more tests when i get back to australia
8507373 i feel okay at the moment but i get worn out easily my swing hasnt been great since loch lomond the week before the british open in july
8507374 this has been a bit of a crazy year the last six months over the last few months with illness and injury i just havent been able to put the work in and my games suffering a bit
8507375 i would like to have worked on it in akron at the bridgestone invitational and didnt get the opportunity i tried to work on it at the pga and didnt get it done
8507376 the gold coast is a vitally important region for football
8507377 it is one of the fastest growing regions in the country with a population already over half a million and a strong level of participation and interest in the sport
8507378 we know that the people of the gold coast enjoy supporting local teams and i have no doubt skilled park will be one of the best home grounds in the country
8507379 having a local team will also help encourage talented young players from the region as it gives them a clear pathway into australias premier competition
8507380 this is absolutely tremendous news for the gold coast ffa has worked with us tirelessly to finalise our bid and to get this club up and running we thank them for their diligence and attention throughout the process
8507381 this is a fantastic outcome and we couldnt be happier and it is only the beginning of what is an exciting new era for football on the gold coast
8507382 north queensland has met all the commercial criteria we set for them last month including local community and business support which has been terrific
8507383 like the gold coast north queensland people are very proud of their local teams we know that there are many people in the city of townsville and beyond who are looking forward to the hyundai a league being part of the north queensland sporting landscape
8507384 considering the squad that weve had for both of our opening games with a wee bit of luck we could have won both games and could be sitting top of the hyundai a league
8507385 there have been a lot of positives to come out of both games pedj bojic has been outstanding boogaard is back now matt simon is back and doing well petrovski is doing well and caceres and elrich are getting better with every game
8507386 it looks like jedinak and macallister will be up for selection on sunday as we said in the first week of the season itll take us about two or three weeks for our squad to get bigger which puts more pressure on players to perform which is what its all about
8507387 you cant leave your run in the hyundai a league for too long weve got a full year to plan for with the afc champions league to come and its very important that we start getting results
8507388 going to queensland this weekend will be very hard we saw at the weekend that they totally dominated adelaide and theyre very hard to play against at suncorp stadium
8507389 since i came to australia ive been coming and watching and supporting glory
8507390 theyve been one of the best teams in the league back in the day so i want to see that happen again
8507391 it would mean a lot for the club and for perth its been such a great club and its still a great club and hopefully it will be one of the best in australia again
8507392 its hard to fathom that there is something out there like this for children to access so freely
8507393 blah blah blah blah we dont want to parent our kids cause thats too much work so someone should do it for us blah blah blah blah blah
8507394 the main reason santa is so jolly is because he knows where all the bad girls live
8507395 on a long enough timeline the survival rate for everyone drops to zero
8507396 suicide in a video game o 0 parents should be keeping their kids away from second life because its explicitly for users 18 and older thats clear all over the website and you have to supply a birthday to register if you register an age under 18 youre given the link to teen second life you can obviously put a fake one in and get access that way but then youre lying and really its on parents to watch and monitor what their kids are doing not punishing other companies by demanding they take care of kids that arent their own it is not inherently adult either but the content is resident generated and like the internet in general a lot of that takes the form of sexual content youporn and xtube and so on are a lot easier if kids just want to get free adult material and those dont validate ages either
8507397 im probably more excited than maybe i used to be by getting to the third round
8507398 but i feel when im in a tournament and im competing and im healthy that i should be winning some of these matches so im happy to be in the third round but im still looking for more
8507399 i have to be realistic in my mind and just be ecstatic to be playing here
8507400 it was only when i got back from china maybe last saturday that i was able to start practicing for singles so to expect i would be out here and be perfect is probably shooting for the stars a little bit too much
8507401 i felt it was a little bit tough for me to get much rhythm out there
8507402 i dont feel like im that far off davenport said

8507406 everyone got ungodly tax benefits and credits and then walked away from it
8507407 the city of oakland has a vested interest in having a successful low income housing program

8507468 the prime minister has lost the mandate of the country and the nation
8507469 i hope the member for permatang pauh will contribute to the proceedings of this house i am satisfied he has been unanimously appointed leader of the opposition
8507470 i would like to welcome the member for permatang pauh who is back in the house after a second political tsunami the government is like the titanic which is going to sink
8507471 there is no threat from anwar he has won in a by election and he becomes just another mp
8507472 since the march 8 elections till now we have done nothing but politicking but the defections havent happened they are waiting for it to happen but it hasnt happened good luck to them
8507473 if nine of us are arrested you must continue to rally here
8507474 its our victory that police did not storm and arrest us last night
8507475 at this moment there are more than 10 000 protesters inside
8507476 they will prepare documents and hopefully by early afternoon police will enter government house with a court injunction and arrest warrants to meet with protest leaders
8507477 were back to playing the footy that we like to play and that is intimidating teams putting the pressure on and making the most of the turnovers
8507478 were just playing as a team and not relying on too many individuals
8507479 we can finish top four but freo have got a lot of blokes that are retiring so theyre going to be out to beat us as well
8507480 ive been in that position before where collingwood was down the bottom of the ladder and youre playing just to knock a team off and wreck their finals chances so theyll be fired up so its a matter of us taking them on early
8507481 hes obviously just walking at this stage but hell have a long break
8507482 its not always wise to start someone in that situation when the games very intense
8507483 but to come off the bench hed be pretty good the two strikers were probably the two outstanding players last week
8507484 its important we find out exactly where were at at this stage of the season
8507485 theyve changed their formation virtually every game ive seen them play in the pre season and the first two rounds
8507486 i would say garys either trying to change a couple of things so all we can do is focus on what we do well
8507487 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8507488 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out for the last seven years this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century
8507489 the emergence of russia china and india as great powers the spread of lethal weapons
8507490 and the resurgence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front against terrorism
8507491 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8507492 we cannot afford four more years like the past eight years
8507493 policies that embolden our enemies undermine our economy and place an unfair burden on the heroes of our armed forces john mccain asks that we trust republicans to safeguard our national security to which we can only reply why would we
8507494 so who can we trust to keep america safe the mccain bush republicans have been wrong again and again and again
8507495 with america fighting two wars the 9 11 terrorists still at large iran pursuing nuclear weapons and russia in georgia america needs a president who gets it right first time
8507496 the administration of george bush supported by john mccain every step of the way has let our warriors down
8507497 our troops are courageous strong and fierce this administration has re deployed them until they are overstretched stressed and strained
8507498 thats what ive told adelaide director of football michael petrillo
8507499 hes a fantastic professional fantastic footballer and is extremely good within the group and a good natured person so for me hes got to stay i spoke to him even today
8507500 i also understand hes a footballer who wants to do the best for himself and his family
8507501 weve been in that situation before so any decision he makes is solely for himself and i understand that but in my opinion cassios a player here for the long term
8507502 agos fine he probably was ready last week but we were a bit precautionary with him
8507503 the happiest people dont necessarily have the best of everything hard drives
8507504 there will be a change or two from the team that played last week but having said that only one or two because thats all weve got
8507505 we may well this week only have two emergencies thats where its at its difficult
8507506 through 17 players being out what weve found is guys have been given opportunities to play in different positions and guys are getting better looks in different positions
8507507 with that has come some confidence and a different angle to the team and in turn we are getting a different outlook on that particular player too
8507508 its given a lot of young players opportunities where it wouldnt have done in the past i think if anything its going to benefit the club going forward
8507509 we havent got a lot to play for we havent for a number of weeks but weve still been managing to play quite good football
8507510 under no circumstances during this year have we lost the spring in our step theyve been resilient
8507511 its six months before you get to play again so its all of those reasons why we will give it our all in the final game
8507512 the happiest people dont necessarily have the best of everything
8507513 the happiest people dont necessarily have the best of everything hard drives 2 wd velociraptor 300gb wd caviar black 1tb hmmm im in the market right now i wouldnt mind grabbing two of those to see if thats the real price in the middle of difficulty lies opportunity albert einstein dead rising saints row dead or alive 4 fight night round 3 ghost recon aw table tennis chromehounds condemned pgr3 rainbow six vegas lego star wars ii dirt gears of war kameo guitar hero ii halo 3 super paper mario metroid prime 3 mario galaxy zelda twilight princess ddr hottest party lego star wars wii fit brain age 2 zelda phantom hourglass super mario ds new super mario bros yoshis island ds kirby canvas curse meteos mario kart ds asphalt urban gt final fantasy iii my french coach sega master system sega genesis nes snes n64 gamecube gameboy xbox playstation 52

8507522 i wonder if the cat would notice if i used dryer lint instead of kitty litter since i have no litter but have a ton of lint
8507523 i wonder what would happen if you had a soccer mom girl scout leader who worked for the family business which is assassination
8507524 for one it was the first time getting all the reps with the first team instead of splitting them it feels a little different getting reps with those guys and knowing its my team

8507563 we were effective again this year and we really demonstrated improvement in different categories we either showed improvement or were above proficient in 26 of 30 indicators and met 26 of the 30 as well
8507564 about 85 percent of our students scored proficient or above so right now the district would probably be about a b or b were doing well and improving
8507565 three of our four buildings received an excellent rating franklin landeck and the high school the middle school did improve they just have a little further to go they especially showed improvement in 7th grade math going from 53 percent last year to 69 percent this year and in 8th grade social studies we went from 53 to 62 percent so well continue to work at these areas
8507566 we were at or above the state average in almost all the tests so im encouraged our teachers work very hard to align the curriculum to the standards and to become familiar with the tests and the testing process
8507567 our overall composite score was above expected growth the value added basically says ok this student should go from point a to point b and measures if they got there overall our students showed more than a years growth
8507568 i am pleased and quite proud we have received excellent status for the past seven years we have a history of providing a good education for our youngsters
8507569 this is the fourth year in a row weve been excellent and were working toward hitting all 30 indicators by departmentalizing this means weve restructured some things so one teacher teaches all the social studies for seventh and eighth grades and one teacher teaches all the science for example this is new for this year our kids are going above and beyond being proficient id say they and their parents and the staff working very hard is what has brought us to this point
8507570 im ecstatic on the excellent rating the new growth and valuable improvements were additions that were rewarded our goal is to achieve 30 indicators we were down from last year 26 down to 23
8507571 weve looked at the areas and grade levels and i think fifth grade was just a bump in the road for us this year but we went in over the summer and restructured how were teaching fifth grade
8507572 our eighth grade social studies has shown 13 percent growth and weve been very aggressive over the summer in the elementary area those teachers are very dedicated and are working very hard
8507573 we need to strive for improvement in all areas so we continue to improve because the bar keeps being raised our teachers have done a tremendous job of changing how they teach and what they teach to meet standards that are a moving target thats one of the problems the state can completely change its focus next year and we could be in trouble again as long as the state remains constant in what it expects from us we can deal with that but when it changes the rules of the game then it gets difficult
8507574 this is the eighth year in a row weve been either excellent or effective we made excellent one year three years ago this year if we had one more indicator or one more performance index point we would have reached excellent so were right there knocking at the door
8507575 obama is ready to raise taxes but hes not ready to lead

8507577 recent comprehensive and systematic reviews of the evidence show that food advertising affects what children eat what they prefer to eat and what they pester their parents for
8507578 the federal government needs to put in place legislation that protects children supports parents and does not undermine campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles
8507579 it is a shame that the revised standards have put broadcasters revenue before our childrens health
8507580 a national ban on junk food advertising during childrens tv viewing hours is a sensible first step in tackling childhood obesity

8507600 the refresh cycle were currently seeing in the midrange and high end segments is part of the it transformation cycle that is continuing as older scalable systems with 4 sockets 8 sockets or more are being replaced either by new scale up servers or by groups of scale out servers
8507601 the growth in midrange and high end servers this quarter shows that customers still see value in leveraging these scalable servers with built in high availability and ras features for some of their most mission critical workloads and for workload consolidation
8507602 ibm regained the top spot in unix market share on the strength of its power based system p and merged power systems families growing revenues nearly 25 7 in the quarter and gaining 5 1 percentage points in year over year comparisons
8507603 sun took second position with a 31 1 share posting a drop of 5 6 percentage points from a year ago and hp rounded out the top three with a 25 8 share and a gain of 1 percentage point overall the unix market remains a significant source of revenue and competition among the top three suppliers
8507604 while all the major vendors exhibited strong unit growth there was significant price competition throughout the quarter
8507605 low end volume servers such as 1 and 2 socket systems are somewhat viewed as commodities and experienced the most pricing pressure additionally the quarter was made noteworthy by the fact that several of the tier one vendors began shipping their new systems targeting large scale datacenters typically these are stripped down servers that are designed to operate at maximum power efficiency all components and features that are not essential including server redundancy are eliminated to reduce the capital expenditure of these datacenter customers

8507621 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8507622 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8507623 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells

8507630 un gobierno del oficialismo liberal que hoy se atreve a decir que este gobierno no tiene autoridad moral se al o con los pepes perseguidos por pablo escobar para perseguir a pablo escobar
8507631 me van a decir a m que no tengo autoridad moral para presentar la reforma pol tica y la reforma a la justicia cuando en el gobierno se han desmontado los paramilitares y se ha debilitado la guerrilla
8507632 lo que hay es una reacci n contra el tr fico de testigos a mi lo que me preocupa es que pareciera que pasa inadvertido que un magistrado de la corte haga tr fico con testigos y se emborrache con ellos d nde en el mundo democr tico se ve que los juristas de una corte se emborrachen con los testigos no se puede quedar el pa s tranquilo con esto
8507633 este gobierno con la pol tica de seguridad democr tica ha dado confianza para que se se ale a los delincuentes pero de all al tr fico de testigos no podemos pasar

8507670 abbiamo viaggiato insieme per il mondo un amicizia che va oltre la politica
8507671 sono profondamente in disaccordo con quanto vuole john per il nostro paese lui pensa che durante gli anni di bush abbiamo fatto grandi progressi economici io penso che siano stati pessimi in senato john stato dalla parte di bush il 95 per cento delle volte la scelta di questa elezione chiara questi tempi hanno bisogno di qualcosa di pi di un buon soldato
8507672 quando john propone duecento miliardi di tagli fiscali per la corporate america di cui un miliardo solo per le otto pi grandi aziende ma nessuno sgravio per cento milioni di famiglie americane questo non un cambiamento la stessa politica di sempre
8507673 milioni di posti di lavoro hanno lasciato i nostri confini ma john ha votato diciannove volte contro laumento del salario minimo per gente che combatte per arrivare al giorno dopo non un cambiamento sempre lo stesso
8507674 nel momento in cui siamo riuniti qui stasera il nostro paese meno sicuro ed isolato come non lo mai stato nella sua storia la politica estera di bush mccain ci ha fatto precipitare in un buco profondo con solo pochi amici disposti ad aiutarci negli ultimi sette anni questa amministrazione non stata in grado di affrontare le pi grandi forze che modellano questo secolo lemergere di russia cina ed india come grandi potenze la diffusione di armamenti letali la mancanza di energia acqua e cibo la sfida del cambiamento climatico il ritorno del fondamentalismo in pakistan e afghanistan il fronte centrale della lotta al terrorismo solo pochi giorni fa abbiamo avuto la prova delle conseguenze di questo fallimento nella sfida portata dalla russia contro la libera e democratica georgia
8507675 possiamo fidarci del giudizio di mccain quando dice che non si pu fissare un tempo per il ritiro dalliraq che dobbiamo restarci allinfinito o dobbiamo ascoltare obama che dice diamo la responsabilit agli iracheni e fissiamo una data per riportare le truppe a casa john mccain aveva torto barack obama aveva ragione

8507678 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
8507679 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8507680 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8507681 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8507682 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8507683 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8507684 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
8507685 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo
8507686 cesen los allanamientos y la militarizaci n de las comunidades mapuche
8507687 los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche
8507688 el ministerio del interior presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
8507689 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8507690 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8507691 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8507692 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8507693 no se ha registrado ratificaci n del convenio 169 por parte de chile en la oit chile no ha presentado los instrumentos de ratificaci n
8507694 todos los convenios de la oit sin excepci n no admiten ninguna reserva o declaraci n interpretativa
8507695 religiosity has also been associated with lower blood pressure lower cholesterol and even lower risk for colon cancer
8507696 people who attended religious services once a week had significantly lower risks of death compared with those who attended less frequently or never
8507697 we found this difference even after adjusting for factors such as social connections and health behaviors including smoking and exercising
8507698 people who profess stronger spiritual beliefs seem to resolve their grief more rapidly and completely after the death of a close person than do people with no spiritual beliefs
8507699 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas
8507700 in the outlying areas health services are maybe less available in a city the services are better such as local access to gps theres also a certain amount of social stigma attached to being obese it may be that these obese people are not going to see their gp however we need to bear in mind that some pcts are better at recording the data than others which could affect the results
8507701 victory is reserved for those who are willing to pay its price
8507702 if you cant change others change yourself if you cant change yourself kill yourself if you cant kill yourself kill others
8507703 a wide ranging story compelling characters and an intense real time battle system
8507704 poor tales even though its one of the longest running rpg series it has never really gotten much fame in north america
8507705 is this the effort to finally break it into the mainstream or will it be a forgotten and disappointing yarn
8507706 the first thing you notice when you start tales of vesperia is how beautiful its cel shaded graphics are
8507707 colors are incredibly vibrant and pop from your screen especially if youre playing on an hd monitor many of the environments are simply beautiful
8507708 the tales of vesperia battle system is nearly the same as the versions from tales of symphonia and tales of the abyss
8507709 when you approach an enemy instead of simply going into a turn based attack sequence the game becomes a real time fighting game
8507710 even though its not as deep as fighting games like soul calibur or tekken
8507711 tales of vesperia is a great way to kick off the tales series in this generation of gaming
8507712 the graphics are stunning the characters are interesting and the game is simply really fun to play hopefully this will be the game that gets the tales series noticed by people who think final fantasy vii was the last good rpg in gaming
8507713 longtime fans of the tales games will see much they are familiar with in tales of vesperia and newcomers to the series will get a solid introduction to what all the fuss is about
8507714 in bringing tales to current generation consoles namco tales studio stuck to most of the conventions it has created for the series over the years and added some new elements to spice things up a bit
8507715 because characters and enemies arent taking turns attacking battles are less about strategy and more about knowing your fighters moves chaining together combos and using special attacks at the right times
8507716 but just because battles are real time that doesnt mean theres no strategy involved each character in your party there can be four on the battlefield at a time can be custom tailored to fit your style
8507717 clearly tales isnt breaking any new ground in terms of story mysterious magic warring guilds and monster attacks have been staples of the genre for years
8507718 but beneath the surface tales of vesperia explores themes of corruption betrayal honor virtue and how quickly all the above can blend and heave when life hangs in the balance at times that exploration is handled clumsily in tales perhaps something is lost in translation but the overall effect is strong
8507719 tales of vesperia is a strong anime style japanese rpg with a wide ranging story compelling characters and an intense real time battle system that keeps you on your toes
8507720 the storyline isnt breaking any new ground and begins to unravel somewhat at the end but theres power here and the characters will definitely stay with you after the battle ends
8507721 long after we forget the details we remember the feelings certain games of our youth evoked
8507722 though its difficult to put into words tales of vesperia manages to recapture even if only for fleeting moments some of those elusive intangibles that led to lost rpg weekends on the super nintendo and playstation 1
8507723 fun fast paced combat a charming likable cast a colorful inviting world that begs exploration and quick seamless pacing thats always got you on the move and tackling something fresh
8507724 yuris simply more relevant and relatable than luke abyss whiny teen noble lead
8507725 weve all had those moments where the deck feels stacked against us and we fantasize about taking the law into our own hands and yuris the embodiment of that vigilante spirit
8507726 sure vesperia s filled with traditional tropes plucky princess sly trickster buxom warrior chick but most of them are inoffensive at worst and wholly charming at best
8507727 and yes many surprises are telegraphed right from the start but not all of them yuris tale of vengeance includes some surprisingly mature themes and twists and i actually felt some empathy for the final foe during the requisite last battle speech
8507728 the english script feels somewhat rushed and its clear that some lines of text were translated without any context at all leading to quite a few awkward stilted exchanges
8507729 vesperia succeeds as well as any japanese rpg this generation
8507730 son as far as i am concerned nothing in this life now gives me any pleasure i do not know why i am still here since i have no further hopes in this world i did have one reason for wanting to live a little longer to see you become a catholic christian before i died god has lavished his gifts on me in that respect for i know that you have renounced earthly happiness to be his servant so what am i doing here

8507738 world of warcraft is designed as a pc game its designed to have a keyboard and a mouse so the controls and the control scheme that you have are very pc centric if you think about mapping those controls and all those different type of buttons that you have to a console without a keyboard for chatting its a very challenging proposition
8507739 i mean we love console games also and im sure there will be a successful mmo sometime on a console so it has nothing to do with that its just more like a square peg round hole thing for our game it just wasnt designed with that in mind

8507858 hi im flying out to chicago tomorrow morning can i please buy some mamon and ensaymada i am going to buy a lot
8507859 id spent 10 years in italy and i learnt a lot there
8507860 im happy that i started my career in that country but it was just getting a little bit stale there
8507861 italy is still an important country to play in but the english premier league had something special that i wanted to be involved in
8507862 id made up my mind to leave italy obviously it wasnt that simple but blackburn made an important offer and im happy to be here
8507863 theres a certain enthusiasm about all the stadiums of england the way that the people enjoy their football
8507864 i think the clubs have invested a lot of money in bringing in the top players and they have improved the football as a consequence
8507865 it is an enthusiastic league to watch the opportunity was there and i thought it would be good to measure myself against such a good league
8507866 thats what ive told adelaide director of football michael petrillo
8507867 hes a fantastic professional fantastic footballer and is extremely good within the group and a good natured person so for me hes got to stay i spoke to him even today
8507868 i also understand hes a footballer who wants to do the best for himself and his family
8507869 weve been in that situation before so any decision he makes is solely for himself and i understand that but in my opinion cassios a player here for the long term
8507870 agos fine he probably was ready last week but we were a bit precautionary with him
8507871 hes trained this whole week so hes ready to go
8507872 its not always wise to start someone in that situation when the games very intense
8507873 but to come off the bench hed be pretty good the two strikers were probably the two outstanding players last week
8507874 its important we find out exactly where were at at this stage of the season
8507875 theyve changed their formation virtually every game ive seen them play in the pre season and the first two rounds
8507876 i would say garys either trying to change a couple of things so all we can do is focus on what we do well
8507877 weve gone six games undefeated its our first home game so we have to play to our strengths
8507878 i look forward to returning to seattle after my surgery to cheer on the storm
8507879 im disappointed that i wont be able to finish out the regular season but i have confidence in my teammates im hopeful that i can rejoin them for the wnba finals
8507880 weve been playing the last six plus weeks without lauren in practice and in games
8507881 i think shes a very confident person she wants to help our team you know shes going to do everything she can to make it happen whether it can happen thats debatable
8507882 its been two years since i played for this team and i cant believe im here after two weeks of watching the absolute best basketball in the world im excited to play
8507883 were back to playing the footy that we like to play and that is intimidating teams putting the pressure on and making the most of the turnovers
8507884 were just playing as a team and not relying on too many individuals
8507885 we can finish top four but freo have got a lot of blokes that are retiring so theyre going to be out to beat us as well
8507886 ive been in that position before where collingwood was down the bottom of the ladder and youre playing just to knock a team off and wreck their finals chances so theyll be fired up so its a matter of us taking them on early
8507887 hes obviously just walking at this stage but hell have a long break
8507888 flyings not the best thing for it so hell just freshen up over the weekend and get it right so hopefully run next week and play next weekend
8507889 this a place i have been visting for the better part of 20 years or so
8507890 ill give you everything i own if you could finish your plate
8507891 given that im the biggest pig alive i was surprised that i had eaten forevers and i still had leftovers and im the queen of eating

8507909 i always knew this is what i was going to do
8507910 i never thought id do anything else after my playing career was over
8507911 i knew in my senior year in high school that coaching football is what i wanted to do
8507912 does that change as you go down the way certainly other opportunities come up fortunately this job came up and it was the perfect fit
8507913 after my dad got done playing football he went straight to coaching and he looked like he enjoyed it
8507914 i wanted to enjoy the work that i did and football is something that i really love working with kids is really good and it just seemed natural because everybody in my family is a teacher
8507915 but after two weeks go by and im saying things over and over im just coach aldridge
8507916 this is a first for a lot of us god has given us good direction on how to lead and placed some good coaches and mentors around me were trying to change the approach and mindset of westbury christian football
8507917 the satisfaction for me is being able to teach the game of football to young men

8508012 the emergence of russia china and india as great powers the spread of lethal weapons
8508013 and the resurgence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front against terrorism

8508038 its also scoping out the job its basically putting a design together
8508039 there have been re enactments at other locations where weve marched four miles with all the food on our backs and then camped out we want to show people that the equipment they had worked very well
8508040 to do it on an actual historic site an underground railroad site it really makes the whole fight come alive
8508041 we do this to honor the men that fought in that war and every other war so that people dont forget what they did for our country
8508042 the whole purpose of the event is to draw people from all nationalities of asian background
8508043 also to bring in non asians to showcase the culture and the arts
8508044 chinese is different from japanese thai is different from laos
8508045 children will dress up in chinese outfits we have two koreans and there will be some cambodian and many laotian outfits

8508056 i think this is an excellent opportunity for anybody who wants to meet or learn more about asian culture
8508057 most of the people you will meet there will be very easy to communicate with because they are second and third generation asian americans
8508058 this is one time you can actually take in the asian culture without even leaving elgin

8508159 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care

8508164 obamas target is an ad by the conservative american issues project a nonprofit group that questions obamas ties to ayers a founder of the weather underground organization that took credit for a series of bombings including nonfatal explosions at the pentagon and u s capitol four decades ago

8508211 one of my earliest memories was being in that hospital dad always at our side
8508212 we not the senate were all he cared about he decided not to take the oath of office he said delaware can get another senator but my boys cant get another father however great men like ted kennedy mike mansfield hubert humphrey men who had been tested themselves convinced him to serve
8508213 barack obama and i took very different journeys to this destination but we share a common story
8508214 mine began in scranton pa and then wilmington del with a dad who fell on hard economic times but who always told me champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8508215 my mothers creed is americas creed no one is better than you you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8508216 almost every night i take the train home to wilmington sometimes very late
8508217 as i look out the window at the homes we pass i can almost hear what theyre talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed
8508218 thats the america that george bush has left us and thats the future george excuse me john mccain will give us freudian slip freudian slip
8508219 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8508220 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8508221 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8508222 now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8508223 i love this but we have important work to do tonight
8508224 i am honored to be here tonight to support barack obama
8508225 and to warm up the crowd for joe biden though as youll soon see he doesnt need any help from me i love joe biden and america will too
8508226 all star line up and came down to two remarkable americans locked in a hard fought contest to the very end
8508227 but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children and im grateful for the chance chelsea and i had to tell americans about the person we know and love
8508228 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8508229 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8508230 yes he can but first you need to vote for him
8508231 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8508232 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8508233 i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the further conduct of the roll call vote that all votes cast by the delegates will be counted and that i move that sen barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8508234 you know i am sorry if anyone was offended it was certainly not meant in any way to be offensive
8508235 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked him obama personally
8508236 you could say that no ones ever really prepared to be president
8508237 but if he knew how to make it bad then he knows how to make it right again
8508238 weve always been very impressed with him and i just wish he would continue to be an elder statesman like a younger jimmy carter
8508239 as part of that tradition i am here today to release you as my delegates
8508240 many other people who sign their ballots will make a different choice
8508241 you are to be given the respect and recognition you have earned as delegates for the democratic party
8508242 i remember going through each and every one of those primaries thinking this one is going to push her over no its not this one is going to push her over no its not and so i think it was a continual process of being excited and anxious and let down excited anxious and letdown
8508243 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world
8508244 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8508245 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that sen mccain once denounced as immoral candidate mccain criticizes sen mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that sen mccain wrote are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8508246 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8508247 we cannot afford four more years like the past eight years policies that embolden our enemies undermine our economy and place an unfair burden on the heroes of our armed forces john mccain asks that we trust republicans to safeguard our national security to which we can only reply why would we
8508248 we need a president who is not wedded to 20th century thinking who can forge a network of power and principle that will keep america strong and safe in the 21st century
8508249 voters are more likely to say obama cares a lot about their personal needs and problems 37 percent to 23 percent for mccain
8508250 voters think obama may be more like them a man they could relate to 55 percent to 41 percent
8508251 majorities 63 percent for each candidate agree that both obama and mccain share the values most americans try to live by
8508252 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states

8508263 dies erachte ich als ausserordentlich wichtiges element auch wenn ich mir keine illusionen mache
8508264 dennoch ist es aus meiner sicht unumstritten dass falsch angelegte anreizsysteme ein zentraler teil der dynamik waren deren dramatische konsequenzen wir nun erleben demzufolge besteht hier offensichtlicher handlungsbedarf
8508265 dies ist auf jeden fall zu begr ssen ich warte gespannt darauf erste konkrete resultate zu sehen

8508392 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
8508393 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
8508394 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare

8508398 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
8508399 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
8508400 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing
8508401 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid
8508402 a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise
8508403 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
8508404 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
8508405 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
8508406 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
8508407 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly
8508408 i am diogenes the dog i nuzzle the kind bark at the greedy and bite scoundrels

8508452 there will be a change or two from the team that played last week but having said that only one or two because thats all weve got
8508453 we may well this week only have two emergencies thats where its at its difficult
8508454 through 17 players being out what weve found is guys have been given opportunities to play in different positions and guys are getting better looks in different positions
8508455 with that has come some confidence and a different angle to the team and in turn we are getting a different outlook on that particular player too
8508456 its given a lot of young players opportunities where it wouldnt have done in the past i think if anything its going to benefit the club going forward
8508457 we havent got a lot to play for we havent for a number of weeks but weve still been managing to play quite good football
8508458 under no circumstances during this year have we lost the spring in our step theyve been resilient
8508459 its six months before you get to play again so its all of those reasons why we will give it our all in the final game
8508460 catholic groups demonstrated outside canada house in london on tuesday in protest against the deportation of us soldiers who refused to fight in iraq and sought asylum in canada
8508461 canada stop deporting us soldiers who refuse to fight in the illegal war in iraq
8508462 in the year that franz jagerstater was beatified by the pope in recognition of his conscientious objection and subsequent execution for refusing to serve in hitlers army it seems extraordinary that the canadian government is adopting this position these soldiers have every right to refuse to fight in an illegal war
8508463 now for a few updates on the home front army deserter robin long a boise native was sentenced to 15 months in jail after being kicked out of canada and returned to his unit at fort carson colo he will also get a dishonorable discharge

8508466 to do more in afghanistan our marines have got to see relief elsewhere
8508467 conway also declared that al anbar province would be turned over to iraqis iraqis under the control of the puppet government controlled by the us
8508468 there are discussions going on between the united states and iraqi government were working to try to finalize an agreement by the end of december i dont have anything new to offer other than what weve said and that we think this is an important agreement and once we have an agreement we will certainly make that known to the publics

8508473 the analysis by the times found that obama donors gave 300 000 to mrs clinton in july and 135 000 in june
8508474 the democrats nominated a junior inexperienced senator with no legislative accomplishments on his resume to whom young americans and latte liberals swarmed due to his cool celebrity like demeanor but then those same democratic leaders act surprised that middle america isnt following suit how bizarre
8508475 the meltdown of progressive blogosphere 1 0 is due in large part to major a list bloggers turning a blind eye to misogyny and sexism because it helped the candidate they supported massive fail
8508476 apart from their assertion which is false that obama will end the occupation of iraq the authors make no attempt to substantiate their claim that obama represents a stark ideological contrast with mccain in fact they virtually acknowledge just the opposite
8508477 the party is worried now about mass defections by clinton supporters to john mccain well what in the hell did they expect after the may 31 charade effectively handing obama the nomination they lost what little chance they had in the fall dont expect clinton supporters to get over it any more than gore supporters when the 2000 election was stolen
8508478 street food almost always has this super well cooked fatty element in it that is completely balanced by straight bright acid

8508480 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far what do you think
8508481 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8508482 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8508483 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8508484 reminded us of what its like when you actually put people first
8508485 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8508495 whatever evidence we have got is consistent with the maoist stamp in the kind of operation they undertake the assailants had left a note written on the letterhead of vamsadhara zonal committee signed by one azad and it is consistent with the maoist methods
8508496 we have interrogated people but had to let them go after finding little evidence
8508497 as organisations expand their own offerings and move into new emerging territories they expect the same services and standards that they have become accustomed to in their established bases this includes how they manage their fleets and as such we see immense potential within these particular regions in the established central european regions a growing number of companies are turning to bynx to develop solutions to meet their specific individual requirements hence the appointment of the new distributors

8508511 damiens butterfly series predates his formaldehyde series he held an exhibition in woodstock gallery in london in 1991 where he had put up monochrome canvases on the walls and let loose live butterflies to fly around the hall to match the colours on his canvas
8508512 many of the butterflies died in course of the exhibition and that is what damien wanted he wanted to capture the beautiful but the short life cycle of butterflies
8508513 in 1992 he held an exhibition where animals and butterflies were preserved in formaldehyde
8508514 in 1988 hirst made his spot painting a series of circular coloured dots on a canvas and followed it up with more in 1990 they were part of his pharmaceutical art series through which he tried to drive home the message that people must have more faith in medicines which like art can heal

8508523 although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximise their beneficial role

8508570 these guns have been linked to 52 shootings including nine murders eight of which occurred in london they are extremely dangerous and i would urge anyone who thinks they may have seen one or knows someone who is hiding one to tell us and stop more people being hurt
8508571 we can see very clearly the devastating impact of this heinous crime particularly and disproportionately although not exclusively on black communities
8508572 the availability of these weapons is clearly fuelling violence on our streets they have caused devastating shootings murders and mayhem we all have a responsibility to keep our community safe and report information about them so i appeal to anyone who may have information on their location to give that information to police or anonymously to crimestoppers

8508575 we provide an excellent level of professional care but that level of care stops at a point in time when we reach the hospital
8508576 the level of care that these patients require is certainly something that only a doctor can deliver and asking paramedics to maintain the patient at that same level it certainly puts the patients lives and conditions at risk

8508957 our decision to engage was made in the last second as the russian tanks were rolling we had no choice

8508959 i got a call from the minister of defense who by the way in case i havent mentioned it before is 29 years old that russian tanks some 200 were massing to enter tskhinvali capital of the russian protectorate of south ossetia from north ossetia

8508992 there appears to be a shift taking place in the pc industry the move from 32 bit to 64 bit pcs weve been tracking the change by looking at the percentage of 64 bit pcs connecting to windows update and have seen a dramatic increase in recent months the installed base of 64 bit windows vista pcs as a percentage of all windows vista systems has more than tripled in the u s in the last three months while worldwide adoption has more than doubled during the same period another view shows that 20 of new windows vista pcs in the u s connecting to windows update in june were 64 bit pcs up from just 3 in march put more simply usage of 64 bit windows vista is growing much more rapidly than 32 bit based on current trends this growth will accelerate as the retail channel shifts to supplying a rapidly increasing assortment of 64 bit desktops and laptops

8509009 he had sarcoidosis but it was in remission but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from

8509019 russia had never expressed any interest in ossetian or abkhazian micronationalisms while georgia was an integral part of the soviet union
8509020 kosovo which was legally part of yugoslavia but not of serbia was never manipulated as part of the partition or intervention plan of another country
8509021 which was legally part of yugoslavia but not of serbia
8509022 kosovo would have to be not to its breaking away but to its potential absorption and annexation by albania and nobody has even proposed this let alone countenanced the unilateral stationing of albanian armed forces on kosovar soil
8509023 the whole emphasis of western policy in the balkans has been on de emphasizing ethnic divisions subsidizing cities and communities that practice reconciliation and encouraging for example serbs and albanians to cooperate in kosovo

8509035 without discounting the seriousness of the charges against jesse ray beard the fact that he now appears to want to take advantage of a means of getting the best education possible is heartening
8509036 the fact that the only way he was given this choice was through a tragic series of events points to inherent problems in our nations educational system that must be rectified
8509037 they say that every dark cloud has a silver lining in this case jesse ray beard is laying the groundwork to give himself a second chance through a quality education at a reputable school this is unfortunately not a choice available to his classmates in jena
8509038 while beard may still be punished for what he allegedly did back in louisiana he is now taking advantage of something that could open up collegiate and career opportunities that were little more than a dream at jena high its a crime that parents and students everywhere dont have a similar ability to go to a school that provides ample opportunity

8509071 about obama on national security patriotism and keeping america strong these are strong defense democrats who give obama remarkably low marks on national security and have great trouble dismissing what reverend jeremiah wright said about america
8509072 racial but not necessarily racist these voters want to know that obama will be a president for the whole country and not mainly represent african americans and for many this is a threshold issue only 19 percent think he is similar to jesse jackson however these voters do not understand how obama could sit in reverend wrights pews for 20 years
8509073 barack obamas support among young people is stable and convincing currently 57 29 percent obama this stability rests in part on the strong belief among young people that barack obama can change things in this country
8509074 impressive majorities of young people defy the cynical stereotypes of this generation and predict major changes on the economy on iraq on health care on energy even gas prices young people do not believe john mccain can bring about change
8509075 for each 10 percent increase in african american turnout obama gains approximately 13 electoral votes and 1 percent in his popular vote margin against john mccain even a 10 percent increase is enough to take him from a slight underdog against mccain to a slight favorite while at higher levels of turnout improvement obama becomes the strong favorite

8509285 i have always said that the change we seek will not come easy that it will not come without its share of sacrifice and struggle
8509286 and the last thing we need is dead weight like nate walsh adding another 20 or 30 years to the process
8509287 when i began this campaign my mission was to help this nation share my vision for one america not a black america or a white america or a latino or asian america
8509288 but now what i see what i envision is a nate free america and once we get rid of that guy there is nothing we cant accomplish nothing we cant achieve
8509289 i am reminded of an instance early last year when nate told his sister elizabeth that he was going to start going to the gym three times a week after work
8509290 i was rooting for nate i thought that this time things would be different that this time nate would be capable of change but it was just like 1997 1999 2000 and 2002 all over again he went to the gym twice and quit
8509291 people of america not nate we have the ability to heal this nation
8509292 yes we can nate excluded seize our future yes we can with the exception of nate and his stupid cargo shorts that he never washes turn the page to a new tomorrow i am confident that where we and by we i mean everyone but nate are met with cynicism and doubt and fear and those who tell us that we cant we again not nate will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of the american people in six simple words yes we can except nate walsh

8509316 i asked if it was pants they didnt like and would lloyds is rubbish do but they didnt think so
8509317 so i tried barclays is better and that didnt go down too well either

8509323 hes really in a perfect position for us for a number of reasons
8509324 every play ive got to stop one guy from either getting to the quarterback or getting to the ball carrier thats kind of how i look at things
8509325 so i like to come in to work every day choose a couple of things that im going to get better at and just kind of work on my trade
8509326 the big picture spots on the team what coaches think of me theyre essentially out of my control and a very wise person told me that theres no way to make yourself go crazy faster than to worry about things that are out of your control

8509328 ive been really happy with how i feel and really happy with how my knee bounced back
8509329 its an incredible show of faith by nbc and so amazingly nice to get based on the work alone
8509330 weve had a great partnership with nbc since day one on chuck

8509336 mark is a more mobile guy that creates opportunities for himself to make some plays in addition to the normal plays in the offense
8509337 hes very competitive hes a great practice player hes got a great arm hes really a fantastic player i think hes going to do everything that anybody can do with this spot if he can hold on to his job and keep ahead of mitch mustain and aaron corp because the competition is on as it always is
8509338 we had a terrific run in our history here but the kids who have been in the program for so many years winning championships have all left us
8509339 this season has brought emergence of the leadership from guys like brian cushing rey maualuga and kevin ellison and mark sanchez and kristopher odowd we sense a whole new excitement about a program
8509340 the quarterback position is i wont say of concern but ill say of interest
8509341 were going to have five guys competing for that job we have a practice order and nate costa heads that up but justin roper did a tremendous job in our bowl game and probably his performance in practices leading up to that game and in the oregon state game gave our team the confidence i believe to win that football game
8509342 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far what do you think
8509343 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8509344 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8509345 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8509346 reminded us of what its like when you actually put people first
8509347 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8509348 dallas is so gifted in so many other areas aside from music that i felt he didnt have the time nor the energy to really put into me like i felt i should be so i parted ways
8509349 were still in the works but trying to get in with nitti and trying to get a record from jd jermaine dupri this time i havent worked with jermaine since 2001
8509350 i definitely wanted to venture out to entrepreneurship and not just be one dimensional as an artist but one day owning my own company and one day writing music for other artists as well having empire is kind of that home that source and that foundation for me to produce that
8509351 we dont speak on the regular but like i said its no bad blood if i do see him im definitely going to speak and be respectful and i believe its vice versa as well

8509353 of course i suggest an alternate approach i encourage individuals and this of course assumes they dont have some timeline like a bodybuilding contest to get into shape to plan their cheating that is consider these two individuals 1 the first individual follows a super strict diet 6 days out of the week but one day out of the week when willpower gives out they have that first piece of pizza suddenly the wave of guilt hits and the rest of the pizza disappears to atone for their sin this person hits it that much harder the next week more restriction more time on the bike leading to yet another and probably bigger binge the next weekend this cycle repeats until this person finally just gives up completely 2 the second person is following the same strict diet but has decided that one meal per week they get to eat whatever they want pizza donuts whatever just eat it be happy and get on with their life no guilt no increased resolve to do better the next week because this was a planned excursion from the diet the end result is the same 6 days of dieting with an excursion to eat whatever you want but the psychological effect is totally different the first person feels nothing but guilt for their excursion from the diet because it wasnt part of the plan the second can easily go back to their diet the next day since the excursion was part of the overall plan who do you think is more likely to stick with their plan the one who feels guilty every weekend or the one who feels in control of what they are trying to achieve ok enough pop psychology what are the physiological effects of bingeing while on a fat loss diet in the short term at least the body is able to deal with an excessive influx of calories by raising metabolic rate think about thanksgiving day the average person consumes from 4000 7000 calories on that one day from a strictly thermodynamic standpoint that should equal a true fat gain not including water and stuff of 1 2 lbs but it never does sure we all gain a few pounds but its mainly water and carbs being stored as glycogen which is quickly lost its only when caloric intake is higher than caloric expenditure in the long term that true fat gain occurs

8509368 these upbeat capital goods numbers amid a downtrodden u s consumer sector indicates how helpful a weak dollar is in the current cycle
8509369 the recent downturn in growth abroad and stabilization of the dollar could put pressure on capital goods spending in the months ahead
8509370 exports are holding up a lot better than we thought they would with the weakness in europe and japan and we are seeing the impact of the stimulus package on business investment decisions

8509373 i cant run 100 percent my swing is fine im not having any problems with my swing its just running you just have to be controlled which stinks but i think im running well enough to play
8509374 it felt good i definitely put a lot more effort in it
8509375 you dont have too much time to think about anything in camp he said
8509376 its a very long camp a very strenuous camp they make practices harder than games i can truthfully say that
8509377 weve been busting our butt to get out here and do some good things and i think we have i think weve gotten a lot more experience on the offensive side of the ball
8509378 it feels a lot like last year he said recalling a season when the tigers went in unranked and ended up at no
8509379 we have expectations internally that no one knows and i think all that really matters to us 80 guys playing football or the strength staff or the coaching staff is what we all think we know what were capable of and we just need to go out there and do it
8509380 you look at all the questions that need to be answered its all about camaraderie and how this team is going to gel in the heat of battle i dont think you can really answer any of these questions until you go out on the field
8509381 this year compared to last year media people like to say we have more of a question mark on the offensive line but if you look at the guys coming in its just how youre going to gel and how youre going to handle adversity when it strikes
8509382 theres more national exposure theres more media exposure and i think that were mature enough to do that now
8509383 two three years in the past i wouldnt say we were
8509384 our defense from this camp to last camp is totally different in every aspect it could possibly be ive missed more coverages in two a days than i had ever just because theyre disguising so much more and they have so many more blitz packages they know what theyre doing theyre flying all over the place
8509385 last year and two years ago we thought we had to score every single time we had the football daniel said
8509386 it makes us not have a lot of pressure to go out and score 40 points a game we can win games 21 14 if need be
8509387 hed be a great coach mizzou coach gary pinkel said
8509388 he could run a company too hes a very smart guy theres no question about it hes a leader hes got a great football mind thats probably an understatement and hes very smart hes so smart hes probably smart enough not to be a coach
8509389 second and second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden
8509390 that primary campaign produced so much heat it increased global warming
8509391 our nation is in trouble on two fronts the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weekend
8509392 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8509393 barack obam is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8509394 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8509395 as president he will work for an america more partners and fewer adversaries
8509396 president obama will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort
8509397 most important of all barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are first strong at home
8509398 people have been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8509399 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8509400 yes he can but first we have to elect him the choice is clear the republicans will nominate a good man how has served our country heroically and who has suffered terribly in a vietnamese prison camp he loves his country every bit as much as we do as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy but on the 2 great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy that has defined his partys for 25 years its a philosophy that wasnt fully seen in action until 2001 then we saw what would happen to america if the policies were implemented
8509401 now in spite of all this evidence their candidate is promising more of the same
8509402 they actually want to reward them for the last 8 years by giving them 4 more thanks but no thanks in this case the third case is not the charm
8509403 senator obamas life is a 21st century incarnation of the old fashioned american dream his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the more perfect union of our founders dreams the values of freedom and equal opportunity which have given him his historic chance will drive him as president to give all america their chance to build a decent life and show our humanity as well as our strengths to the world we see our humanity our strengths and our nations future in barack and michelle obama and their beautiful children and biden and his family barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last 8 years back to unity and hope so if like me you believe that america must always be a place called hope then join hillary and chelsea and me in making barack obama the next president of the united states thank you and god bless you
8509404 stanley called me and told me the rams had drafted two receivers
8509405 i play football so all i can worry about is being the best receiver that i can be and whatever happens happens obviously they saw a reason to draft two receivers and theyre pretty good so that makes the team better competition is always a good thing
8509406 its going to be our hardest decision on those guys at the end of the roster were going to have to ultimately cut some good players that were really high on thats a good problem to have but its also tough
8509407 youve just got to get in and when you get the ball make plays as much as possible you cant worry about things you cant control
8509408 youre looking for any opportunity you get and taking advantage of it everybodys chasing that quinton culberson type dream theres guys that have done it and theyve done it because theyve come out when the lights went on and have made plays thats kind of what were looking for
8509409 the market was turning weaker towards the close after the release of the gdp gross domestic product data
8509410 last year was a great win for our race team
8509411 skagit speedway owner steve beitler has done a great job of making this a much bigger event he increased the payout to 25 000 for the winner and getting that was a great win for us last year
8509412 every time you hit the track you go out to win
8509413 it doesnt matter how much the payout is you just want to win last year it was a lot of fun racing joey saldana for the win the track was in good condition and we took advantage
8509414 its been a pretty good year for us so far
8509415 obviously wed like it to be even better but we won some speedweek titles we were third at the knoxville nationals and second at dirtcar nationals this has been pretty much a whole new team for me and ive gotten a lot of help from my crew and my wife and it has paid off for us
8509416 we put together a car similar to the one we used last year for the win weve been flagged with some motor issues this year but we think weve got that corralled were ready to roll
8509417 the racing is really good there is a lot of action and some good hard racing the track is laid out really well and it is a lot of fun to drive there im excited to get back
8509418 i had one of my aunties and uncles calling me saying like congratulations
8509419 i was kind of down wondering am i really going to be able to make it this year on the team or am i going to have to wait until january to get back in but i had fans and teammates telling me its going to be ok keep your head up and all of a sudden it worked for me fine
8509420 weve given a fair opportunity to all and he has shown himself to be able to do some things just a little bit different than some of the other guys
8509421 when i was running with the ones brandon was hurt so i thought when he came back hed be with the ones
8509422 id have no problem being his reserve of whatever hes a heck of an athlete and he has game experience that a freshman doesnt have it was real surprising
8509423 the thing ive said that what ive seen from chris is kind of that wow factor that you stand there as a coach and watch some of the plays he makes as a coach and you stand there and go wow
8509424 its a wonderful sensation to have as a coach when you have a player who does that so its exciting
8509425 thank you karl for taking a rest day so i could finally guess right thanks
8509426 in preseason they have to get ready and they have to go but you kind of hold your breath the entire time last week there were some very good players who were hurt around the league and you just hold your breath and hope it doesnt happen to your team
8509427 he is a young man and he has a back like mine
8509428 at the scouting combine they do a pretty thorough physical and we do interviews there wasnt any indication there was a problem there we found out about it and tried to treat it and it was the doctors opinion it wouldnt get better
8509429 the baby sitting thing is over he said it crushed him to miss all of training camp and then he reminded me that he practiced as much as center chris spencer hes a funny guy
8509430 he is a big strong guy but he is a little bit behind
8509431 my command has been down but i still feel good
8509432 my arm feels good im just not getting it done right now
8509433 you just gotta keep going out there and know you can pitch
8509434 its one of those situations where you go through some rough times and bad breaks
8509435 anything that could go wrong for sean is going wrong
8509436 i was pretty sharp in the first half but i just havent been as sharp as of late
8509437 you can get hurt pretty quick and thats what happened the last few times ive pitched
8509438 kubel has not hit lefties at all this year but he starts against us when we throw a lefty because he hits us so well
8509439 i didnt see the point the eighth inning should belong to sean green and thats the way we went
8509440 our lefties have just not been getting left handers out its a simple as that
8509441 thats the only thing you can do is send him there
8509442 it was a good decision by sammy youre just hoping the throw is a hair off line
8509443 it was a good pitch but i think he was looking change in that situation i was surprised how far it carried
8509444 those plans were later changed because of very serious reasons
8509445 i dont mean serious as in dire i mean serious as in good business practices
8509446 producers and directors would rather be in the city limits
8509447 its great for the industry we need soundstage space we need a space for all the work thats coming in
8509448 what weve always needed is a big empty soundproof box with high ceilings and now were going to get it
8509449 in an ideal world the production office is right next to the soundstage especially when a film is stage intensive
8509450 we should be getting really busy here pretty quickly were waiting on people to dot their is and cross their ts
8509451 it wouldnt have happened at all without the pennsylvania film tax credit program as an incentive
8509452 we will be hiring quite a few people thats one of the things im most proud of were going to be putting people to work
8509453 you are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy
8509454 sweetheart you need to get up or else youre going to be late for school
8509455 you need to get up if you want to get to school on time
8509456 why do you have to talk in such a mean voice
8509457 all she wants to do is play on the rings
8509458 she doesnt play with me anymore and i cant do the rings
8509459 because they are compartmentalized just to put things in order

8509478 the finance ministry is introducing yet another anomaly by lowering the extant of parities of officers of the armed forces of the lt col and equivalent by retaining them in pay band 3 while raising similarly placed civilian and paramilitary officers to pay band 4
8509479 it is reliably learnt that civilian and paramilitary officers in the extant pay scales s 24 rs 14 300 400 18 300 and s 25 rs 15 100 400 18 300 will be placed in pay band 4 whereas the same is being denied to the armed forces officers lt col and equivalent who were already in s 25
8509480 this is not just affecting a lt col because of this the pay of coast guards commandant with 23 years of experience will be equivalent to a rear admiral with 30 years of experience
8509481 a troop increase is likely to inflame afghan nationalism because afghans are more anti foreign than we acknowledge and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining the more responsibility we take in afghanistan the more we undermine the credibility and responsibility of the afghan government and encourage it to act irresponsibly
8509482 unless the next american president builds on the existing commitments to help lift the afghan people out of extreme poverty and protect civilians it will be impossible for the country to achieve lasting peace

8509494 i cant imagine that feeling of playing in front of my hometown it would be amazing if i can get it done
8509495 for me the markets are showing signs of being war weary

8509524 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8509525 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8509526 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8509527 barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8509528 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up

8509531 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8509532 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8509533 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8509534 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8509535 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8509536 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8509537 i thought it was complete already whats taking so long
8509538 weve always felt this was a county issue unfortunately because these folks are outside our jurisdiction we were limited in our options
8509539 it didnt appear that he had any business at that location and he was parked in a far off corner

8509544 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8509545 i think its a kind of personal touch its nice maybe every phone that gets a full quality test should have its testers picture taken and left on there and the working conditions look pretty good
8509546 i openly no flamingly endorse obama whether he says hes for gay marriage or not i know under obama it will only be a matter of time until the country sees the legalization of gay marriage
8509547 i support abortion on demand universal healthcare raising taxes gutting our economy etc
8509548 he was so much bigger on the inside than the outside that it was like magic he had rooms inside him that i bet even he had never entered there were parts of him he kept locked closed too just so his life wouldnt be too big to handle so big he could get lost inside himself wander for days for years looking for the door leading back out to this small real world
8509549 all im saying is that if i ever start referring to these as the best years of my life remind me to kill myself

8509555 on the macrumors forum the flaw lets anyone sidestep passcode locking by simply tapping
8509556 the passcode lock feature is designed to prevent applications from being launched unless the correct passcode is entered
8509557 an implementation issue in the handling of emergency calls allows users with physical access to an iphone to launch an application without the passcode this update addresses the issue through an improved check on the state of the passcode lock

8509565 what we came up with is a way to save and salvage the private property rights of the cobbs as well as pleasing the community by saving the property and preserving its heritage
8509566 this does not mean that some individual cant come in and just purchase the property to restore it themselves
8509567 it doesnt alleviate any other option of someone doing it but were trying to be proactive to come up with some good options because we have not seen anyone else come up with anything
8509568 the main factors that could determine the actual inflation rate for the month are the impact of the onset of the typhoon season and rising costs of raw materials for production of certain food items which could be balanced off by lower international rice and oil prices
8509569 we will remain watchful of developments to make sure that our policy stance is consistent with our price stability mandate
8509570 the kane county health department will be conducting an on site inspection of the walter paytons roundhouse after several complaints about flies within the meals
8509571 please stay away until the kane county health department issues their official findings
8509572 i clearly meant it solely as a fyi to my colleagues
8509573 apparently the health department takes these complaints very seriously but it was not my intention to be mean spirited or shut down the roundhouse i just wanted peace of mind
8509574 the roundhouse had a bad day with flies and i had a bad day in judgment
8509575 but the measure of a man is how you bounce back and i will bounce back with professionalism and work to improve the overall business climate of aurora anyone who gives me a chance will see this was an isolated incident and is not a pattern or a trend of manny maysonet
8509576 suspended for five days without pay for his actions which she referred to as a misuse of city computers and e mail
8509577 we do not comment on personnel issues disciplinary measures or union negotiations
8509578 his actions in recent days show he is not qualified and he has no credibility
8509579 i have an unwavering commitment to best serve citizens of aurora and improve our business climate
8509580 i will continue to bring new initiatives and best economic development practices to the city of aurora
8509581 we are also studying the possibility of widening the coverage of the writ of amparo by providing protection to economic social and cultural rights including protection against demolitions and bringing the judiciary closer to the poor

8509590 pale indeed do you know how hard it is to maintain this unearthly shadow
8509591 ew would you look at the mess theyre making honestly
8509592 i dont know why you keep them on the counter for anyone to see
8509593 i like to watch them dont you like watching your lobster before you send it to the boil
8509594 see now that is how you use that phrase and i thought you hated all those happy things
8509595 thats when theyre free to meddle around in my perfectly dismal day taking it upon themselves to brighten my perspective
8509596 they must be if you eat them arent they then
8509597 whatever it is youve been using as the main ingredient keeps escaping and im tired of cleaning up the bloody trail what if we have guests unexpectedly that mrs murphy of the neighbourhood watch has been on my case because of the lawn recently and i just know shell show up one of these days after that whatever it is has sloshed itself across the foyer and then what a mess

8509607 the court will give the highest attention on this case more than in any other
8509608 thats why its important to hear the arguments of the government tomorrow friday
8509609 for many years we have been bringing legendary sports celebrities and top notch sports collectibles to thousands of fans in the los angeles market
8509610 all fans young and old should find plenty to browse and buy
8509611 you may have noticed that all of the nicer looking cups were taken up first leaving behind the plainer and cheaper ones while it is only natural for you to want only the best for yourselves that is actually the source of much of your stress related problems
8509612 some of the things we needed as a group we werent getting due to his discrepancies with the label if we needed more money in our budget for stuff it had to go through him to get approved with all that going on we had our own internal issues amongst me and the other ladies of the group unfortunately one of the members had quit it was a very hard time for us at that moment because we were trying to place a second record and we had just done the lady of soul awards but def jam was standing still they didnt know what to do with the situation so when we werent able to pull it together and sisqo didnt have any answers they decided to drop the group
8509613 my dream and my aspirations to sing doesnt stop at just one situation one deal or one group

8509620 what is more unique about this is that they are actually building it into the curriculum
8509621 were trying to use the city and the metropolitan region as a way of developing real life encounters that will enhance whatever is being taught in class people learn best when they are experiencing something
8509622 its a step in the right direction it just needs more clarification
8509623 if being in philadelphia is part of the appeal of a temple education then rounding out the core curriculum in the opportunities and challenges in philadelphia is a superb learning context
8509624 that only helps us in terms of revitalizing and bringing fresh blood in
8509625 the course is structured so that we lecture on underlying principles related to matter and energy and we try to make it more comprehensible through field trips
8509626 its really great to see local examples of these concepts
8509627 for the most part faculty have made their peace with that and are supportive of the program
8509628 la evidencia que estamos presentando es una prueba directa y admisible y sirve de respaldo a los cargos de narcotr fico y conspiraci n
8509629 posteriormente ella admiti que hab a mentido a las autoridades federales
8509630 ese incidente ocurri en el marco de un momento muy conspirativo y del que han resultado tres cargos con suficientes evidencias contra la acusada

8509632 we have heard from some community residents and some elected officials that they question whether the site they selected is a sound choice
8509633 were partners with the school district and obviously they have concerns as do camelot and the residents and political leaders of rhawnhurst we are in a holding pattern as is everyone else until we can come to some kind of decision
8509634 all sides have valid points i understand the communitys concerns they live there that is their community but 500 kids deserve a right to go to a decent well run school no matter what happened to them before we want to see that happen

8509636 we thought it was so interesting to combine two opposite worlds
8509637 i admire and worship her and its the kind of thing that i think is so wonderful to do at vuitton where its such an iconic brand and that monogram and everything and again ive said all this before but its so wonderful to have someone so outside of that thing take their look at it their approach to it
8509638 due to our clever coordination i anticipate that the wall between us will disappear
8509639 funnily enough i have never actually bought anything at vuitton but i probably will buy a party bag next week
8509640 the best thing about such one off events is the chance to arrive at something new from the meeting together of two different spirits
8509641 i think the keeping up of the tradition of making bags from so long ago is wonderful
8509642 creatively where my part of the collaboration is is actually the sending back and forth of e mails and working like i did with richard prince or takashi or whether its just sort of the cheerleader for the idea im not egotistically drawn that way i dont need the ownership of anything to that extent
8509643 ive kind of warned everybody up there that i think theyve gotten a little too into this idea which i mean is great
8509644 im glad that everybody gets behind it but what they dont realize is that i do it at a pace that maintains the brands integrity and seems really right and i think that sometimes everybody loves a good idea so much that they kind of go too far and it kind of kills it
8509645 prudence would dictate that we leave the text as it is until our candidate catches up with us
8509646 i want to give him a platform he can run on
8509647 i dont want to stick my finger in his eye
8509648 i decided i might get a chance to vote for a woman in my lifetime but i probably wont get another chance to vote for someone like mr obama so i thought i better grab it
8509649 i wished it and i hoped it but i never thought id be able to see it
8509650 never in my wildest dreams would i have expected this
8509651 i think that many didnt want to get their hopes up too high and some refused to dare to dream that it could really happen
8509652 as time went on and people learned about barack obama we began to believe that the u s would truly elect a president based on substance and not on race
8509653 one of the things that came up in the vetting process
8509654 which was a negative for me was that i have an uncontrollable left eyebrow
8509655 your high school girlfriends middle name and then you give a name and they come back and tell you she says she was never your girlfriend

8509658 i look around the room and everybodys wearing coats but some people in the back of the room are shivering
8509659 my dream is that one day a man can be judged not by the color of his skin but by the content of your character
8509660 things that martin luther king said are coming to be true
8509661 it is yet another historical movement that would bring every civil rights movement that i have participated in come full circle
8509662 she left me at home to go on the march
8509663 weve got to draw a sharp contrast with the other side not with words but with deeds
8509664 knock down the silly rumors and negativity that comes from the other side
8509665 we go on the offense about that message of change that we need a better economy that four more years of spiraling deficits and job loss and increasing energy and food costs and more home foreclosures is not what we need
8509666 senator mccain is squandering his career in public service with these kinds of slimy operators
8509667 this shows a disrespect for the electorate a belief that they are dumb and can be manipulated
8509668 its aimed at the 18 24 year old market but well take anyone really
8509669 with the help of mk channel o and the internet sa music has exploded today getting airtime as a young upcoming artist is easy the tough part is finding the talent amongst the masses giving kids a platform where they can promote themselves without having to spend money is the best we can offer young bands
8509670 first step to fame for any band is to get their friends on board so that the friends can tell their friends and so on and the easiest place to do this is on the three giants of social networking myspace facebook and speakerbox this is where they advertise their gigs and new music there are also a few great online battle of the band competitions running speakerbox in partnership with red bull and just launched the radar project which will see four new talents perform at rocking the daisies on 3 october and one lucky band also wins a free ep recording and music video
8509671 you really hate daredevil look how mean you are to daredevil

8509677 the jail van fell into the river preliminary investigations show at least nine police personnel were killed

8509728 as a mixologist i have spent years working with bartenders and customers that want to make their own drinks at home with pre arranged fruit and herbal pairings that work masterfully for cocktail combinations
8509729 i grew up in the kitchen as a young boy and have spent years working on and perfecting the taste profiles among fruits and herbs below is a list of the top ten fruits and herbs as well as the 5 elements to creating a well balanced cocktail provided by merino
8509730 as the liquid chef i spend time in the kitchen tasting pieces of fruit and pieces of herbs and pair them together until i find the right taste profile
8509731 its a matter of training the palate to pick up various flavors and aromas that pair well together with not only the fruit and herb but also the floral notes in the liquor
8509732 there truly are limitless fresh fruit and herbal combinations but it is always important to remember that balance is key in every cocktail the 5 tips below help to incorporate my beliefs into each cocktail that is made a guest should have a memorable experience in which they not only get to enjoy a great drink and dish pairing but they also walk away with a new understanding of gastronomy and mixology
8509733 despite the significant weakening of real gdp growth in mid 2008 inflation in the euro area has remained stubbornly high and well above the level that would be consistent with the ecb s definition of price stability an inflation rate of below but close to 2 in july 2008 annual inflation reached 4 0 having steadily risen from 2 1 in september 2007 this is largely due to the direct and indirect effects of past sharp increases in energy and food prices globally there are some indications however that domestic inflationary pressures are intensifying as labour cost growth has been increasing in the recent quarters
8509734 looking forward given the current futures prices for oil and other commodities the annual inflation rate in the euro area is likely to remain significantly above the level consistent with price stability for a considerable period of time before declining only gradually in the course of 2009
8509735 inflation is still the no 1 worry for central bankers in the euro region

8509741 i was shocked to see that only 20 of survey respondents strongly agreed that they know who their best shoppers are
8509742 worse yet absolutely no poorly performing retailers self identified that they do if you dont know who your best shoppers are and develop targeted ways to engage them you wont stand a chance at keeping them

8509755 they havent played a game who knows what happens we might go out there on thursday night and it might be 3 0 it might also be 46 43 nobody knows
8509756 as soon as you lose a game thats going to be the reason
8509757 they are looking at an offense thats been retooled for a new quarterback and so on so its gonna make a real interesting start to a football game
8509758 i dont think anybody will be able to sit in the stands and say well anybody can call those plays thats the same thing theyve been doing
8509759 fans arent gonna be bored everything they see will be the first time theyve ever seen it both sides of the ball and on both sidelines
8509760 thinking gets you beat people jump offsides it makes people play slow and that type thing i think its getting to be much less of a problem and its getting to where its more reactionary which is what it needs to be for football things are clicking right now as long as we dont turn the ball over this year i think we have a chance to have a very good season
8509761 i think in jonathan dwyer they probably have a better player than theyve ever had at that position
8509762 i dont know if they ever could have recruited jonathan to play fullback in this offense but hes probably perfect i think youd have to go back to earl campbell at texas to where you had such a great athlete running in such a similar situation
8509763 we definitely do a lot more blocking than in the old offense
8509764 in the new offense were lined up almost on the line outside of the tackles
8509765 its a different view for me and its a different type running too we do a lot of outside running and catch a lot of passes too

8509808 the gold coast is a vitally important region for football
8509809 it is one of the fastest growing regions in the country with a population already over half a million and a strong level of participation and interest in the sport
8509810 we know that the people of the gold coast enjoy supporting local teams and i have no doubt skilled park will be one of the best home grounds in the country
8509811 having a local team will also help encourage talented young players from the region as it gives them a clear pathway into australias premier competition
8509812 ffa has worked with us tirelessly to finalise our bid and to get this club up and running we thank them for their diligence and attention throughout the process
8509813 as a club we want to contribute as much as we can to the long term enrichment and development of the game that begins with harnessing support and input from the gold coast community then producing a successful entertaining team for them to support and be proud of
8509814 this is a fantastic outcome and we couldnt be happier and it is only the beginning of what is an exciting new era for football on the gold coast
8509815 north queensland has met all the commercial criteria we set for them last month including local community and business support which has been terrific
8509816 like the gold coast north queensland people are very proud of their local teams
8509817 we know that there are many people in the city of townsville and beyond who are looking forward to the hyundai a league being part of the north queensland sporting landscape
8509818 north queensland has a fine record of producing outstanding home grown players and having a local hyundai a league team will be another impetus to encourage more talented young footballers
8509819 i would like to thank ben and all his people at ffa for their patience and hard work with us
8509820 its been a fast and furious four weeks since we were granted exclusive negotiation rights and it has been very rewarding to see the wonderful response from local people
8509821 im very appreciative of the opportunity to finalise the legal paperwork
8509822 were all so committed to the long term future growth of football and of ensuring north queensland is a leading team in the hyundai a league in the years to come
8509823 expansion of the hyundai a league is a critical issue to the continuing evolution and growth of football and this is a very exciting day for ffa everyone involved in the hyundai a league gold coast united and north queensland
8509824 from our point of view we know exactly what we have to do we have to win the game
8509825 its an easy game from that position because we dont have to worry about anything else the key is that we play well and win so its a straightforward exercise for us
8509826 it was a difficult evening the important thing from our point of view is making sure we start better than we did in the last game
8509827 if we do that and if we score then maybe midtjylland will become a little bit anxious and we will capitalise on that
8509828 he trained yesterday for the first time back with the group
8509829 he looked sharp like he had enjoyed the experience and we hope to tap into that
8509830 we had a glimpse of him before he left for the olympics so it was obviously frustrating from our point of view that we havent been able to have him available up until now
8509831 but hes a good player an exceptionally talented young man and hes a good option for us
8509832 he gives us more presence than maybe we had in the first game
8509833 he was with the physios yesterday and obviously went through all the tests he needed to do to ensure that hell be available

8509838 in appreciation her weather underground cell made a threefingered fork gesture its official salute
8509839 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8509840 weve added features that make it fun to spend time with the nav u
8509841 since i came to australia ive been coming and watching and supporting glory
8509842 theyve been one of the best teams in the league back in the day so i want to see that happen again
8509843 it would mean a lot for the club and for perth its been such a great club and its still a great club and hopefully it will be one of the best in australia again
8509844 the real secret of magic is that the world is made of words

8509846 zenit st petersburg will fancy themselves to do really well in the champions league this season
8509847 they beat some top teams in the uefa cup last season so they are no mugs
8509848 there is also a lot of money in the russian game there are plenty of brazilian players over there and people generally dont realise how strong a league it is
8509849 a lot of teams struggle when they go out to russia so that gives them a big advantage as well
8509850 it would be good for european football as a whole if teams from more countries were competitive in the champions league
8509851 porto came from nowhere to win it a few years back and there are good leagues throughout europe that are getting stronger all the time
8509852 there are a number of teams who could win it and it would be no surprise if they did
8509853 if you cannot enjoy the champions league what can you enjoy
8509854 the draw is always an exciting time you look forward to seeing who you are playing whether it is a new challenge and how far you are travelling

8509856 things fall not because they are acted upon by some gravitational force but because a higher intelligence god if you will is pushing them down
8509857 gravity which is taught to our children as a law is founded on great gaps in understanding the laws predict the mutual force between all bodies of mass but they cannot explain that force isaac newton himself said i suspect that my theories may all depend upon a force for which philosophers have searched all of nature in vain of course he is alluding to a higher power
8509858 we just want the best possible education for kansas kids
8509859 closed minded gravitists cannot find a way to make einsteins general relativity match up with the subatomic quantum world
8509860 theyve been trying to do it for the better part of a century now and despite all their empirical observation and carefully compiled data they still dont know how
8509861 traditional scientists admit that they cannot explain how gravitation is supposed to work
8509862 what the gravity agenda scientists need to realize is that gravity waves and gravitons are just secular words for god can do whatever he wants
8509863 anti falling physicists have been theorizing for decades about the electromagnetic force the weak nuclear force the strong nuclear force and so called force of gravity
8509864 and they tilt their findings toward trying to unite them into one force but readers of the bible have already known for millennia what this one unified force is his name is jesus

8509870 the way you treat yourself sets the standard for others
8509871 a lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes
8509872 was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that

8509880 everything i ve learned in eight years as president and the work i ve done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8509881 if i m not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8509882 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8509883 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8509884 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8509885 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8509886 we believe passionately in barack obama s message of changing the direction of our country
8509887 we re not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8509888 theres a definite social stigma still attached to being a sucker
8509889 people associate the label with ignorance and stupidity so suckers are understandably wary of identifying as such while business and government tend to allude to suckers without being explicit enough to offend its a problem because the shame and secrecy makes it more difficult for suckers to fully participate in public life
8509890 as far as i am aware the university plans to make two academic staff redundant at the meeting
8509891 if either of staff are made redundant we will ballot staff for strike action on 26 september
8509892 the university authorities have made a bit of a mess of this thats why the hefcw got its consultants involved
8509893 having created a mess in the first place they risk causing further damage by making people redundant what sort of signal does this send out to potential students and staff
8509894 we continue to act in the collective best interests of the university of wales lampeter uwl to safeguard its short and long term financial viability
8509895 as a result we are facing some very difficult economic decisions
8509896 we are disappointed with the university and college unions ongoing refusal to enter into constructive negotiations with us and with their intended ballot for strike action which only serves to potentially damage the reputation of uwl

8509900 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8509901 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8509902 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8509903 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8509904 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8509905 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8509906 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8509914 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
