7140006 ive got a customer whose lamp doesnt work youve got a bug in the logic that handles time zones in the timer
7140007 well our customer was living in nyc and he moved to chicago when he set it up in his chicago loft it didnt work nyc is eastern time chicago is central
7140008 hmmm couple of questions is the lamp plugged into a working ac outlet and is there a working bulb in the lamp
7140009 oh the customer said that it worked in his nyc apartment
7140010 ok humor me here 1 plug some other electric powered device into the outlet that the lamp is plugged into and verify that it the outlet is delivering power 2 take the bulb out of the lamp and make sure that it works in another working lamp
7140011 what are the things that make this thing fundamentally work
7140012 stop i saw you reaching for the eraser tool or magic wand or whatever
7140013 i could do 10 times better than that guy without even trying
7140014 oh the nephews and vicki are coming back and i want to see them
7140015 we leave at 10 in the morning and walk two and a half miles to the garden says coordinator afi lake
7140016 we go over garden rules talk about the days activities and garden assignments are given out and then we prep the garden
7140017 it was just a natural thing to want to teach the children how to garden
7140018 the children are introduced to foods they normally dont eat at home
7140019 also their science and math skills are built and they learn how to work cooperatively together
7140020 the first year was rough we started out with dirt and now we have soil
7140021 its nice to see kids take ownership of their plants
7140022 weve grown more than vegetables weve grown friendships and relationships
7140023 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india
7140024 on the day he formally announced his candidacy a new york observer story that quoted biden as calling obama
7140025 for a campaign that prides itself on its message discipline choosing biden would be introducing a wildcard into the mix the obama campaign exudes quiet confidence that if they do the basic political work between now and nov 4 the illinois senator will be president do they really want to risk it with biden
7140026 the mccain campain needs to get off the straight talk express and ask for directions
7140027 then neil kinnock happened biden borrowed passages of a speech given by kinnock a leader in britains labour party without attribution a mistake that led to a detailed examination of bidens public statements that turned up several more examples of potential plagiarism and resume inflation the feeding frenzy eventually chased the delaware senator from the race
7140028 the incident has become the stuff of political lore type
7140029 picking biden who has served in the senate for the better part of the last four decades seems to run counter to that core message biden was elected to the senate at age 29 and spent only four years after graduating from syracuse law school in 1968 working in the private sector before entering public life
7140030 biden has long been a regular on the sunday talk show circuit and is one of the pillars of the democratic party establishment his accomplishments of which there are many all were achieved as a senator operating inside the deepest heart of political washington
7140031 one of the most overlooked episodes during the 1987 collapse of bidens campaign was a snippet of footage captured by c span in which the delaware senator in response to a question about where he went to law school and what sort of grades he received delivered this classic line
7140032 there is evidence from the democratic primaries that biden is not only aware of his tendency to go on and on about himself but is also able to curb that natural tendency however
7140033 the statement does not specifically advocate reducing the drinking age but many who signed it say they thought legal drinking should begin at 18
7140034 other than his fingers blake barely moves while playing his feet are set in place and his eyes are locked on the screen as he peers through a mop of curly brown hair gaming for him is serious business its his job

7140044 there are certain traditions in politics that are hard to disturb
7140045 this year superdelegates comprised 20 percent of our national delegation yet the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelegates were until this year
7140046 the role they played in our nominating process actually distracted us from the important issues we were debating

7140051 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
7140052 was part of a bizarre double life his son had been leading
7140053 when michael rang me last tuesday i was on my way to new zealand
7140054 he said dad youve got to come and see me
7140055 i said to my wife maybe the doctors have told him hes only got a few weeks to live
7140056 so we cancelled everything and jumped on the plane and went to see him in melbourne and thats when he told us the story
7140057 we were just in absolute shock and we still are we havent had time to get our head around it he said i dont have cancer ive had two lives that ive lived
7140058 his wife amanda who has been with him for seven years found out the day before we did and shes had no idea
7140059 michael has had a severe addiction to pornography the addiction to pornography started when he was 12
7140060 its horrendous because we dont have that sort of stuff around he was raised in a christian home weve never brought that stuff into our home
7140061 he lived the two lives and he would get sick as a result of the guilt
7140062 he was feeling like he was letting god down letting his family down his church his friends
7140063 hes been living this for so long feeling like hes had these two lives and now hes the one thats come out in the open he confessed it he didnt get caught
7140064 to deal with the guilt he would pour himself into doing good work hes touched the lives of young people all over the world now they are all affected by this
7140065 he hasnt done this for any reasons that have been portrayed that hes a fraud
7140066 it was either keep pretending or come out with the truth and tell everything hes come out with everything but now weve got the consequences of it all
7140067 we have to accept it were hoping to share with our congregation how it all started and how it got where it is
7140068 an addiction like this is not going to be fixed overnight you cant have a 16 year problem and fix it in a week
7140069 they have said to me that he is very ill they are assessing where reality stopped and fantasy kicked in and whats caused all this
7140070 the doctor believes that at times michael was totally convinced that he had this sickness
7140071 when he was about 12 he did vomit all the time hed get really really sick
7140072 he was in the adelaide childrens hospital for seven weeks at one stage he didnt eat and we thought we were going to lose him
7140073 they took out his appendix thinking that it might be that but they realised that it wasnt
7140074 they gave us the option of putting him in a psychiatric ward to see if there was something psychological but we felt uncomfortable with that at the time
7140075 we signed him out from hospital and then he would go a few months and then he would get sick again
7140076 wed always take him to hospital wed always do the proper thing but they couldnt get to the bottom of it until now
7140077 we have watched our son go through what we thought was cancer
7140078 my wife and i over the past two years have watched him vomit in buckets having nosebleeds and even his hair fell out in clumps at one stage
7140079 every time we saw him we saw symptoms he stayed with us for a while where we had to put a special air conditioner in one of the rooms because he would heat up so much in the middle of winter
7140080 he had this cold air conditioner blowing on him to try to keep the heat down as a professional minister ive stood in front of my congregation and cried and said to pray for my son
7140081 ive travelled the world asking people to pray for him can you imagine what a horrible thing it would be if i was playing a game
7140082 to be honest i ask myself as a father what did i miss what did i not do

7140084 since 1982 we have added 25 million plus jobs in this country we will have a larger pie
7140085 people will be fighting over the pie but thats a wonderful thing even if we grow at 1 percent per year we double the gdp per capita in 75 years the pie will grow enough that everyone will get more of the pie
7140086 i have enormous respect for warren but i have to disagree
7140087 i have already taken into consideration that the pie is going to grow
7140088 ja maar ik heb geen ticket voor de veerboot en het kantoor is dicht
7140089 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7140090 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden

7140098 the tree of liberty is sometimes watered with the blood of her patriots
7140099 god bless america help her to stand may she turn to the one who upholds her by his mighty hand praying daily for our nation with his word our cornerstone god bless america my home sweet home god bless america my home sweet home
7140100 if we ever forget that were one nation under god then we will be a nation gone under
7140101 a simple way to take measure of a country is to look at how many want in and how many want out
7140102 i will stand with the muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
7140103 and oh by the way ive noticed that sometimes its spelled koran and other times quran well jimmy crack corn and you guessed it i dont care
7140104 this is what you are to say to the israelites
7140105 you know you have one of the most dangerous jobs in the country do you mind if i pray for you
7140106 no something much worse than that im a music pastor
7140107 im going to pray that god will help you do whats supernatural and only he can help you with that
7140108 strategically speaking i think biden was the best choice he has great veteran experience he has been involved in the democratic party for a very long time
7140109 obama brings vision but joe biden brings ballast and obama needs someone with a lot of experience to work with and bounce ideas off before he moves forward
7140110 one of the biggest things obama is trying to do is build those bridges its not about the democratic and republican ticket after november its about america i think thats what both of them are trying to do
7140111 when you get into governing you kind of lose touch with the real people people who see things they are out there everyday
7140112 how do you feel real comfortable walking across on that little line and 10 inches from you some old hot hood comes up and maybe stops
7140113 you have to get the right amount of roads going out and thats whats important to sioux falls
7140114 this is what the people really want and what they need
7140115 first of all youre kind of depressed once you go on the waiting list the anxiety sets in then every time the phone rings you wonder if thats it
7140116 thats exactly why i come to it because i am a survivor and hopefully to get other people to realize theres life after heart trouble you dont just have to go sit in an easy chair and not do anything
7140117 he couldnt hardly walk down to the corner and he had to sit for awhile so seeing him here today is a miracle for us
7140118 you cant really describe it in words because at one time i didnt think i was going to make it i set up arrangements for my funeral and everything because i thought im not going to be here and now its just a super great feeling to get out and do something like this

7140135 chelsea have agreed terms for andriy shevchenko to return to ac milan details of the agreement will remain confidential
7140136 for me its like winning the champions league there were complications but now everything is resolved im really happy
7140137 after a series of frenetic phone calls during the whole day we reached an agreement with chelsea i have heard from andriy about 48 times in the last three hours andriy made a mistake in leaving and i think after two years he has understood that this is his home now he has made economic sacrifices but at this point what counts is that he has come back to us tomorrow he will be in milan monday he will undergo a medical and then sign a contract we have managed to bring home a player who has scored the most goals in our shirt in the last 50 years
7140138 conseguimos um ponto que realmente n o pod amos deixar passar mas acho que pelo que n s apresentamos dentro de campo merec amos mais o time correspondeu lutou e teve chances at de fazer o segundo gol
7140139 temos que deixar claro que jogamos contra um timo advers rio e que jogava dentro de casa atuamos bem e vamos levar esse jogo para recife como um par metro para o decorrer da competi o
7140140 tivemos v rias oportunidades de matar o jogo e n o conseguimos concluir isso n o pode continuar acontecendo para que n o ocorra novamente o que aconteceu hoje temos que saber aproveitar essas oportunidades para matar os jogos
7140141 oh we have a bunch of flat rocks in our creek you can come and get some if you want
7140142 come look at this tree do you think it is too big to move
7140143 id say this is too big to move without heavy equipment and personnel
7140144 it basically is taking a net and raking it on the bottom and anything that sticks up from the bottom gets bulldozed over it is similar to forest clear cutting

7140149 a bola foi enfiada eu sou goleiro as pessoas pensam que todas as bolas s o do goleiro e n o bem assim se a bola fosse minha eu sairia para pega la ela estava quase fora da rea
7140150 a torcida est impaciente n o sei o porqu desta ira e dessa cisma mas n o ligo mais para as vaias j passei por isso mais de 1000 vezes e provei com personalidade que sou maior do que isso
7140151 foi um lance duvidoso e ele decidiu puxar para o time da casa nosso jogador estava de costas e n o teve nenhuma inten o de tocar na bola com a m o mas o que vale a interpreta o dele aconteceu um lance igual no primeiro tempo quando a bola bateu na m o do luiz alberto e o rbitro deixou passar
7140152 deixar de pontuar nunca bom conseguimos dois pontos em dois jogos fora de casa mas nesse ficou aquela sensa o de que poderia ter sido um pouco melhor valeu pela regularidade da equipe nessas duas partidas e agora vamos pensar no pr ximo jogo na ilha do retiro
7140153 fomos bem hoje conseguimos nos impor na partida mas infelizmente fomos castigados no final do jogo o fluminense teve momentos agressivos na partida principalmente no in cio do segundo tempo e n s conseguimos nos defender bem no fim das contas valeu pelo empate

7140156 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7140157 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7140158 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7140159 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7140160 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7140161 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him

7140175 for the first time in my adult life i am really proud of my country
7140176 jesse jackson won south carolina in 84 and 88 jackson ran a good campaign and obama ran a good campaign here
7140177 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
7140178 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7140179 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7140180 i presume he was sucked down into it and he was overcome by the rush of waters
7140181 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7140182 this wont be much at all if a storm doesnt have a category in front of it doesnt worry us much
7140183 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that
7140184 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7140185 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7140186 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7140187 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7140188 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7140189 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7140190 por amor de deus almoce descansado n s esperaremos por si l fora
7140191 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7140192 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7140193 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7140194 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7140195 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7140196 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7140197 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7140198 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7140199 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7140200 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7140201 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7140202 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7140203 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7140204 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7140205 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7140206 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7140207 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7140208 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7140209 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7140210 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7140211 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7140212 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7140213 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7140214 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7140215 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7140216 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7140217 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7140218 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7140219 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7140220 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7140221 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7140222 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7140223 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era

7140227 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7140228 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7140229 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7140230 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7140231 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7140232 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7140233 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7140234 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7140235 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7140236 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7140237 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7140238 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7140239 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7140240 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7140241 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7140242 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7140243 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7140244 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7140245 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7140246 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7140247 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7140248 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7140249 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7140250 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people

7140260 in 1987 when proffitt was seven months old his father and another family member were killed in a car accident
7140261 roche was left on her own to raise proffitt who has traumatic brain injuries and whose skills are on the level of a six month old child
7140262 i crawled for three days to take care of him
7140263 her son would die at home because he lacked professional care
7140264 to try to tell her story to professional basketball players oprah and others
7140265 we fell in love instantly with the children and the people who reside here
7140266 i was playing and curtis was dancing with the kids i realized then that this is a place i would be connected to long after
7140267 gives us a certain purpose of being that we cant find on a football field a photo shoot or a movie
7140268 we had a conversation we brought him in and he felt if he was given a few more days hed be much better prepared
7140269 he felt the team was playing well without him and it would allow him to get things together which i think is admirable
7140270 the team is playing well and ill take a couple days whatever the decision we made thats what it is
7140271 no they all had these egos where they think they can do anything
7140272 this was a little different situation where the team was playing extremely well
7140273 we had a conversation we brought him in and he felt if he was given a few more days hed be much better prepared
7140274 he felt the team was playing well without him and it would allow him to get things together which i think is admirable
7140275 the team is playing well and ill take a couple days whatever the decision we made thats what it is

7140278 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7140279 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7140280 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7140281 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7140282 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7140283 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7140284 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7140285 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7140286 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7140287 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7140288 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7140289 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
7140290 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7140291 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
7140292 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
7140293 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
7140294 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
7140295 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
7140296 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
7140297 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
7140298 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
7140299 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
7140300 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
7140301 giving special attention to ninth grade is the first order of business
7140302 but then apply the same general principles to grades 10 through 12 so students arent faced with the same problems but just a year later
7140303 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7140304 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7140305 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7140306 instead of having a single major fault or a few major faults we tend to have a lot of very minor and sort of subtle faults
7140307 its a family of faults and that can contribute to the severity of an earthquake
7140308 i try to keep that as independent from my work as possible
7140309 a purely circumstantial speculative argument but while its speculative its within the scientific bounds of reason
7140310 may very well be among the safest places to go during a seismic event
7140311 it basically is taking a net and raking it on the bottom and anything that sticks up from the bottom gets bulldozed over it is similar to forest clear cutting
7140312 should the concentrations of fish move to the north it actually could be harmful to keep us from going where the fish are
7140313 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7140314 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7140315 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7140316 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7140317 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7140318 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7140319 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7140320 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7140321 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7140322 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7140323 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7140324 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7140325 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7140326 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7140327 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7140328 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7140329 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7140330 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7140331 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7140332 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7140333 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7140334 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7140335 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7140336 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7140337 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
7140338 looking for the good of making these children accountable its for the concern of these children getting an education
7140339 there wasnt a dry eye on the unit this morning
7140340 hed been close to death many times but this time he was about as severe as he could be
7140341 i go in once a day and pray for him
7140342 to see him open his eyes and he cant say anything its too much to go through but i let him know ill be here as long as hes here
7140343 last night the whole family sang amazing grace in the room while we were working to save him
7140344 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
7140345 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7140346 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
7140347 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
7140348 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
7140349 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
7140350 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
7140351 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school

7140358 americans like happy stories disaster for the american side does not fit into the larger narrative of american history
7140359 good god what brave fellows i must this day lose
7140360 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7140361 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7140362 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7140363 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7140364 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7140365 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7140366 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7140367 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7140368 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7140369 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7140370 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7140371 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7140372 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7140373 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7140374 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7140375 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7140376 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7140377 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7140378 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7140379 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7140380 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7140381 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7140382 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7140383 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7140384 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7140385 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7140386 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7140387 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7140388 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7140389 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7140390 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7140391 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7140392 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7140393 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7140394 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7140395 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
7140396 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
7140397 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
7140398 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
7140399 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7140400 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7140401 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7140402 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7140403 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7140404 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7140405 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7140406 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7140407 it is with disbelief that we struggle to comprehend the events of yesterday
7140408 provided much needed dermatology care to patients who might otherwise go without
7140409 we are just deeply saddened these are individuals that were highly skilled and very professional in what they do and they will be missed
7140410 he was very well qualified hed flown that plane for hundreds of hours hed flown this route many times
7140411 its a great thing to honor the people on flight 93 by putting together all three attack sites the pentagon the world trade center and pennsylvania
7140412 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
7140413 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders

7140425 antique needs for be met with verbal relating to the motives as to liberals
7140426 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7140427 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7140428 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7140429 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7140430 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7140431 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7140432 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7140433 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7140434 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7140435 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7140436 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7140437 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7140438 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7140439 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7140440 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7140441 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7140442 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7140443 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7140444 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7140445 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7140446 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7140447 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7140448 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7140449 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7140450 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7140451 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7140452 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7140453 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7140454 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7140455 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7140456 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7140457 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7140458 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7140459 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7140460 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7140461 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7140462 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7140463 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7140464 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7140465 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7140466 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7140467 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7140468 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7140469 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7140470 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7140471 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7140472 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7140473 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7140474 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7140475 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7140476 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7140477 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc

7140527 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7140528 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7140529 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

7140535 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7140536 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore

7140542 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners

7140564 today j r me showed how much hes progressed since the start of the season he had to fight hard and he never lost contact with the leaders his fifth place is a great reward for the work hes done over the past few weeks kamuis race was over after a few metres he was hit on lap one the collision was not his fault and he could do absolutely nothing to avoid it but thats the risk when you start from the back of the grid were optimistic for tomorrow and j r me will be gunning for a rostrum finish
7140565 im very happy with this result my best in gp2 i made a good start the teams excellent strategy helped me to gain a place and then i made it a point of honour to keep up the pace to take advantage of race incidents the final twists of the event helped me gain two places and then lose one finally i scored four points and ill do my best to continue in the same vein tomorrow
7140566 i was harpooned just after the start and that was that its been a very diff icult weekend so far and scoring points tomorrow will be impossible ill use the second race to rack up the kilometres on this track to help me get to grips with it better in the future
7140567 both drivers had clean races while many others werent able to do that and it was good to scrape into the top ten we need to capitalise on the finish positions for tomorrows sprint distance its not an easy track to master but if they can keep it clean at the start theres potential for two good finishes
7140568 i am highly disappointed by gp2 in regards to the race length which could have been shortened by one lap our rules do not permit us to refill during the race and we already did everything we could to reduce the fuel consumption its a real shame as we lost 11 very precious points today nevertheless i want to thank all the team and giorgio for the great job they did it was a great race but destroyed by the fact of improper calculations beyond our scope
7140569 its a difficult weekend i thought i could be faster but its difficult the qualifying was going better than free practice and we had the problem located i thought that i could do a really strong race today and also had a good start but a contact in lap 1 meant an early end to my race keeping me from showing what would have been possible today
7140570 we did our best today and i still cant believe what has happened everybody knew about the fuel consumption problem we didnt pass through the pit lane but went straight to the grid we didnt do any practice start and also had a safety car it is actually impossible to realize that we didnt finish the race it is really unbelievable what has happened today and i am not just talking about myself but also others do 32 instead of 34 laps if you know about this problem we did a perfect race and not only did i lose the win but also the point for fastest lap

7140619 i havent gone for it and im making bogey what the hell am i thinking
7140620 i played solid on the front nine i hit a lot of good iron shots and made some good putts
7140621 i was playing good and we had a four group wait on 14 which really took me out of my rhythm right there i kind of righted the ship the next few holes i kept hitting good shots i just didnt get anything out of them
7140622 i dont even know what the cushion is and it doesnt matter
7140623 theres a lot of golf left theres 18 holes and im going to do my best to birdie every one of them
7140624 even when i won here in 04 i didnt look at the scoreboard the entire final round
7140625 i cant stress enough im not a gambling kind of guy anyway i like to gamble but not necessarily when it comes to golf i hit a lot of irons out here i dont need to hit driver very much its not that i dont drive it straight its just that theres no need
7140626 this golf course is a little sneaky it doesnt take a whole lot to make a bogey
7140627 i made one really bad swing but apart from that it wasnt crazy off the wall on the back nine it was just a couple of loose shots off a hair and all of a sudden i was 3 over
7140628 just let it ride i have enjoyed it but this game is very very fickle so i want to enjoy it while i can its been a nice stretch and thats why ive kept playing i was going to take a week off but i figured i was playing well so i may as well keep going
7140629 when you shoot good scores your confidence is going to get up there
7140630 im certainly not going to get ahead of myself by any means
7140631 i cant put my finger on it i would like to be in the lead sometime and telling you how ill stretch a lead out from in front i am coming from behind here and it is a comfortable place for me i guess and well see what happens for me tomorrow
7140632 but there are so many guys there i know tomorrow ill probably have to play a little more aggressively
7140633 i thought if i could get to 8 that would get me within two or three of the lead and i was surprised to look up when i tapped in there to see that the guys had come back
7140634 its going to be a tight race tomorrow a lot of guys and youre going to have to shoot a low one tomorrow probably 4 or 5 under 6 under maybe to win this thing with that many guys close to the lead its going to be a bit of a shootout tomorrow
7140635 i got off to a great start and we were both 3 under through four holes and the greens were soft and receptive as the day wore on the wind picked up i thought there was some really good pin positions out there tough to get close to the hole
7140636 the greens really firmed up and even that little 10 mph wind the big trees it has that augusta feel where you think its going this way and it might go this way and thats the difference between maybe having a 10 footer or a 30 footer so it got a little bit tricky out there near the end of the day
7140637 i am putting a little bit better but i think my overall wedge game is a lot better
7140638 a lot of little wedges that i had into a hole like 5 where you can either drive the green or lay it up well i feel confident laying up because my wedge game feels good and some of the par 5s ive hit some wedges close
7140639 thats probably why ive been playing a little better this week
7140640 obviously it would be a big accomplishment to win the fedexcup
7140641 its right up there wit the world golf championships and moving towards hopefully the majors its obviously young and in its inception here in the second year and its going to keep getting better

7140645 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7140646 but i think its playing really well the greens have been drying out really fast and depending where the pins are tomorrow its going to be a tough day
7140647 that little 10 mph wind with the big trees it has that augusta feel where you think its going this way and it might go this way and thats the difference between maybe having as 10 footer or a 30 footer
7140648 i tried to hit a little 64 degree wedge and it came out and i heard it ding my club on the follow through

7140676 a part of the world where historical grudges run deep and oppressed can become oppressors in the bat of an eye

7140678 you just cant invade a sovereign country in the 21st century
7140679 did you post the thing on your blog yet mom
7140680 i know what we can do for the fourth lets correct everything thats wrong on the internet
7140681 we are having a meeting next wednesday about a lot of things and contracts will be one of the things discussed
7140682 there are other players to discuss as well im fairly relaxed about it but i will know more when we sit down
7140683 these things happen the main thing at the end of the day is that it will be sorted
7140684 i think i can honestly say that if it comes to january then the chances are he wont be staying but i dont think it will get there
7140685 i dont think he did his case any harm today
7140686 i think well keep him i dont want to labor the point ive said my piece
7140687 i think were very close but ill know more then
7140688 the agreement has to be right for both parties but i know he wants to stay
7140689 he has a one in two goals per game ratio for newcastle and probably for england as well that says it all
7140690 im happy i have hoped for a return for a while and yesterday i began to believe that this deal could end well for me it is as if ive won the champions league
7140691 hes a class player with a great goal record he was 75 percent fit and i was going to put him on for the last 15 minutes if we got on easy street which we were never likely to be today
7140692 i had both my forwards damien duff and martins injured and could only have used alan smith in a crisis michael just said give me a long warm up i gave him 20 seconds and he went on
7140693 then he did what he does better than anybody in the world it was a great cross by geremi and this guy does deliver quality
7140694 shay came back from a life career threatening injury how he played i dont know
7140695 we sent him to germany and they did a wonderful job hes come back and hes a young keeper when there are guys like david james 38 van der sar 37 and brad friedel 37
7140696 theres still a lot ahead of shay but he was brilliant today
7140697 it was always going to take something to get us going and to get the crowd going
7140698 for some reason we didnt pass it as well as we can we had one or two players just not seeing things as well as they normally do
7140699 we were stop start so yes the penalty save got the game going and got the crowd going normally its a great pass or individual class or a shot that hits the bar or something but today it was the penalty save
7140700 we have won a game that we were never really looking like we were going to win to get three points is a bonus
7140701 i only want to live in reality and the reality of the situation is that i play for standard i enjoy it and what happens happens
7140702 i have no real idea what is going on but my agent tells me something may happen next week
7140703 lying in bed on a summer morning with the window open listening to the church bells eating buttered toast with cunty fingers
7140704 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7140705 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7140706 it got a little crusty and the wind picked up a little bit but i didnt do very well
7140707 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7140708 that day with tiger was the greatest preparation i ever could have imagined
7140709 i know it will be crazy tomorrow but i guarantee you it wont be quite as big as that day in san diego with tiger
7140710 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7140711 that little 10 m p h wind with the big trees it has that augusta feel where you think its going this way and it might go this way and thats the difference between maybe having as 10 footer or a 30 footer
7140712 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7140713 but i think its playing really well the greens have been drying out really fast and depending where the pins are tomorrow its going to be a tough day
7140714 i tried to hit a little 64 degree wedge and it came out and i heard it ding my club on the follow through

7140910 tuvimos una semana donde trabajamos para corregir algunas cosas y obviamente hay que cortar esta senda de derrotas con un resultado importante porque se viene una semana trascendental ellos juegan bien y dejan jugar y saldr un lindo partido pero para nosotros lo m s importante es conseguir un gran resultado y viene una semana de nueve puntos y tenemos que conseguir una buena cantidad para encaminarnos otra vez
7140911 hay que sacar una buena cantidad de unidades para estar en la discusi n del grupo y a eso le vamos a puntar no apuntamos hoy a siete puntos apuntamos a nueve no hemos perdido ninguno y no podemos pensar en empates el equipo no est definiendo o no est plasmando en el marcador cuando es superior y por algunos minutos los pasa mal y le convierten y en eso dos puntos tiene que mejor este equipo
7140912 were not in any hurry maybe a couple of years
7140913 pr cticamente tuvo una lesi n en el cr neo en la cabeza del lado derecho
7140914 una herida de cinco cent metros de largo con una profundidad de dos cent metros
7140915 el riesgo siempre va a existir pero en esta ocasi n por la coordinaci n de las instituciones y grupos voluntarios el n mero de heridos fue bajo comparado con el a o pasado
7140916 el toro sali por un sitio d nde son sacados los heridos pero afortunadamente fue interceptado por polic as municipales quienes lograron sacrificarlo a balazos
7140917 i will greatly rejoice in the lord and my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation and covered me with the robe of righteousness he hath decked me like a bridegroom and as a bride attireth herself with her jewels
7140918 to get the right word in the right place is a rare achievement to condense the diffused light of a page of thought into the luminous flash of a single sentence is worthy to rank as a prize composition just by itself anybody can have ideas the difficulty is to express them without squandering a quire of paper on an idea that ought to be reduced to one glittering paragraph
7140919 once upon a time in the dead of winter in the dakota territory theodore roosevelt took off in a makeshift boat down the little missouri river in pursuit of a couple of thieves who had stolen his prized rowboat after several days on the river he caught up and got the draw on them with his trusty winchester at which point they surrendered then roosevelt set off in a borrowed wagon to haul the thieves cross country to justice they headed across the snow covered wastes of the badlands to the railhead at dickinson and roosevelt walked the whole way the entire 40 miles it was an astonishing feat what might be called a defining moment in roosevelts eventful life but what makes it especially memorable is that during that time he managed to read all of anna karenina i often think of that when i hear people say that they havent time to read
7140920 yi is going to have to assert himself with yao having such difficulty getting the ball inside
7140921 you know it doesnt do any good if you have 7 6
7140922 yi who will play with the new jersey nets in the nba this season the sixth pick in the 2007 draft by milwaukee traded to the nets with bobby simmons one of his best friends on the team on the bucks for richard jefferson yi with six points and five rebounds in the first quarter
7140923 some significance with yi going to the bench now six points eight rebounds for yi who has to go to the bench three fouls
7140924 i believe they called a foul on china yi is called for his fourth personal foul
7140925 yi is saying i just came back in the game
7140926 yi had a great start to this game six points eight rebounds but he picked up his third at the start of the third quarter and sat down now comes back and picks up his fourth
7140927 yi had a great start to this game then foul trouble put him on the bench and hes not been a factor in the second half
7140928 thats also something hes got to have to deal with how to play with fouls so you dont take yourself out of the game and the calls that have been going against him theyre touch fouls you know when youre getting hammered
7140929 the nba has authorized its teams to launch three distinct digital services by the start of the 2008 09 season in late october video streaming interactive tv and video on demand
7140930 but the service that is certain to create the most waves is the streaming which is one of the reasons why the league is negotiating on behalf of its 30 teams to cut live local deals
7140931 we hope to have a model in place this season said bill koenig nba executive vice president of business affairs and general counsel our opening up of the rights will certainly be done
7140932 the plan would allow viewers to watch live games online within their local market for the first time
7140933 the nba will use geo blocking technology to ensure that people outside of a teams territory will not be able to access its games online to comply with the leagues local marketing rules
7140934 rather than a mere goodwill pr gesture this was an all too rare example of the independent media being taken seriously im not holding my breath waiting for omar minaya or rod thorn to attempt something similar but when the day arrives ill certainly be one of the first to complain about not being invited
7140935 i try to write the parts that other authors miss
7140936 teach me father how to go softly as the grasses grow hush my soul to meet the shock of the wild world as a rock but my spirit propped with power make as simple as a flower let the dry heart fill its cup like a poppy looking up let life lightly wear her crown lik a poppy looking down
7140937 oh thats enough to make such and such i just cant use it for an ironing board cover
7140938 what do muslim women think about their status in islam
7140939 if we dont kill them over there they will kill us over here
7140940 it is with disbelief that we struggle to comprehend the events of yesterday
7140941 provided much needed dermatology care to patients who might otherwise go without
7140942 we are just deeply saddened these are individuals that were highly skilled and very professional in what they do and they will be missed
7140943 he was very well qualified hed flown that plane for hundreds of hours hed flown this route many times
7140944 that kind of thing has happened to her before she is a very nervous athlete
7140945 she is good dont worry shes not in serious condition
7140946 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7140947 we are very confident but i can not give you a percentage but virtually all of it has been removed
7140948 canadians will like the fact that both of them are opposed to the war in iraq
7140949 theyll like the fact that theyre both knowledgeable about world affairs theyll like that obama and biden will take a multinational approach and not an our way or the highway approach to international issues
7140950 the idea that we are not willing to take the prime minister of canada and the president of mexico to the mat to make this agreement work is just a lack of presidential leadership
7140951 certainly obama and biden will take a more aggressive approach to increasing fuel efficiency for automobiles thatll be tough on the auto industry but they can do it and generally they favour a more aggressive approach on environmental regulation
7140952 so right at the top of the ticket you have someone who brings significant expertise in areas that concern canadians
7140953 the leaders of this event do not support what the guy did
7140954 i heard a big explosion and a vehicle in the convoy exploded
7140955 ethiopian soldiers in the convoy started to shoot indiscriminately i ran away but when i came back i saw 38 people had died and 16 injured
7140956 it was a setback but i believe i will be a better person and a better congressman because of it
7140957 the economy health care and energy are on the minds of people today
7140958 were seeing significant progress in iraq through the surge and while there are still significant problems i think this helps me in his quest to retake his lost seat
7140959 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7140960 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7140961 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7140962 theyll knock you out cold for only three hours youll be awake by the time we get there
7140963 wake up man were here and youve been puking on yourself the entire rest of the way
7140964 i started worrying when you began screaming to us about monkeys and lighter fluid
7140965 i will say this our contribution to popular culture this time around is a very very strong one
7140966 look i cant watch it i dont even talk about it it brings me back to that time and it wasnt a good time for me and i never wanted that movie to come out in the first place i feel like its an albatross around our neck i hope this new album will come out and make it clear that weve moved on were much more unified and mature
7140967 drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with tygers of pan tang diamond head and iron maiden
7140968 a chapter has closed here weve purged a lot of stuff from the past
7140969 so after that we wanted to move on we got a new bass player a new attitude and so we told bob we were going in a new direction we started working on songs without any producer at all and that was new for us
7140970 the first one in the studio each morning turning on the lights and the one with the plan
7140971 rick rubin didnt even have keys he wasnt even near the building during the sessions
7140972 all of the things they have done since then end up taking the music into a new place but this way it still holds on to the things that made those albums so powerful
7140973 hes no mediator there is no wobble in what he says if me and hetfield butt heads he will listen and say this is right thats wrong one time we played something new and he didnt like it that makes me want to
7140974 i think we successfully recalled the feelings of master of puppets but with the knowledge of now
7140975 we did a lot of looking forward but we kept looking in the rearview mirror
7140976 even a one degree centigrade global average temperature rise will have a noticeable effect on the primary economic sectors of importance for northern rural communities such as agriculture fisheries forestry and tourism
7140977 so it is imperative that this project provides case studies showing how these communities can build adaptive capacity and deliver real adaptations that provide local economic and social advantages
7140978 everyone wants to play their part in making the olympics a success
7140979 been probably the most articulate critic of obama on the democratic side
7140980 joes comments or criticisms of obama with regard to iraq afghanistan and iran and pakistan were all devastating
7140981 if you remember joe really kind of lectured obama with regard to pakistan when obama talked about invading pakistan so its really a surprise
7140982 perhaps he thought all the things that biden had said would not be noticed
7140983 it may well be though that he thought biden could make up for his shortcomings in foreign policy and certainly joe has having been chairman of the foreign relations committee a pretty strong credential there
7140984 a nice guy hes a liberal democrat who will be a team player for obama im sure
7140985 uugh you look like shit your hair makes you look like a seacreatue go to bed
7140986 the zoo is for loading and unloading only there is no valet parking at the zoo
7140987 the first thing that i would do is call in john kerry bob kerrey
7140988 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7140989 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7140990 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
7140991 id rather slit a vein than vote for john mccain
7140992 made havoc of the church entering every house and dragging off men and women committing them to prison
7140993 breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the lord
7140994 and bring him with you for he is useful to me for ministry
7140995 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the sons of god
7140996 paul could not bear the plots which were going on behind his back and he sought to be delivered from them
7140997 my grace is sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in weakness
7140998 you know acacia youre just about 24 and you should be getting married
7140999 how do you know the gospel is true and authoritative in your life
7141000 god im not sure i believe in you im not sure whether youre really there at all or if you are there im not sure that you really care about me all i know is that people have told me you love me and i need someone to love me for me i need to know its true that you really are there that you really do care and that i can count on you no matter what so what im going to go out on a limb and just decide to believe you are there so please dont let me down show me the truth about you and as i try to live my life your way help me see proof that im not wrong to do that because i really need you to be with me forever
7141001 oh great someone else to fuck this place up even worse
7141002 until this situation that we started by the way is resolved i dont want to pull out of iraq
7141003 over the past 200 years some people have considered that jesus was totally human and others have believed he was totally divine followers of islam accept jesus as a prophet who do you say that he is and why
7141004 someone from your church asks isnt it enough for us to gather together each sunday for worship why do we exist as a church what is the responsibility of the church in our world
7141005 let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for he who promised is faithful and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds not forsaking our own assembling together as is the habit of some but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day drawing near
7141006 to make disciples of jesus christ for the transformation of the world
7141007 the local churches provide the most significant arena through which disciple making occurs
7141008 the expression of the mind and mission of christ by a community of christians that demonstrates a common life of gratitude and devotion witness service celebration and discipleship
7141009 the church as the community of the new covenant has participated in christs ministry of grace across the years and around the world beyond the diverse forms of ministry is this concern that all persons will be brought into a saving relationship with god through jesus christ and be renewed after the image of their creator colossians 3 10
7141010 we cant let you smoke in the courtroom its not realistic

7141020 well hes 15 so i dont think hes been to prison yet
7141021 the rain in spain stays mainly on the plain and it gets increasingly difficult to hide my erection in these shorts
7141022 sometimes i think my memory just steps out of my head and travels around in time this happens when i need to be using it and instead of remembering what i should have during that time i just end up with shit in my brain from 1904 and everything tastes like pennies for half an hour
7141023 my soul is cherry flavored wont you come have a taste
7141024 i think this would make a pretty classy tramp stamp its ye olde tramp stamp

7141030 its probably not a good idea to cut the antlers off
7141031 the only reason im doing this is to get money to get enough heroin to kill myself with
7141032 just hold it stay there just wait for me ok
7141033 and wash yourself in the jordan river seven times and you will be healed
7141034 my father if the prophet had commanded you to do some great thing would you not have done it
7141035 i am not worthy to have you in my house but i know that you have authority over all things a word from you and my servant will be healed
7141036 desiderava fare qualcosa che non lasciasse possibilit di ritorno desiderava distruggere brutalmente tutto il passato dei suoi ultimi sette anni era la vertigine lottenebrante irresistibile desiderio di cadere
7141037 la vertigine potremmo anche chiamarla ebbrezza della debolezza ci si rende conto della propria debolezza e invece di resisterle ci si vuole abbandonare a essa ci si ubriaca della propria debolezza si vuole essere ancor pi deboli si vuole cadere in mezzo alla strada davanti a tutti si vuole stare in basso ancora pi in basso

7141040 do we begin again to commend ourselves or do we need as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you you are our epistle written in our hearts known and read by all men written not on tablets of stone but on tablets of flesh that is of the heart
7141041 you are the salt of the earth but if the salt lost its taste how shall its saltiness be restored it is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trodden under foot by men
7141042 god dammit i wish she would get the fuck up sometimes i just want to shake her
7141043 in christ we are set free by the blood of death and so we have forgiveness of sins how rich is gods grace
7141044 so i think in many cases relocation may not work
7141045 legally our advice is that there is no basis for translocation because the purpose is to protect private property and other legal non lethal methods have not already been tried
7141046 how could anybody say it will be ineffective when they havent done the research
7141047 it takes about 20 minutes to kill a pigeon and it can be horrific
7141048 im now comfortable that weve got a robust trial in the making that will give us some insight into this issue
7141049 we are currently working up a more fully developed version of the project and we would want to involve the widest group of stakeholders to assist the scottish homing union with their genuine problem
7141050 it should however be stressed that this project will be run on a trial basis its effectiveness will be fully assessed before it is taken any further
7141051 there is a danger this move could increase the carbon emissions of the public sector overall and damage the economic viability of our growing renewable energy sector
7141052 the scottish government needs to show it is serious about reaching its targets on reducing carbon emissions and set a good example so far all we have had from them on reducing emissions is hot air
7141053 the government needs to use the public purse as a powerful tool to help catalyse the switch to a low carbon economy which in the long run will deliver cheaper and more secure energy
7141054 changing away from the current 100 deal is clearly giving a confusing signal to the public the snp has shown a good commitment to increasing scotlands renewable energy supply so they need to show they are enthusiastic about using it too
7141055 buying 100 per cent green electricity does not decrease emissions and does not increase the production of renewable electricity
7141056 market conditions led by our renewables legislation means that the demand for green electricity remains significantly ahead of supply paying the green premium is likely to be more expensive and could even push prices up
7141057 there are so many bands and artists that have influenced us throughout the years that i couldnt just pick a few and say were a mixture of those
7141058 the judges decided not to award a panel prize embodying the spirit of the fringe to one act but decided to give it to every comedian performing at the fringe a spokesman for the awards said in a year when theres been much discussion about the true spirit of the fringe it is undoubtedly all the comedians working on the fringe this year who embody that spirit so to honour them their talents their spirit and their drive to become good comedians the panel prize goes to all of them
7141059 earlier this summer timo k jens and lauri got together with a guitar player in a forest cottage in west finland and wrote and arranged some songs it went extremely well and we are very happy with the material the direction and the general vibe in the band
7141060 we now have over 15 songs written and demoed already but probably not all of these will make it to the actual album
7141061 we are happy to confirm that our new guitar player is matias kupiainen he was the only guy we even considered seriously this interesting fellow was born may 11th 1983 and is a native of helsinki finland
7141062 next week j rg and jens will come to finland as we have booked three weeks of rehearsals and recordings in another cottage we will then work more intensely on the songs in a real band rehearsal type of situation
7141063 a hundred times every day i remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labor of others living and dead and that i must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as i have received and am receiving
7141064 i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones
7141065 the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true art and all science he to whom this emotion is a stranger who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead his eyes are closed
7141066 if a equals success then the formula is a x y z x is work y is play z is keep your mouth shut
7141067 i do not believe in the god of theology who rewards good and punishes evil
7141068 i have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal god is a childlike one you may call me an agnostic but i do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth i prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being
7141069 it will be the day after the evening standard closes
7141070 with the sales at a historic low and bulks increasing at a staggering rate the standard bulks look set to overtake paid for sales by the end of the summer
7141071 we are reaping the benefits when utilising some of the stories from the standard and subbing them down
7141072 we have always been in the same newsroom and will always be looking for synergies between the two products
7141073 the crossover between metro london lite and thelondonpaper means you are building in frequency as opposed to a wider audience
7141074 theres a fundamental issue in what we are prepared to pay for it
7141075 i think thelondonpaper will stick with it but i dont see why
7141076 we are still on track to be profitable in five years their profits are a long way off and their tactics are not going their way
7141077 all things god works for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his purpose

7141081 8 out of a bag in victory lane to determine how many cars will be inverted for the start of sundays valley of the moon 100 that means he will start eighth and pablo donoso who finished eighth will start first
7141082 its an amazing weekend it was a new track again and we were really good we tried to catch raphael matos in the qualifying he tested here last weekend so he had a better chance of being good than us so its good that we got the pole we had a good race the car was consistent we didnt have to push it 100 percent it was good to have a race like that
7141083 it was a good race were trying to maximize the points as much as we can this weekend its important that we come out of this weekend with a real chance at the championship were leading the championship by one point so its a good thing richard antinucci finished behind me unfortunately we didnt have enough for franck perera but it was a good race and well make improvements for tomorrow
7141084 we had that great start but unfortunately i had to give way rules are rules i was just following my line and my row on the start we had a better start than the other line with raphael matos on the front row i had to let him by so i let him by i dropped one spot at the end of lap 1 in a weird way and let him by we had good speed at the end i think were there and well make improvements for sunday
7141085 it went well we definitely made some gains in the car particularly at the beginning of the race we definitely had the speed of the guys up front and then as we started getting into the race the front tires just started going off so that was affecting me on the brakes particularly in some of the slower corners i was having a tough time keeping up i fell into the trap of either youre overdriving it a little bit or youre just a little bit slow that was a fine line that i crossed over a little bit too far a couple of times that allowed logan gomez to catch back up a little bit but well make a couple of changes here and i think well have a really good run tomorrow
7141086 we qualified fourth which is a season best for guthrie racing weve got izod on the car for this race so i think its some good luck it was good to qualify fourth weve just got to stay up there i ran into some trouble with another competitor who passed before the green flag you cant do much once theyre by you and then youve got to pass them i ended up making a pass on track for fifth again it was just a tough race well see where the inversion goes and see where well be starting tomorrow there wasnt much passing in the race so maybe we can start up front
7141087 the guys did an incredible job moving past the fire turning the page and moving forward if there is a team that can rebound its team penske they proved it today were happy with every accomplishment that weve made this weekend starting on the front row is big for us were going to continue working hard tomorrow and hopefully have a good finish
7141088 its been pretty clear we have really fast cars on the road courses i think apart from st petersburg weve had the front row every time its been really good also between helio castroneves and myself we really push each other a lot too and thats a big bonus having two really fast cars on these tracks we compare the data after every session and ill pick up a bit where hes strong and hell pick up a bit where im strong and we just try to put it all together so i think that really helps too its great to have team penske sweep the front row again
7141089 its good we carried it through weve sort of been there all weekend in the top three were happy about that i think i could have done a better job in that last run but it does feel good theyre very long races we know its a lot about strategy a lot of yellows fall in this race were just happy weve got two cars up there were doing well
7141090 we were one change behind in the firestone fast six we tried everything and as a team weve come a long way weve been struggling on the road courses so im glad to see were in the top four at infineon you dont want to start worse than the second row
7141091 i think were probably disappointed with our qualifying the car was fairly decent and then on that last qualifying run we tried to lower the car a lot to see if we were just missing and every time i tried to touch the brakes i was locking them up and we couldnt even get within eight tenths of a second of our last run it was worth a try i think we would have only been one spot better maybe in fourth we just didnt have enough for what those two penske cars had we always seem to race a little bit better and were definitely happy with where were at we just have to make sure we can follow up with some points tomorrow
7141092 we had a great first two sessions and i was really happy with the car but at the end we made a mistake with the pressures and the car was sliding all over plus the track got hotter and i just couldnt stay close i think we had a chance to put in a good lap at the end at least to beat scott dixon but i waited a little too long to get a gap and i didnt get to make a run just a terrible session but im happy that the car was good in the first two sessions and were in good position for the race
7141093 im disappointed that we didnt make the firestone fast six for the first time this season i thought we had the potential the mcdonalds car was quick but just a little difficult to drive it was right on the edge all the way around so we couldnt quite put a lap together i think we have the performance to gain some spots but i dont think this track lends itself to overtaking well just have to have a smart race stay out of trouble and keep picking them off one at a time maybe we can overtake but its only if somebody makes a mistake weve seen a lot of people go off around here its a tough track the better your car is the more fuel you can save and the more chance you have of passing people in the pits we just need to make sure the car is good tomorrow morning in the warm up
7141094 were not where we want to be because i think anything other than being in the firestone fast six is a disappointment but the guys did a great job on the car and i think we can race from here tomorrow the engineering staff turned a 14th place car into an eighth place one overnight and we had something for the rest of the field until we got to the slow speed sections of the track we were as fast as anyone in the first half of the lap and i think we could have caused some trouble but we just didnt have the whole package today well work on it some more and get it tomorrow
7141095 it was great that the motorola car was able to make it into the fast 12 i cant believe how close the times were of course i wish that we would have been able to make it into the firestone fast six but we are headed in the right direction hopefully we can keep the car up front and out of trouble throughout the race
7141096 i had my hands full in qualifying today the car was on the edge of grip at both ends we made one little change and we completely tipped the car over from understeer to oversteer it wasnt our best effort today and we would be happier if we were starting a bit higher on the grid the blockbuster star wars the clone years race car is very good though so were confident heading into tomorrow
7141097 it makes your knee feel very unstable its something that ive been trying to deal with hoping it would get better by now
7141098 before i start let me tell you both not to worry

7141210 tragedy tests us it tests our fortitude and it tests our faith heres how joe biden responded he never moved to washington instead night after night week after week year after year he returned home to wilmington on a lonely amtrak train when his senate business was done he raised his boys first as a single dad then alongside his wonderful wife jill who works as a teacher he had a beautiful daughter now his children are grown and joe is blessed with five grandchildren he instilled in them such a sense of public service that his son beau who is now delawares attorney general is getting ready to deploy to iraq and he still takes that train back to wilmington every night out of the heartbreak of that unspeakable accident he did more than become a senator he raised a family that is the measure of the man standing next to me that is the character of joe biden
7141211 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7141212 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind
7141213 turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure then you will understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god
7141214 god wanted his people to live not die god wanted to rescue his people not punish them but they must trust him
7141215 in summary total depravity means that apart from any enabling grace from god our hardness and rebellion against god is total everything we do in this rebellion is sin our inability to submit to god or reform ourselves is total and we are therefore totally deserving of eternal punishment
7141216 13 is anyone among you suffering then he must pray is anyone cheerful he is to sing praises 14 is anyone among you sick then he must call for the elders of the church and they are to pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord 15 and the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick and the lord will raise him up and if he has committed sins they will be forgiven him 16 therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed the effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much 17 elijah was a man with a nature like ours and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months 18 then he prayed again and the sky poured rain and the earth produced its fruit 19 my brethren if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back 20 let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins
7141217 pray for one another so that you may be healed
7141218 come near to god and he will come near to you
7141219 it is also found in matthew 22 36 40 where jesus is asked what is the greatest commandment
7141220 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind this is the first and greatest commandment and the second is like it love your neighbor as yourself all the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments
7141221 it is the supreme law that is the source of all other laws governing human relationship it is the summation of all such laws
7141222 and we know that god causes all things to work together for good to those who love god to those who are called according to his purpose
7141223 ithe thief comes only to steal and kill and destory i have come that they may have life and have it to the full
7141224 satan wields the power of death only insofar as he induces people to sin and to come under sins penalty which is death
7141225 and we know that in all things god works for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his purpose
7141226 so connecting the dots nothing good can come out of us in our flesh
7141227 the chief end of man is to glorify god and enjoy his presence forever
7141228 its interesting to consider how negatively james portrays a life lived without true faith
7141229 christ jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life
7141230 above all love each other deeply because love covers over a multitude of sins
7141231 an act the violation of or want of obedience to the revealed will of god a state absence of righteousness a nature enmity toward god
7141232 love keeps no record of wrongs love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth
7141233 some initial possibilities authors brings about causes controls creates decrees foreordains incites includes within his plan makes happen ordains permits plans predestines predetermines produces stands behind wills many of these are extra scriptural terms none of them are perfectly easy to define in this context so theologians need to give some careful thought about which of these terms if any should be affirmed and in what sense
7141234 somehow we must confess both that god has a role in bringing evil about and that in doing so he is holy and blameless

7141238 as i swore in my wrath they shall not enter my rest
7141239 and god rested on the seventh day from all his works
7141240 my father is always at his works to this very day and i too am working

7141324 diese ganzen anspielungen sind nat rlich lustig wenn man die bez ge kennt

7141326 during the fence i could barely stay in my own skin
7141327 if you had told me that i would only have four victories i would have said thats impossible nobody could do that poorly i would say about five of the bouts i was like screw it im just running at her thats not smart and that didnt work

7141335 how do we market the naval academy to a young achieving group
7141336 we cannot continue to do business the way we have in the past and get their attention
7141337 they can see what happens to america if they dont choose to be leaders
7141338 but it better be a really good story and the graphics had better be good
7141339 it had better be good because comics sell by word of mouth
7141340 it could be very effective if it is realistic if it is all fluff it wont be
7141341 i dont need more applications just to get more applications i need more applications from the underrepresented geography of america
7141342 and i need more from what i consider underrepresented ethnic and racial minorities
7141343 my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee i sing
7141344 i want everyone at the naval academy to be division i leaders
7141345 i didnt change it for a random purpose we changed the meals and the study hours for a specific purpose
7141346 hugh came over to us right at the end and told us heres what were going to do on this serve
7141347 it had a great calming effect it was the correct choice
7141348 were playing for a lot of things and thats one of the things
7141349 im really trying to just compartmentalize whats been going on personally
7141350 its hard you almost have to mentally prepare to come into the gym
7141351 one of the reasons im here is because i know so many more lives are invested in this than just my own i wouldnt be here if i wasnt ready to give it everything i got and be in the right frame of mind
7141352 this is wonderful for our team for the guys its a fantastic achievement and ill embrace it and enjoy it
7141353 but as soon as were done ive got to get to where im needed which is with my family
7141354 because lord knows theyve been having a hard time doing that
7141355 im a fairly reserved person i dont wear my heart on my sleeve
7141356 i wanted to shake the russian coachs hand because it was a helluva of match im not going to run around like a headless chicken its just not me
7141357 this team represents whats good about team sports the sum of our hearts is much greater than the individual aspects of this team
7141358 a bunch of guys playing selflessly a lot of unity and a lot of strength i dont know if that is of any interest to america but thats what theyre missing
7141359 weve had to endure some tough times and were just real happy that our coach is with us right now
7141360 were just so stoked for u s volleyball its a good moment for our sport and our country
7141361 suppose you to choose one person a modern person or a person from another era to travel on you with a cross country automobile trip who would you choose and why what would you hope to learn from him her
7141362 personally i wonder if it matters all that much its a million per cent or whatever in brazil and you can still get taxis and delicious meals sex doesnt stop
7141363 with all the excitement and anticipation of your getaway its important to have adequate travel insurance
7141364 its only when you do the numbers that you realise quite what a waste of money hoarding can be
7141365 es una decisi n voluntaria debido tambi n a su edad el padre para nosotros es un c nsul de la ni ez y la juventud de bogot y esperamos que nos siga acompa ando posiblemente ya no devengando un sueldo pero esa instituci n sin l no creo que funcione lo mismo
7141366 es algo que nos parece muy sospechoso y por eso m s de 30 concejales le enviaremos una carta respetuosa al alcalde samuel moreno pid ndole que revise jur dicamente la continuidad del padre como director del idipron
7141367 el distrito tiene que fortalecer el idipron porque de lo contrario tendr una bomba de tiempo al no existir quien lidere la resocializaci n de los habitantes de la calle y de los pandilleros de la ciudad
7141368 it will be a tough old message from taylor wimpey and bovis
7141369 membership sits at 20 000 abc1 members four times greater than at the start of 2007
7141370 london is looking at numbers that are impossible to justify the price of the games is going through the roof based not on the value potential that is extractable but on the committees ideas of what can be charged which has nothing to do with what you can get as a return it is absurd
7141371 virtually every great moment in olympic history has been recorded on kodak film
7141372 ill thought out inconsistent and could put back investment and expansion of britains airports and infrastructure by years
7141373 building runways in the uk is controlled by the government what the commission has done is drive a coach and horses through government aviation policy we need new runways to ease congestion not different airport operators
7141374 the commission has drawn blood and punished us now people may well start asking whether new owners of the uks airports will make the system work any better
7141375 this is a high quality business that will attract private equity businesses such as bridgepoint cognetas hg capital and montagu
7141376 you gas up the marker put on the mask and walk onto the field it doesnt matter that you failed a test that your girlfriend broke up with you last night or that you got a ticket on the way there your world is right for the next couple hours this is your heaven on earth live it love it
7141377 the problem is that woolworths has diversified away from its core business no one knows why they should go there anymore
7141378 if there is agreement for a deal you might find iceland pays 1 for the stores but takes on some of the pension liabilities and the debt a bit like a dowry or it might be there is a clean share offer but no debt
7141379 its hard to understand what steve johnson can do that trevor bish jones hasnt already been doing
7141380 the price of the games is just going through the roof its absurd london is looking at numbers that cannot be justified if i was a shareholder in the companies that are sponsoring id want to know is this just a personal thing by the chief executive
7141381 in some markets where theres a duopoly theres defensive play
7141382 i do not think that mentality has played a role in 10 years no ones big enough to spend defensively
7141383 we did a full business case on the overall return on investment that satisfied our board bt has been transforming itself from a uk telephony company into a global company and we see 2012 as part of this
7141384 the main benefit to an olympic sponsor is an association with the rings one of the most widely recognised symbols in the world
7141385 by association with the tier one sponsors they become tier one
7141386 theyre a tier two company trying to become tier one just as samsung did 10 years ago
7141387 theyre tier two not like hsbc or citigroup but its better than advertising
7141388 we probably would but wed be just as rigorous in our analysis
7141389 theres no sense from our point of view that this is a philanthropic event
7141390 its going to be very much harder for london if i was trying to sell it in a recession id try to tie some part of the fee to performance
7141391 by 2010 11 the economic cycle should be swinging back up
7141392 as the economy comes out off recession its the best time to grab market share
7141393 we have done well without tv rights for 60 years and will do so certainly for the next 60 years too
7141394 flawed ill thought out and damaging to the future of britains airport industry
7141395 to be constrained at least in the short term by limitations on capacity
7141396 fast emerging super hubs across europe and the middle east paris or schiphol which have four runways each could act as britains hub and would be delighted to do so
7141397 malcolm is a witty nice guy but he is also aggressive youre always conscious that he hasnt got to where hes got to without being a bit hard nosed
7141398 bearing in mind that everyone has said frozen foods is a dead channel for 20 years malcolm has done pretty well out of it i definitely wouldnt write him off in anything he chose to do
7141399 they dont understand what its like in the high street
7141400 all they know is knightsbridge and how solicitors wives like to shop
7141401 he has a shrewd understanding of the british buying public and he knows how to give them a bargain
7141402 there is a mythical view that woolworths has been doing as well as it can in a difficult market but it is clear things could be done better

7141408 by expanding our network with new partners and enhanced services we are able to more broadly distribute content across the web and help existing members find the most relevant content available
7141409 this is a really exciting opportunity people get the wrong impression of cheil in the west
7141410 it is the equivalent of amv bbdo the largest agency in the uk in korea which is now around the 10th biggest economy in the world
7141411 the idea of building a classy network is attractive and we want to build the groups skills
7141412 it is early days but that could be through acquisition or supporting talented groups of people in starting an agency
7141413 channel 4s investment in distinctive content and an enhanced listening experience will help commercial radio tackle the listening gap with the bbc
7141414 to take digital opportunities radio needs to start innovating again
7141415 dab with its potential to provide new services interactivity epgs electronic programme guides colour screens instant music downloads and enhanced advertising can transform the listening experience yet still retain radios core values in an ever more confusing world
7141416 generation lost as weve christened them at channel 4 are digital savvy mobile driven conditioned to on demand environments community focused and acquiring content by all means
7141417 one day all consumers will be like this traditional broadcasting media will no longer be enough to engage them
7141418 channel 4 sees itself as the leading shaper of contemporary culture in todays britain we want to maintain that claim in the face of the massive upheaval that digital technology is prompting in the media landscape
7141419 our strategy is designed to address this transition from analogue to digital designed to evolve channel 4 to meet changing consumer behaviour and opportunities presented by new platforms and technologies
7141420 want to make our distinctive high quality content available to consumers whenever and wherever they want to access it why were embracing radio
7141421 entirely new content not repackaging of existing channel 4 content
7141422 our listeners are used to being able to control what they watch or listen to as these days people are inundated with choice
7141423 allowing them to shape their own content seems the next logical step
7141424 the final decision about use of aspirin must eventually be made after discussion with a healthcare provider
7141425 currently the recommendations in the uk are that aspirin is prescribed after a full risk assessment under medical supervision to those who have established cardiovascular disease
7141426 further robust research is needed before aspirin should be considered as a blanket primary prevention measure in the uk

7141428 which is perhaps not surprising considering the committee is chaired by tory has been john wakeham and also includes two conservative ex chancellors black wednesday lamont and boom and bust lawson
7141429 britain urgently needs a heavyweight economically rigorous report into the economics of migration along the lines of the stern report on the economics of climate change the house of lords report is certainly not it
7141430 polish labourers and chinese cleaners actually make a huge contribution to the british economy
7141431 british fruit would go unpicked or would be prohibitively expensive
7141432 how else would the massive increase in doctors and nurses over the past decade have been achieved
7141433 second because migration makes the economy more flexible it can grow faster for longer without running in to inflationary bottlenecks that means higher living standards for british people and lower mortgage rates
7141434 over the past five years gdp per person a good measure of average living standards has risen by 2 2 a year faster than in any of the other g7 rich countries
7141435 british builders and plumbers have to up their game because there are now polish alternatives
7141436 all the high skilled professionals whom the government and the tories are so keen on depend on a whole host of other less skilled workers office cleaners minicab drivers au pairs waiters and so on
7141437 london would be a local financial centre not a global one if it wasnt open to bankers from around the world silicon fen around cambridge the closest britain has to silicon valley would be much less successful without foreign talent
7141438 a foreign childminder can enable a british nurse to go back to work where her productivity is enhanced by hard working foreign doctors and cleaners
7141439 without immigration ethnic restaurants from curry houses to sushi bars are already suffering from shortages of chefs because of the governments efforts to curb immigration from outside the eu
7141440 ninth and most important in the long term migration stimulates innovation and enterprise and thus faster long term productivity growth
7141441 nobody could have guessed when he arrived as a refugee from the soviet union aged six that sergey brin would go on to co found google had he been denied entry and google not been founded america and the world would never have realised the opportunity that had been missed
7141442 the economic benefits of opening our borders are vast just look at cosmopolitan london the richest place not just in the uk but in europe
7141443 and the rise in british gdp per head has naff all to do with immigration and everything to do with cheap credit watch this space on that one
7141444 the most important question of all of course is where would you like us to put all these people there have been 2 7 million new arrivals since 1997 and 90 of them have stayed in london and the south east they arent spread evenly around the country they go where the work is
7141445 had he sergey brin been denied entry and google not been founded america and the world would never have realised the opportunity that had been missed
7141446 if there was no immigration at all ever that would be a bad thing so it must therefore follow that the more we have of it the better and anyone who doesnt agree is a tory
7141447 ah yes theyre tories so they must be talking bollocks
7141448 labour on the other hand have proven themselves to be nothing but worthy custodians of the country for the last eleven years
7141449 if theyre wrong its because theyre wrong not because theyre tories
7141450 how else would the massive increase in doctors and nurses over the past decade have been achieved
7141451 whats more as the population ages the un forecasts that the share of over 80s in the population is set to double to 8 7 by 2050 the need for care workers will soar
7141452 native workers british builders and plumbers have to up their game because there are now polish alternatives
7141453 where were you between 1979 and 1997 when these particular tories were making an utter horlicks of the economy
7141454 im sure the lords would agree that it is a good thing for people to move from liverpool to london if there are jobs that need filling there the same applies to people moving from warsaw or manila
7141455 if there are 10 people trying to come up with a solution to a problem and they all think alike those 10 heads are no better than one but if they all think differently then by bouncing ideas off each other they can solve problems better and faster as a growing volume of research shows
7141456 i always wondered who picked fruit before the immigrants came fruit used to be cheap too even from the grocers on the corner
7141457 the big problem with trying to control immigration is that a nasty climate of xenophobia is created and the net result is a far more unpleasant attitude all round
7141458 lots of brits are going to live in other welcoming countries and maybe many east europeans will want to get back to their own richer culture
7141459 the big problem with trying to control immigration is that a nasty climate of xenophobia is created and the net result is a far more unpleasant attitude all round
7141460 ethnic restaurants from curry houses to sushi bars are already suffering from shortages of chefs because of the governments efforts to curb immigration from outside the eu
7141461 though to be fair to them they didnt bugger up the economy until the late eighties previously theyd limited themselves to just buggering up peoples lives
7141462 yet retirement homes cannot find suitable british staff even brits with few qualification would prefer to work in a shop so without migration your granny will have to make do with less care
7141463 a foreign childminder can enable a british nurse to go back to work where her productivity is enhanced by hard working foreign doctors and cleaners
7141464 oh my polish baby sitter has made me realise my job isnt that bad now shes here so ill go back to it
7141465 for every mugger pick pocket and thug to have the best pickings a cheap air ticket can provide
7141466 increased council taxation while watching declining services oversubscribed schools overfull surgeries further increased congestion significant increase in uninsured road accidents reduction in wages affordable housing shortfalls these are the effects in part if not majority of unfettered immigration they indeed cause resentment those in favour due to boneheaded ideology of unfettered immigration cast this resentment as mere racism
7141467 i pretty much agree with pl being an immigrant myself i would be daft not to but there is something cold and superficial about the whole piece like someone juggling with people like you would with number
7141468 presumably it is only those fresh off the boat who are prepared to work in these kitchens then
7141469 ahem may i draw your lordships attention to the disastrous monetarist experiment conducted by thatcher and howe between 1979 and 1982
7141470 where are the empirically demonstrable negative consequences of the presence of immigrants in england for common people in their everyday lives
7141471 almost every uk region has difficulties in housing health education and crime because of increased migration according to an official report
7141472 local government association chairman sir simon milton said the official statistics were
7141473 no one has a real grasp of where or for how long migrants are settling so much needed funding for local services isnt getting to the right places
7141474 the speed and scale of migration combined with the shortcomings of official population figures is placing pressure on funding for services like childrens services and housing this can even lead to unnecessary tension and conflict
7141475 the reports were compiled by regional groups including police health and education officials
7141476 our members experience is clear rogue employers are exploiting newly arrived migrants undercutting workers who have been here for generations
7141477 the statements you have cited sum up the general tenor of the debate rather well but they dont actually constitute valid evidence they are just the opinions of different individuals or groups about the subject matter you cannot take them as face value evidence as you do not know what kinds of data or lack thereof and political biases and interests they were based on so where is the evidence all i can see is evidence of intolerance and xenophobia
7141478 i have my doubts that even the majority of guardian reading expats are that keen to avoid the expat scene
7141479 b the only time in history that there was something approaching migration free in both theory and practice namely the us in the daacdes leading up to the first world war it laid the foundations for that nation becoming the worlds dominant power ever since
7141480 i am sure theyd want a few so they could sit down and discuss how dreadful england is but not too many as they are desparately in need of someone elses culture to admire
7141481 perhaps there would be much less opposition to immigration if the people were ethnically and culturally similar to the native inhabitants
7141482 i think some people on here need to lighten up eastern eurpoean women are on the whole are healthier better looking and make better wives
7141483 i told him if obama picks biden ill vote for him
7141484 otherwise ill not vote im not stupid enough to vote for a republican most of us were for hillary clinton but when obama got it we had to switch gears
7141485 we need someone now who can do something our country is such a mess
7141486 oh i work for blizzard have you heard of them
7141487 explicit or implicit commit is not allowed in stored function or trigger
7141488 even if our efforts of attention seem for years to be producing no result one day a light that is in exact proportion to them will flood the soul
7141489 pemimpin pemimpin pas jangan lagi bermimpi pada siang hari untuk memerintah negara ini jika mereka tidak mempunyai kemampuan kalau anda tidak mempunyai rancangan untuk pembangunan rakyat tiada mempunyai kemampuan pengalaman dan tiada ketokohan usahlah berangan angan kosong apakah rancangan pembangunan yang pernah dikemukakan oleh pas untuk kebaikan rakyat ketika parti itu menjadi anggota komponen barisan nasional dulu sejak dulu hingga sekarang pas hanya mampu membuat janji untuk menegakkan itu dan ini dalam ceramahnya tetapi apabila habis ceramah mereka akan balik tidur dan kemudian berceramah dan membuat janji lagi pada malam malam berikutnya itu saja
7141490 has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7141491 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7141492 theres no doubt that some people are going to view this as she is not being accorded respect
7141493 it would be demeaning for someone with more experience to take a back seat
7141494 we love hillary and we love her commitment to the party
7141495 when you get to the end of your rope tie a knot and hang on

7141560 sharks are in deadly strife all over the world and the practice of shark finning is repugnant its simply not acceptable for australian fisheries to be contributing to the international trade in shark fin and collaborating in this global collapse of species i commend the artists who have so generously donated to this important event
7141561 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7141562 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic yeah
7141563 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7141564 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off
7141565 even william hartnell who played the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines i think hell always probably tend to be around 40
7141566 never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line
7141567 never let your name be found in a dead mans trousers
7141568 other towers other turrets protruded from the medieval ch teau they called the temple deceptively religious name but this tower was different larger easily 60 feet in height and black like the inside of a chimney and lord of all its secrets whatever was in there stayed there
7141569 legend has it that if you give vidocq two or three of the details surrounding a given crime he will give you back the man who did it before youve had time to blink
7141570 more than that hell describe the man for you give you his most recent address name all his known conspirators tell you his favorite cheese
7141571 as long as it was great and fantastic then yeah but a film is on for 90 minutes and that is not as important as the series but as long as it doesnt get in the way of the show we could do it
7141572 i would not rule out a film version of doctor who no
7141573 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7141574 shut up just shut up it is easy to find out whats going on with the show we virtually publish the scripts and we film in public
7141575 but in giving things away you become that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7141576 the show is really tough for a superfit david tennant so you might kill somebody who takes on the role in their 60s for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7141577 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7141578 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7141579 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7141580 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7141581 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7141582 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7141583 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7141584 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7141585 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7141586 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7141587 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7141588 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7141589 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7141590 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7141591 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7141592 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7141593 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7141594 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7141595 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7141596 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7141597 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7141598 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7141599 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7141600 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7141601 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7141602 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7141603 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7141604 during my 11 days at steim i did a working prototype of the second incarnation of the

7141628 she was always very active she has always done plenty of walking and she reckons this has kept her fit
7141629 she was the youngest of nine and shes a strong fit woman after my father died she even took up outward bound for the elderly
7141630 we keep phoning the patients to encourage them as the exercise is so agonising but they are so strong minded
7141631 she had a boyfriend at the time with a zimmer frame who could not walk as fast as her though and she was always complaining that he could not keep up with her and how could she do her brisk walking
7141632 it is incredibly important for older people to take regular exercise to stay fit and well in order to maintain their physical and mental health
7141633 exercise can help older people to stay mobile and independent ensure a healthy heart keep weight and stress levels under control and promote better sleep
7141634 short bursts of exercise dont have to be overly strenuous and can make a big difference to an older persons health
7141635 exercise through social activities such as interactive games can also play an important role in maintaining the physical and mental wellbeing of older people
7141636 despite the benefits many older people still arent exercising enough

7141721 sometimes people look like they want to cry when they are paying for their groceries

7141723 my schoolwork is affected because it is too hot and too dark to study inside my home

7141725 unless the government appears to the outside world to be competent and stable which it most certainly does not at the moment foreign investment wont be coming back and economic recovery will be very difficult
7141726 and a bad economy generates support for the insurgency even in pakistan where people on the whole really do not want to be ruled by islamists
7141727 but the extremists are seen as the main alternative to the government so in bad times people turn to them

7141730 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7141731 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7141732 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7141733 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7141734 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7141735 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7141736 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7141737 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7141738 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7141739 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7141740 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7141741 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7141742 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7141743 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7141744 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7141745 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7141746 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7141747 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7141748 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7141749 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

7141760 ah ah no judgements no stink nose give me a minute sean doesnt know yet its actually his lover
7141761 sean doesnt think i know lying sack selfish prick but i say that with all the love in the world he opened my eyes with a whack upside the head
7141762 im still going to beat him with his own arm and feed him his
7141763 stop ang its okay and its my life and im happy or will be soon anyway i think i hope stop looking at me like that and listen please just lis
7141764 ok sissy but im not judging you its him jeeze who the fuck does he think he is oh i know every man he said he didnt want to be
7141765 stop or im leaving this til you calm down do you want to know or what
7141766 stop laughing like that i have no idea what to say but i cant shut up how did you find out
7141767 you might so im not giving more of that away
7141768 no fair does she know who you what you are to sean
7141769 im honest with her as he was dammit im not going to cry over that part anymore got a tissue
7141770 oh sissy im sorry here catch your breath and talk to me i really do want to understand jeeze im sorry please stop dripping in your coffee it doesnt taste good salty
7141771 i suspected something you know something so i followed him i really wanted to call you to come but i didnt want a witness
7141772 you wanna hear this so anyway i followed him and saw her and damn if i didnt know exactly who she was the fucking bitch smiled right in my face when all the time
7141773 i thought you said you were in intrigue over this woman nice mouth
7141774 meh that was then listen so anyway i went shopping where she worked to see if i could figure out what she knew what she wanted we got to chatting if you can believe it we went for coffee at her lunch break and really got to the guts of it it was refreshing really to meet someone who knew herself that well and what she wanted
7141775 not even close ang she actually wanted to know me sean the dork was reluctant not for himself she said but because he didnt think i could handle it all these years and the ass still doesnt know what i want even when i draw him a picture
7141776 so sissy what happened then you havent confronted sean so i know you are up to something
7141777 hell yeah we are up to something and sean will be too by the time were done
7141778 ahh theres the giggle ive missed so so more details if i cant have a life
7141779 well one night i waited to see him with her at her place i just had to know and she loves to put on a show
7141780 shush listen she listened to us on the speaker phone she wanted to see me when it was personal jeeze ang what am i doing this could either be the best thing or the very fuckin worst idea ever
7141781 we have a plan to confront him together show him the woman he really married not his vanilla idea of who i am and we i mean kate and i get to have a night of what she promises will be the best sex ive ever known
7141782 oh can i watch kidding kidding now really about that pod
7141783 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7141784 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7141785 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7141786 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7141787 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7141788 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7141789 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7141790 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7141791 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7141792 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7141793 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7141794 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7141795 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7141796 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7141797 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7141798 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7141799 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7141800 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7141801 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7141802 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7141803 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7141804 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7141805 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7141806 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7141807 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7141808 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7141809 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7141810 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7141811 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7141812 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7141813 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7141814 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7141815 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7141816 wouldnt it be fantastic if we didnt think about where the power was coming from and the power was everywhere
7141817 now the question is if its feasible or not its exciting that theyre also inspired and it seems closer to reality every day
7141818 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7141819 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7141820 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7141821 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7141822 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7141823 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7141824 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7141825 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7141826 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7141827 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7141828 who are open to doing something on the production side
7141829 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7141830 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7141831 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7141832 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7141833 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7141834 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7141835 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7141836 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7141837 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7141838 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7141839 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7141840 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7141841 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7141842 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7141843 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7141844 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7141845 with the exception of a couple of plays thats something were going to work on we didnt work on it much but thats not an excuse

7141891 will i find bliss if i commit wholeheartedly to her lifestyle suggestions
7141892 i didnt think it was possible for her or anyone to do it for an entire year
7141893 if she merely says mary j bliges cd is released today i dont buy it
7141894 in the beginning with some of the suggestions such as the clothes i was like how dare she tell me what to wear
7141895 but recently when i went shopping with my mother i was really excited to fulfil some of the rules i felt kind of proud of myself being handed a spiritual path takes a huge amount of pressure off
7141896 im kind of embarrassed to admit it but i can understand why people want it to be that way
7141897 oprah says you must savour every meal so now i eat more slowly before i just vacuumed up my food
7141898 its about what it really feels like to take oprahs word as gospel and about what robyn learns from this
7141899 i think they want her personal help because they think she has the secret she came from nothing and has a private plane if she has lifted herself up from the horrible background she came from shes got the key when she gives advice its sort of like doling out some of that
7141900 oprahs like the popular girl in school who knows how to emotionally blackmail us
7141901 sometimes when shes giving advice shell say this will make you happy unless you dont have enough self esteem to do it its the illusion of free choice actually its an absence of choice when im told its my fault somethings not working its a little bit of a blow
7141902 a frustration we all feel with oprah over the years
7141903 she is a representative for the average woman yet at the same time she is one of the richest people in the world there was a time when oprah really lived by her own advice and i think that time was 1988
7141904 there have been some nice brownies and i enjoyed the decluttering project
7141905 i hear her comparing herself to something she saw on television commenting on the way a piece of clothing fitted or didnt fit she worries about being shlumpy and the word shlumpadinka gets thrown around a lot
7141906 oprah said isnt it a wonderful thing to have all your dreams come true i dont think there are many human beings on this planet who could possibly utter these words
7141907 i think if i ever get everything i want in life im not so sure id be so excited to wake up each morning its possibilities that keep me moving forward

7142050 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have august 19 2008
7142051 hes been in my office a lot for a guy who never does anything wrong trembley said on his radio show
7142052 you gwan back to your world where everything is perfect
7142053 tu trofeo se queda en tu casa con tu gente
7142054 a partir de las 21 30 hay que estar en el estadio
7142055 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7142056 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7142057 it got a little crusty and the wind picked up a little bit but i didnt do very well
7142058 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7142059 that day with tiger was the greatest preparation i ever could have imagined
7142060 i know it will be crazy tomorrow but i guarantee you it wont be quite as big as that day in san diego with tiger
7142061 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7142062 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7142063 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7142064 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7142065 it got a little crusty and the wind picked up a little bit but i didnt do very well
7142066 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7142067 that day with tiger was the greatest preparation i ever could have imagined
7142068 i know it will be crazy tomorrow but i guarantee you it wont be quite as big as that day in san diego with tiger
7142069 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7142070 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7142071 but i think its playing really well the greens have been drying out really fast and depending where the pins are tomorrow its going to be a tough day
7142072 weve got a three year anniversary coming up next week if you take a look at the mississippi gulf coast today theres still an awful lot to be done there are people who cannot return home or rebuild their houses businesses are shuttered
7142073 cant be ignored and it wont be ignored which is a great thing the focus of my speech is on new orleans but the whole gulf coast needs the attention
7142074 when the winds blew and the floodwaters came we learned that for all of wealth and power something wasnt right with washington our governments response during hurricane katrina is a national shame and yet three years later the government has still failed to keep its promise to rebuild
7142075 sending a message it would be for citizens first in their decision and policy priorities which is a step in the right direction
7142076 the message that were taking regarding katrina is sure it was the greatest national disaster in history but we handled it with a sense of teamwork and are optimistic about how well continue to rebuild the coast
7142077 everyone should be thinking about that excitement and about what that means for our country whichever direction we go in
7142078 but i think were there just to catch the repercussions of the seedier sides of major events
7142079 any public awareness is good because one of the ways we find out about these is through concerned citizens calling law enforcement or the fbi
7142080 its an uncomfortable issue people dont want to think about it
7142081 they might not pay attention right now but maybe later when they hear it on the news it will click
7142082 its more that they feel that im american it doesnt matter where i was born
7142083 im truly very proud to be an american and most definitely very proud to be on the u s team
7142084 but i know georgia has very good relations with other countries and the world is not blind and will not just stand by
7142085 this isnt about international politics khatuna was elected by her peers elected by other athletes khatuna has a great story
7142086 its more that they feel that im american it doesnt matter where i was born
7142087 im truly very proud to be an american and most definitely very proud to be on the u s team
7142088 but i know georgia has very good relations with other countries and the world is not blind and will not just stand by
7142089 this isnt about international politics khatuna was elected by her peers elected by other athletes khatuna has a great story
7142090 its the number one country in the world and im holding its flag
7142091 due to gorgoroths recording schedule the previously announced live dates have been revised dates lost will be rescheduled for next year
7142092 be a mouse again as you have only the heart of a mouse it is impossible to help you by giving you the body of a nobler animal
7142093 take charge of your thoughts so you can do what you will will
7142094 do not judge or you too will be judge for in the same way you judge others you will be judge and with the measure you use it will be measure to you why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye how can you say to your brother let me take the speck out your eye when all the time there is a plank in your own eye you hypocrite first take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye
7142095 good chances for the young no longer exist as formerly
7142096 people with this blood type dont exactly look their age
7142097 if ernest hemingway was going to go big game hunting in africa hunter s thompson wanted to use a submachine gun to hunt wild boar in big sur calif he was dangerous like handling nitroglycerin and he liked to keep it that way
7142098 and if i dont cross the line in second i dont care if people are disqualified or not i didnt deserve a medal
7142099 and if i dont cross the line in second i dont care if people are disqualified or not i didnt deserve a medal
7142100 its like our sport has been plagued with doping people cheating so any time a record is broken or a fast time is run people automatically assume that somebody is on drugs it takes away from the sport it makes me think that people dont believe in hard work anymore
7142101 i didnt think that the tibetan people had the same dream as the communist party
7142102 i dont care about anything pure pure chinese culture or pure european culture i dont think theres anything pure i just want to mix and from the mixture to make something new
7142103 an excellent opportunity for chinese contemporary artists to make a statement and be part of an event that will boost chinas way to the future
7142104 in order to survive and survive well in china you not only have to learn how the read the lips of the government you have to read their mind
7142105 not just because it was banned by the chinese authorities for the olympics
7142106 in every child born there are a multitude of seeds all waiting to be nurtured and watered eventually sprouting roots and emerging from their fertile soil
7142107 training people to distrust messages from their bodily feelings and emotions
7142108 miley cyrus sent me a four page text saying she wants to help me
7142109 we covered this already why didnt you speak up earlier
7142110 i have dealt with the courts before and nobody can force me to refund any money back
7142111 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7142112 everyone wants me to fight k fed because hes a notorious celebrity dad and so am i its for charity
7142113 this looks increasingly like a city under siege as the taleban start to disrupt supply routes mimicking tactics used against the british in 1841 and the soviets two decades ago
7142114 the talebans trying to cut the main roads to kabul to target supplies for foreign forces just like the mujahidin did with the soviets if the highways are cut even for two days it could also create riots in the city
7142115 in no sense have they created or can they make a strategic threat to the government of afghanistan
7142116 were fine for fuel and food with the air power we have and the quality of troops on the ground there is no way they can win
7142117 the death knells of the palestinian cause as the world has known it since 1965
7142118 gloating at the continuous failures to build a new state in iraq hides the inevitable question about the viable alternatives
7142119 es un d a muy desafortunado y triste para nosotros lamento much simo que no hayamos podido cumplir con el objetivo del d a aunque adriana estuvo muy bien preparada para esta competencia
7142120 ten amos mucha posibilidad de traer esa tercera medalla de bronce de carmona para venezuela lo sabemos por el nivel que estamos viendo y porque ella ya le ha ganado a todas las rivales con las que se iba a enfrentar en la repesca hubiera sido una bonita despedida de ella en estos escenarios
7142121 no entendemos este cambio de decisi n pues por reglamento es imposible estamos hablando con el presidente del comit ol mpico venezolano que no pusimos ninguna protesta ante la pelea contra la china porque las decisiones no son revocables no se puede cambiar una decisi n ya dada por los rbitros
7142122 nos vamos con un mal sabor en la boca como algo inconcluso algo que se empez pero que no se termin por razones que obviamente no est n en nuestras manos estas son las cosas del deporte que no nos gustan pero espero que en el futuro se pueda corregir
7142123 adriana carmona est muy tranquila ella es una muchacha con mucha experiencia ten a una preocupaci n no quer a dejar en su conciencia que no hizo su mejor esfuerzo por el pa s pero ella le ha dado todo a venezuela
7142124 inicie bien y luego realic dos jugadas est pidas seguidas en los hoyos 11 y 12 la del 12 fue una de las m s est pidas que he hecho jam s haciendo lo que hice al querer salir del rough desde ese momento fue una lucha para regresar
7142125 me han llamado otra vez de inglaterra lo hicieron para saber como me va en el torneo local y como ser mi situaci n en diciembre ellos pueden ofrecer un contrato por varios a os pero no s bien cu l es el equipo
7142126 s lo he hablado con l no lo he hecho con alguien del wigan o de otro club eso me tiene un poco aguantado porque quiero que me lleve un entrenador para as saber que es seguro que tiene la intenci n de contar con mis servicios en ese equipo
7142127 me llamaron tambi n de m xico para preguntarme si quer a volver aunque no me dijeron el equipo mi ficha sigue siendo del uni n maracaibo esperar a hasta diciembre porque no creo que quieran prescindir de m ahora
7142128 since august five we have added 14 international routes we have 20 wide body aircraft in our fleet now and will add another two soon with this we will further expand our network and add more flights
7142129 as es el b isbol enfrentamos un buen pitcheo y eso determin el partido al final
7142130 aunque al final hubo una jugada que decidi todo el partido la del primer episodio cuando nos pegaron jonr n y anotaron dos carreras peso como una losa el resto del camino
7142131 nosotros vinimos a buscar el oro pero jugamos con dignidad y con el coraz n aunque nos quedamos con la plata
7142132 ahora tenemos que seguir desarrollando nuestro deporte nacional y pensar en el segundo cl sico mundial de b isbol
7142133 pienso que demostramos que el b isbol encaja perfectamente con los juegos ol mpicos
7142134 todo el mundo pudo sentir el entusiasmo de los aficionados y eso es algo que deber n tener en cuanta los m ximos responsables deportivos
7142135 sab amos que el torneo iba a ser dif cil y eso ha quedado demostrado en el campo cuando llegamos al la fase final y el nivel se increment lo que significa que si tu pierdes simplemente se trata del deporte del b isbol y deben comprenderlo
7142136 vinimos a buscar el oro pero jugamos con dignidad y con el coraz n aunque nos quedamos con la plata
7142137 quer a una mejor despedida no ir con la plata porque s lo el oro era el objetivo al ser estos mis ltimos juegos ol mpicos pero lamentablemente no se pudo
7142138 i have hoped for a return for a while and yesterday i began to believe that this deal could end well
7142139 for me it is as if ive won the champions league
7142140 there were some complications but now that everything is resolved i am really happy
7142141 we have succeeded in bringing back home the player who scored the most goals with our jersey in the last 50 years
7142142 andriy made a mistake to leave and i think that over the last two years he has realized that this is his home
7142143 now he has made his financial sacrifices but at this point the only thing that matters is that hes back with us
7142144 i kissed a girl and i liked it taste of her cherry chap stick
7142145 ooh i have a sexuality look my boobs popped out
7142146 es un s mbolo del club un hombre que conoce el medio nacional como nadie
7142147 non li legge sui sondaggi ma li vive in prima persona
7142148 non li legge sui sondaggi ma li vive in prima persona
7142149 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7142150 like so many people around the world i have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration
7142151 to all the participants and to everyone who has supported them so well i send my warmest congratulations
7142152 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7142153 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7142154 i had to actually look around on the mound out there to make sure i knew what i was doing
7142155 you dont think youre gone that long but then you get back on and it seems like youre throwing a mile away but you get that peace of mind to know you can throw it and it still feels good
7142156 hes going to pitch for us again in the big leagues that expectation is there for him i dont really have any concerns we all have tendinitis thats the bottom line you go look at any pitcher in there and he probably has some tendinitis i dont really have any doubts that hes going to pitch this year
7142157 but weve got to see how the rehab goes and where hes at and how much time we have left we just take it a day at a time with joba because this is not someone that you can rush
7142158 i just want to get back in and try to help this ballclub win any way we can do it and try to get us back to where we were
7142159 it was right down there by that tree i remember the day plainly it was a warm summer day she and i were so much in love we walked down to the tree and made love for hours
7142160 yes it was okay until i looked up and noticed her mother was standing right there watching us
7142161 fuel capacity and offload and our 767 200 doesnt fill that bill
7142162 to come up with a proposal that meets this requirement
7142163 in every child born there are a multitude of seeds all waiting to be nurtured and watered eventually sprouting roots and emerging from their fertile soil if we nurture the seeds of love faith non violence compassion and honesty these attributes will grow strong and in abundance however if the seeds of hate jealously intolerance violence fear and envy are watered they too will bear fruit as parents we are responsible for developing a childs view of the world around them the view we create for them will likely follow them through the course of their lifetime we can help them to develop a view of a world of possibilities abundance and magnificent and we can also create a view of an antagonistic world where fear unhappiness and anger predominate
7142164 training people to distrust messages from their bodily feelings and emotions
7142165 he didnt know that song so i sang it for him
7142166 well diane im still standing up in front of people every sunday and singing things that most people wouldnt sing in church
7142167 americas liberal armchair warriors are the useful idiots of the war on terror
7142168 were struggling to find a place where she can be kept under lock and key
7142169 we have to wait and see what the judge decides
7142170 im not ready to take that kind of money out of the county coffers if there are other options
7142171 i think she has shown from the day of her initial arrest to the day of her indictment that shes not a flight risk
7142172 you could turn a gym into a courtroom if you needed to
7142173 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7142174 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7142175 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7142176 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7142177 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7142178 musharraf was a curse on our country he was a friend of america and an enemy of islam
7142179 he will be accountable for his crimes in the next world and in this one too i hope he has done the work of the unbeliever and killed so many innocent muslims
7142180 the army is determined to continue with the war against militants but it can only be won with political backing to convince the people that it is their war and not americas
7142181 the system is the same you see new faces in power but nothing more
7142182 the state has failed in pakistan if people want to do anything here they have to do it for themselves
7142183 washington is asking what the hell is going to happen to the war on terror insurgency is like a disease now in pakistan it is spreading outside the tribal areas and the signs are that it is going to be messy for some time to come the concerns are where do we go from here and how do we deal with those guys who are hiding out in pakistan and hitting our soldiers in afghanistan
7142184 the war is on our soil and our boys are dying we will defend our land we are tough on extremism but we need to have democratic wisdom rather than a martial mindset it is in our interest that this war on pakistan is won by us
7142185 so many things have gone wrong but it was demonstrations by the people that got rid of musharraf and that gives our country a new chance
7142186 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly
7142187 we were still very low very close to the ground
7142188 i saw the watch was not his nor the t shirt
7142189 and then the wind shifted and i felt how the smoke was burning me
7142190 i thought that if there was something wrong the right thing to do is switch planes
7142191 i told my husband they should put us on another plane
7142192 they are nowhere to be found they were accompanied by a somali translator and were to visit parts of lower shabelle region they are believed to have been kidnapped
7142193 we heard that unknown gunmen abducted two foreign journalists a white man and a white woman
7142194 its quite shocking to hear from employees that this sort of behaviour continues to happen she says
7142195 organisations need to realise that bullying and unfair treatment of staff is occurring and could be impacting on their own workplace culture or worse still exposing them to the risk of liability possible fines and even brand damage
7142196 they can be prosecuted for an incident that happens between other staff members as well as for not providing employees with adequate equal employment opportunity and occupational health and safety information and training she says
7142197 managing the risks is about empowering your people to fully understand their rights and responsibilities at work and to feel like they can speak up on inappropriate behaviour without experiencing recrimination as a result evans says
7142198 weve put processes and education in place so people understand the boundaries kyriakou says
7142199 internal employees would talk to their manager if they arent able to get clarity the matter will be escalated in our case to our corporate services general manager
7142200 harris said she would let state officials know right away if the extra money entered her account because
7142201 i am a zionist you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
7142202 ladies and gentlemen my wife jill who youll meet soon is drop dead gorgeous my wife jill who youll meet soon she also has her doctorate degree which is a problem but all kidding aside
7142203 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7142204 i dont oppose all wars what i am opposed to is a dumb war i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and encourage the worst rather than best impulses of the arab world
7142205 hemos venido personalmente a verificar el avance de la obra estamos reimpulsando los proyectos de expansi n de generaci n ste es un clamor de los pobladores de delta amacuro que viene a solucionar de forma estructural las carencias del servicio
7142206 dios sabr nosotros nos cuidaremos pero si es que llegan a hacerlo se van a arrepentir 500 a os porque yo s que as como el 11 de abril que el pueblo se fue a las calles y ellos se escondieron como ratas le pasar a el pueblo por encima a la oligarqu a
7142207 sos son los pitiyankis unos arrastrados no tienen patria son unos ap tridas no tienen moral y gobernaron este pa s durante un siglo desde que echaron a bol var de aqu mandaron a matar a sucre
7142208 showing absolutely no indication theyre going to stop enriching uranium
7142209 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks iran is a threat not only to israel but this is a global threat
7142210 any kind of hesitation is being perceived by the iranians as weakness
7142211 you dont even give them 15 months necessarily you think its a more urgent matter
7142212 t he world cannot afford a nuclear iran and weapons of mass destruction everywhere in this region in the hands not only of states but also of terrorist organizations
7142213 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
7142214 responsible financial institutions and businesses worldwide are taking steps to avoid doing business with iranian nuclear and missile entities as well as with the front companies and cut outs the iranian regime uses to disguise its activities
7142215 these five nuclear and missile entities have been used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions
7142216 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
7142217 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
7142218 they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards
7142219 the issue with iran is not about uranium enrichment it wants to control the region
7142220 the reason for this is that they do not want people to panic
7142221 if there is a nuclear leak from one of irans nuclear reactors we need to have stockpiled iodine
7142222 kuwait must have emergency medical teams ready to deal with such situations who are equipped with supplies ready in all areas of kuwait who are ready to deal with every contingency
7142223 stockpile food and have alternative routes to import food into kuwait
7142224 kuwait would need to procure more trucks for this purpose
7142225 this would require oil tankers equipped to travel in shallow water during the tanker war this was done and proved to be very expensive
7142226 it was successful to maintain the flow of kuwaiti oil but expensive
7142227 powerful forces have historically attempted to control trade via this point
7142228 so they could control traffic through the gulf iran has had this intention since 1971
7142229 the maneuvers that have been carried out recently are held one after another to keep our armed forces prepared and strong fortunately these exercises have shown our great defensive capabilities to the world
7142230 security is a national issue the people expect our courageous armed forces to take even the slightest threats seriously
7142231 what we are talking about here are threats from outside the region
7142232 to all my arab brothers and sisters in neighboring countries i must say that our security is your security and your security is ours
7142233 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
7142234 reserves the right to take whatever action it deems necessary
7142235 would give iran international legitimacy for its programme which it currently lacks
7142236 the americans are not ready to allow us to attack iran
7142237 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress
7142238 it would not be right to talk about these things
7142239 threat to the whole world order and there are many actions to be made in the realm of intelligence and preventive measures
7142240 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
7142241 israel supports international efforts to place pressure on the regime in tehran to cease nuclear enrichment its time for the international community to send a clear message to the iranian leadership only if diplomacy is exercised seriously will diplomacy succeed
7142242 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
7142243 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
7142244 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
7142245 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilization development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behavior in scapegoating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
7142246 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there
7142247 there is a mechanism which is agreed between iraq and these countries on what these countries can do through the meeting of interior ministers of these countries through the expanded neighboring countries conferences which took place in kuwait and anther one that is going to take place in jordan in fall
7142248 we are going to continue these negotiations through diplomatic channels
7142249 we hope that any improvement in the relationship between iran and the u s will help the situation in iraq
7142250 it is noteworthy that despite these groundless allegations to date no single credible evidence has ever been presented to substantiate them
7142251 to the contrary several high ranking iraqi officials are on record stressing irans constructive role in the country and rejecting the solid allegation
7142252 the united states accuses iran because the two countries have as yet not resolved their outstanding disputes
7142253 the accusation is designed to stem irans rising regional influence which the u s itself helped to enhance by overthrowing two of the islamic republics most implacable enemies the taliban and saddam hussein regimes
7142254 in addition during these operations numerous jish al mahdi militia fighters and leaders of jish al mahdi associated highly trained special groups fled to iran where they received sanctuary
7142255 as far as the u s is concerned the accusation has the advantage of undermining irans image in the eyes of iraqi shiites by blaming iran for the nefarious activities of the discredited elements in the mahdi army
7142256 the allegations are also designed to provide credence for americas narrative that depicts iran as a deceitful untrustworthy and hypocritical power which while professing to support the central government in baghdad trains funds and arms iraqi prime minister nouri enemies
7142257 irans role in iraq is a byproduct of u s iran relations
7142258 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq
7142259 the security situation has improved not simply because of the surge but because of a host of other factors including the successful completion of ethnic cleansing in key areas and americas success in buying off former sunni insurgents
7142260 economic conditions the improving performance of the iraqi military the decision on the part of iran to lend greater support to the iraqi central government instead of shiite militias as well as blunders on the part of al qaeda and setbacks suffered by moqtada al sadr
7142261 theres ongoing cooperation between us on missile defense but theres nothing new on that
7142262 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
7142263 we will protect our land and territorial waters with all our might
7142264 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

7142278 irans role in iraq is a by product of u s iran relations

7142282 justifications and pretexts for those us and israel who want to drag the region down a dangerous slope
7142283 who didnt adequately refute claims over iraqs supposed weapons of mass destruction
7142284 israel must on no account attack iran speak of attacking iran or even think about it
7142285 belligerent measures taken by a nation to prevent passage of vessels or aircraft to and from another country customary international law recognizes blockades as an act of war because of the belligerent use of force even against third party nations in enforcing the blockade blockades as acts of war have been recognized as such in the declaration of paris of 1856 and the declaration of london of 1909 that delineate the international rules of warfare

7142287 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
7142288 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though
7142289 the courts position seems consistent with a typical trespass case where defendants are liable even when they have a reasonable good faith but mistaken belief in authority to enter on the plaintiffs land
7142290 a blockade of coastal states that had joined the confederacy at the outset of the civil war the court explicitly ruled that a blockade is an act of war and is legal only if properly authorized under the constitution

7142336 its success alone could have been enough for mr foley to live on the rest of his life but he proved its not always the name when he put forth not just one more but two more top 10 books as well as a childrens book all of them to critical acclaim on the other end of the spectrum would be drek featuring such literary crap as the book written by and even ric flair yes im willing to shit on the legend of ric flair for those looking for yet another reason to look down of the nature boy i only need to point you in the direction of brets book to hear his account of flair stories sadly just a mere week before beginning this book i had just finished the dave batista book i had a few questions answered that i had wondered from time to time about mr batista and sure i learned hes very much a human and flawed like the rest of us bipeds but i also had the chance to to see he is as boring as i am when i first wake up hands clasped together as i prayed that the hitman book would at the very least keep my attention and not force me into a sleepy heap each night as i opened it up to my surprise it surpassed any expectations i could have ever fathomed he surprised me at almost every turn from the admission of steroid and drug abuse to the infidelity within his own marriage and without a doubt the book touches just about every emotion you can imagine book report

7142391 generally the government of west bengal and the people should understand that the end result of what tata is doing will be good for the state and the people of west bengal
7142392 we do not want tata to go we want them to expand
7142393 no its one of those things if its out there and you can get it you know go ahead im certainly not going to get into lars ulrich mode about this
7142394 its well documented i dont even have a computer and i dont get involved in that type of gear
7142395 if people are willing to have faceless cds like that in their collection good for them it would be absolutely ludicrous for a rock star to demand that people pay money for albums because the kids havent got that much money to pay for an album so if they can find it for free go ahead but dont do it on oasis records though because thats against the law
7142396 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty

7142407 voc s sabem do que estou a falar uma frase que me identifica ou com a qual me identificaram sugeri a quando se falou no nome do livro e foi aceite no fundo algo que real que verdadeiro afinal de contas com tudo aquilo que tem vindo a lume sobre algumas situa es do futebol portugu s toda a gente sabia do que eu estava a falar apenas por comodidade ou por conveni ncia ningu m na altura tomou qualquer tipo de posi o ou quis agarrar naquilo que era dito e analisar pesquisar procurar respostas e em face tamb m do apito dourado e de algumas coisas que vieram transcritas na comunica o social as pessoas acabam por perceber que efectivamente nada novo
7142408 nunca fiz mal a ningu m nem desejo mal a ningu m apenas pautei sempre os meus crit rios e a minha actua o pelo interesse das institui es que servia pelo interesse do futebol agora o que penso que os interesses do futebol t m sido muito mal defendidos pessimamente defendidos eu n o aceito nunca aceitei que uma ind stria como a do futebol que gera tanto dinheiro deixe que as suas empresas estejam em grandes dificuldades casos de grandes institui es como o boavista que se v presentemente numa situa o extremamente dif cil ou do farense n o compreendo como empresas que compram por dez e vendem por mil continuam deficit rias o futebol em portugal precisa de uma reviravolta eu dou um exemplo ocorrido h pouco a ta a da liga cujos direitos foram geridos pela liga de clubes viu as suas receitas traduzidas em quase o dobro das da ta a de portugal isto revelador e deveria alertar os gestores do futebol para uma realidade diferente
7142409 h uma s rie de pessoas que est o marginalizadas no futebol porque tomaram no passado algumas posi es de grande independ ncia e est o fora repare no caso dos treinadores o manuel jos foi pura e simplesmente afastado do futebol nacional o manuel cajuda regressou h pouco para fazer um excelente trabalho o toni est fora n o pode ser o que que isso tem permitido que o valor do treinador portugu s esteja valorizado l fora e fragilizado em portugal porqu porque a estrutura em que se apoiam os clubes n o depende de si pr pria depende de outros interesses que se conjugam e entrela am que t m a ver muitas vezes com a imposi o de determinadas regras que s o incompat veis com pessoas que pensam pela sua cabe a
7142410 o futebol portugu s nunca foi capaz na sua hist ria de ser independente em rela o teia de interesses fala se muito nos ltimos 30 anos mas sempre foi assim todos sabem como se processa a escolha dos dirigentes federativos todos sabem tratar se de um processo viciado viciado no sentido de haver interesses que se conjugam haver acordos haver procura permanente de lugares em vez da defesa dos interesses do futebol p blico que a grande disputa n o acontece pelo cargo de presidente da federa o mas sim de presidente da arbitragem isto denunciador de alguma coisa

7142416 it was really amazing there were kids swimming out to see us and boats sailing out to meet us
7142417 it took us a day and a half to get here and most of the activists got seasick but the people here were so happy when we arrived
7142418 they came they were welcomed but what will they do tomorrow they were hoping for a long confrontation with israel now they wont have it
7142419 now that weve come through whats the excuse to keep the third boat out or the 10th boat or the 100th we did break the economic siege of gaza

7142428 o vasco vinha numa fase ruim mas j superou isso subiu de produ o e conseguiu uma boa arrancada
7142429 o botafogo vem numa crescente conseguiu vencer tr s jogos seguidos fora de casa e vem dando conta do recado dentro de casa mas ainda precisamos recuperar alguns pontos perdidos justamente no engenh o como a derrota para a portuguesa 1 a 0 e o pr prio empate com o vasco se tiv ssemos com esses pontos estar amos ainda melhores na tabela por isso importante recuper los nos cl ssicos

7142435 i heard that in 1977 the lap record for formula 1 cars was one minute 13 seconds
7142436 that was 30 years ago and it has taken the sport this long to get to where we are today so we will get faster but
7142437 in a perfect world we would have 35 prototype 1 cars racing but that is not possible so we just have to be careful
7142438 a crowd from the sixties and seventies maybe its because there wasnt a race in toronto this year maybe people didnt get their dose of speed downtown so they came out here
7142439 we wont really know the total until after the event but there are a number of reasons
7142440 yes there could be some motorsport withdrawal going on here but remember there is a star turn to the american le mans series now
7142441 the federal government should stop trying to do everything which it doesnt do well and start doing and doing better the few tasks that only it can handle
7142442 for instance uncle sam has become a nanny state telling us what we can eat and how old we must be to drink more than 100 university presidents have called on washington to reduce the drinking age of 21 maybe they are right and maybe they are wrong but this isnt a job for congress it should be the decision of the 50 states which have very different histories traditions and views of such issues
7142443 republican senator john warner wants to revive the national 55 mph limit but why should politicians in washington decide how fast people can drive in butte montana chicago illinois decatur georgia and lubbock texas the respective limits should depend on local conditions and are questions for the states and local communities
7142444 today the national government seeks to run every school system in america
7142445 washington has nationalized much of the welfare system congress funds everything from left turn lanes to bridges to nowhere across the country it makes no sense to tax all americans ship their money to washington deduct a big handling charge and then have legislators and administrators hand it back with lots of strings attached
7142446 unfortunately both senators john mccain and barack obama believe in an all powerful federal government while they and other members of congress act like city councilmen and state legislators they are failing to deal with national problems
7142447 the deficit next year will run a half trillion dollars the occupation of iraq continues to drag on social security and medicare are heading towards financial disaster the federal government is filled with waste our liberties and privacy are under attack but congressmen and presidents prefer to spend their time on local matters that should be decided by local people

7142465 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
7142466 the siege that the israelis have imposed on gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law it is also immoral
7142467 global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it
7142468 if israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships we will not forcibly resist
7142469 if we are arrested and brought to israel we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums it is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens have when they organise to stand against injustice

7142471 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create deposits and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create deposits
7142472 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set the government at defiance the issuing power of money should be taken away from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
7142473 the government should create issue and circulate all the currency creating and issuing money is the supreme prerogative of government and its greatest creative opportunity adopting these principles will save the taxpayers immense sums of interest and money will cease to be the master and become the servant of humanity
7142474 some people think the federal reserve banks are the united states governments institutions they are not government institutions they are private credit monopolies which prey upon the people of the united states for the benefit of themselves and their foreign swindlers
7142475 it is well that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system for if they did i believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning
7142476 the federal reserve banks are one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever seen there is not a man within the sound of my voice who does not know that this nation is run by the international bankers
7142477 banks lend by creating credit they create the means of payment out of nothing

7142481 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7142482 to all the participants and to everyone who has supported them so well i send my warmest congratulations
7142483 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7142484 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success

7142487 first there is an argument that believes food produced in the same environment as the consumer lives in will lead to the greater health of that consumer based on the foods ability to survive that environment
7142488 second there is the aspect of community building supporting businesses on a local level and returning dollars to the region in order to build strength and longevity in our communities maintaining open spaces and environmental balance third and perhaps most importantly local agriculture has the potential to reduce our carbon footprints thereby protecting and healing the environment as greater demands are placed on our resources it behooves us to consider the ramifications not only for ourselves but for future generations as well
7142489 vlm airlines is honoured to receive this prestigious award which is a powerful endorsement of service from the people that really matter passengers we are dedicated to providing the highest levels of service and strive continually to set new standards
7142490 this award is particularly pleasing in that it demonstrates quality of service and service clearly matter to customers on short haul services vlm airlines were strongly supported in this survey category and were frequently singled out for the high standards of staff service they deliver the award is very much a recognition of the those customer facing staff
7142491 a woman was flying from seattle to san francisco unexpectedly the plane was diverted to sacramento along the way the flight attendant explained that there would be a delay and if the passengers wanted to get off the aircraft the plane would re board in 50 minutes

7142493 no thanks but maybe buddy would like to stretch his legs
7142494 you can go anywhere you want in no other racing game you can do that
7142495 we were pretty disappointed with our record early in the season and we knew we were a lot better team on defence than we had shown
7142496 it was up to us to change that to make no excuses to get out there and do it it was about everyone buying in
7142497 theyve adapted to the conditions very well and it looks as though they have done a lot of work on their defence and come up with some pretty sound tactics they seem a pretty happy side and they want to work for each other the introduction of some young players with self motivation and energy has really helped
7142498 it used to remind me of a holiday station the way it was earlier in the year if they carry on the same way today as they have been doing you will see the markers playing a far more significant role
7142499 one noticeable change is how the players are on the balls of their feet in the defensive line theyve gone from being flat footed and thats nothing but attitude
7142500 we havent worried over the last eight weeks about what others are doing if you did youd be in a bit of trouble
7142501 and now it is up to ourselves we have a little bit of control
7142502 we want to put that myth to bed as we have so many others
7142503 hes one of the biggest wingers in the comp hes showed that when hes on he can tear apart any team some people talk about the fact he drops the ball occasionally but the problem is that when a bloke like him gets his game and confidence up nothing can stop him
7142504 im hoping he has a sound game but hopefully i have a better game than him ive got my hands full this week

7142513 you cant even really say that theres a first do no harm principle involved since there are plenty of examples of problematic vice presidential choices running from johnson alienated kennedys core to bush i alienated reagans core to quayle lightweight boy blunder
7142514 its clear that the obama campaign felt they needed a forceful voice in foreign policy with georgia rekindling thoughts of a new cold war and a bulldog on working class issues expect a lot of foreign policy pronouncement with altoona pa on the dateline
7142515 this is a guy who is on the balls of his heels heres a guy who is lower off in the polls than any president in modern history
7142516 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able bring to the table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7142517 its a good pick for obama for he clearly realizes that more and more voters dont see him with the experience and skills to handle the most important part of the presidency foreign policy
7142518 his problem is folks vote for a president not the vp
7142519 the grey hair maturity and foreign policy credentials help of course balancing obamas benjamin button like campaign where he has grown more innocent and inexperienced before our eyes it is a good safe establishment choice much like dean smith at chapel hill running the 4 corners offense its a great way to protect a 20 point lead the problem is obama doesnt have a 20 point lead
7142520 the associated presss ron fournier the candidate of change went with the status quo he picked a 35 year veteran of the senate the ultimate insider rather than a candidate from outside washington abcs jake tapper obama is running on the slogan change we can believe in but the freshman senator selected as his running mate a six term senate institution senator joe biden of delaware
7142521 des moines register david yepsen its a choice that should help obama in iowa a battleground state
7142522 the best possible pick not only does he of course bring the right resume to the team with respect to foreign and military affairs and crime biden also served as chair of the judiciary committee but hes got the perfect demeanor and skill set hes aggressive and despite his affability hes got a commendable mean streak which is a nice and necessary change after the weak sisters lieberman and edwards picked the past two cycles not just likely gop vp picks romney or pawlenty but mccain too will just get their lunches handed to them
7142523 helps put away pennsylvania he might help because as a longtime backer of israel he has strong jewish support in florida he also attacks well without being mean spirited the downside is that hes not change he helps with foreign policy but obama still has to measure up
7142524 the fighting in georgia underscored the need to bring some foreign policy experience to the ticket its critical that the veep be willing and able to take an axe or at least an ice pick to the presidential candidate of the other party senator obama also needs to improve his performance with lunch bucket and working class democrats biden has spent his career appealing to those voters the obama campaign clearly made the decision that they did not need their veep pick to reinforce their change message and that was a smart move obama brings plenty of change and excitement on his own

7142528 this is very interesting question one that would require a fair amount of modeling work to really probe the issue nevertheless we can say some things based on current work
7142529 there is a lot to say here such that it may be worthwhile for those interested to track down the original nice model papers in nature from 2005 gomes et al
7142530 sure until all of this has been modeled and compared with constraints from the moon and elsewhere i do not think anything can or should be ruled out the lunar basins still have a lot to tell us about how the solar system evolved that is why we need to go back

7142532 knowing the first that in the last days there shall come deceitful scoffers walking after their own lusts
7142533 woe to them that make wicked laws and when they write write injustice
7142534 who having known the justice of god did not understand that they who do such things are worthy of death an not only they that do them but they also that consent to them that do them

7142536 behold this was the inequity of sodom thy sister pride fullness of bread and abundance and the idleness of her and of her daughters and they did not put forth their hand to the needy and to the poor and they were lifted up and committed abominations before me and i took them away as thou hast seen
7142537 for there is no respect of persons with god for whosoever have sinned without the law shall perish without the law and whosoever have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the gentiles who have not the law do by nature those things that are of the law these having not the law are a law to themselves who shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience bearing witness to them and their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another
7142538 whosoever have sinned without the law shall perish without the law
7142539 whosoever have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law
7142540 for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified
7142541 the gentiles who have not the law do by nature those things that are of the law these having not the law are a law to themselves
7142542 who shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience bearing witness to them and their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another
7142543 those who do not accept homosexuality are bigots and intolerant to the diversity of others
7142544 for i have foretold unto him that i will judge this house for ever for iniquity because he knew that his sons did wickedly and did not chastise them
7142545 the children will complain of an ungodly father because for his sake they are in reproach
7142546 therefore you have no excuse whoever you are when you judge others for in passing judgement on another you condemn yourself because you the judge are doing the very same things
7142547 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
7142548 finally it must never be forgotten especially in an age of upheaval and disillusionment that american democracy rests squarely on the assumption of a pious honest self disciplined moral people whatever doubts may exist about the sources of this democracy there can be none about the chief source of the morality that gives it life and substance from puritanism from the way of life that exalted individual responsibility came those homely rules of everyday conduct or if we must those rationalizations of worldly success that have molded the american mind into its unique shape the men of 1776 believed that the good state would rise on the rock of private and public morality that morality was in the case of most men and all states the product of religion and that the earthly mission of religion was to set men free

7142550 my objective this season is not to stay at madrid i want to play in the english league and chelsea have a great team it is an attractive proposition for me and madrid
7142551 the game is scheduled to start at 3pm in macedonia where there is a heatwave right now
7142552 the question is do we want to get to macedonia early and train on whatever surface is available there or train in scotland on our own facilities rather than in 100 degree heat we dont want players going over on their ankles on a hard surface
7142553 as far as i am concerned the 24 hour rule is only there to make sure that teams turn up for their games but we are looking at it again if we dont have anywhere to train it wouldnt do us much good to go out earlier
7142554 as it is its going to be tough they are a good side as they showed against england last year and they will be difficult this is one where we are going to have to be at our very best
7142555 the pitch isnt great and the stadium isnt modern although it is being reconstructed from what ive seen of them they play 3 4 3 the markers get very tight on the opposing strikers and close you down very quickly we have no illusions about this it will be very difficult
7142556 agreed partition is the only option its just a matter of time before you to realize this fact
7142557 my old heart has carried these secret memories so long that it aches with them and would burst if i did not whisper them to you
7142558 when they walk through the valley of weeping it will become a place of refreshing springs where pools of blessing collect after the rains

7142564 one bloke even got invited and went along and said it was great
7142565 its no good sitting there and looking on you have to do the exercises
7142566 it has helped her longevity everyone is amazed by the fact that she got to 100 and that she was in an exercise class
7142567 she was always very active she has always done plenty of walking and she reckons this has kept her fit
7142568 she was the youngest of nine and shes a strong fit woman after my father died she even took up outward bound for the elderly
7142569 we keep phoning the patients to encourage them as the exercise is so agonising but they are so strong minded
7142570 she had a boyfriend at the time with a zimmer frame who could not walk as fast as her though and she was always complaining that he could not keep up with her and how could she do her brisk walking
7142571 it is incredibly important for older people to take regular exercise to stay fit and well in order to maintain their physical and mental health
7142572 exercise can help older people to stay mobile and independent ensure a healthy heart keep weight and stress levels under control and promote better sleep
7142573 short bursts of exercise dont have to be overly strenuous and can make a big difference to an older persons health
7142574 exercise through social activities such as interactive games can also play an important role in maintaining the physical and mental wellbeing of older people
7142575 despite the benefits many older people still arent exercising enough

7142581 i told you she was good sure hope e remembers us little folks when she makes it big time
7142582 we had a conversation we brought him in and he felt if he was given a few more days hed be much better prepared
7142583 he felt the team was playing well without him and it would allow him to get things together which i think is admirable
7142584 the team is playing well and ill take a couple days whatever the decision we made thats what it is
7142585 no they all had these egos where they think they can do anything
7142586 this was a little different situation where the team was playing extremely well
7142587 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7142588 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7142589 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7142590 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7142591 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7142592 vilket parti skulle du r sta p om det var riksdagsval idag
7142593 he has hurt me a lot every time he bathes me he puts things in me he had sex with me more than once its all the time in the bath
7142594 thats the disservice they did to my mom and my family
7142595 to not even give a standard time frame of taking it to a grand jury is ridiculous
7142596 push it forward so that these individuals can try to protect themselves because theyre very vulnerable
7142597 we should have presented it to the grand jury probably in late 2007 or early 2008
7142598 this case regrettably wasnt addressed in a timely manner and we have taken some in house steps to ensure that situations like this do not occur in the future
7142599 when you deal with thousands upon thousands of felony cases occasionally one is going to be mishandled and unfortunately that appears to be the case in this situation
7142600 she displayed symptoms of having just a minor case of alzheimers
7142601 she was able to give me a clear concise description of what had happened to her she was able to identify the suspect in a photo spread and identify him by first name
7142602 and never found a single thing to support what this family was saying
7142603 we are going directly to the grand jury with this case
7142604 slowly as the months went by i felt apparently the case didnt matter
7142605 he was considered one of the finest employees at james l west when this occurred and thoroughly enjoyed his work
7142606 when you couple that with ms doores passing the whole thing is a tragedy anyway you slice it
7142607 of all the cases i have prosecuted in the hundreds over the last 12 years the kind of case that presents the most problems is allegations of sexual assault in a facility where probably the only witness of the crime is the victim herself
7142608 hes one of those people in politics who is very interested in the techniques of politics campaign and strategy
7142609 i had a nice visit about how in the world i would run a campaign against a guy who had all the money in the world
7142610 we had a friendly and encouraging conversation with a lot of discussion about things he thought worked and things to avoid
7142611 he had good questions and a complete understanding of the issues and problems to deal with
7142612 i think joe biden will be a good running mate but picking hillary clinton would have united the party
7142613 i think the country has had its fill of texans
7142614 the reason that jeb bush did not run in 2008 is his older brother had tarnished the bush franchise
7142615 the final montage is clips of americana to the bowie song young americans i dont see how more

7142623 ed freeman was a unique individual hes remembered very fondly in the anvils of the idaho national guard he was sent here by the army in the 60s to be an advisor to us and trained a number of our helicopter pilots back then so he has a lasting affect on the idaho national guard as well as the state of idaho

7142635 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7142636 like so many people around the world i have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration
7142637 to all the participants and to everyone who has supported them so well i send my warmest congratulations
7142638 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7142639 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success

7142653 an individuals sexual orientation like a persons race or gender does not constitute a legitimate basis upon which to deny or withhold legal rights
7142654 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
7142655 are you implying that if my friend bob down the street marries his partner jim im going to start fighting with my spouse
7142656 of course he has hes a six year old boy he says i want to have a daddy i said i can imagine that would be great and would it be easier for them if i were married to a man it probably would

7142659 its one of those things that happen in big towns as well as small ones across the country were just glad it hasnt happened until now
7142660 with inflation running high the middle ground members of the mpc appear unlikely to vote to reduce rates unless market expectations for a cut are widespread
7142661 but downside risks to already downbeat views on activity continue to build and we continue to expect rates to begin to fall later this year
7142662 malcolm is a witty nice guy but he is also aggressive youre always conscious that he hasnt got to where hes got to without being a bit hard nosed
7142663 bearing in mind that everyone has said frozen foods is a dead channel for 20 years malcolm has done pretty well out of it i definitely wouldnt write him off in anything he chose to do
7142664 they dont understand what its like in the high street
7142665 all they know is knightsbridge and how solicitors wives like to shop
7142666 he has a shrewd understanding of the british buying public and he knows how to give them a bargain
7142667 there is a mythical view that woolworths has been doing as well as it can in a difficult market but it is clear things could be done better
7142668 i think music and the cultural aspects of the games will be very important as we move forward to 2012
7142669 i think there is more emphasis on our creativity of the sporting legacy that is left after the olympics and on fun in all these areas where our creativity is leading the world i think we will want to showcase that to the world when they look in on london in 2012
7142670 i hope there will be a team by 2012 it will be team uk i hope we can get an agreement on that
7142671 we are looking at what we can do with the various sites and venues to make sure that we dont have a significant waste of taxpayers money

7142673 shelby07 on the cigarlive forum hopped in his sweet shelby mustang in colorado back in september and drove to the blue havana ii herf in atlanta and he came bearing gifts on the seat next to him was a box of illusione 68s he planned to hand out to the lucky attendees
7142674 yet you did not find the fullness of life in your marriage
7142675 you have hit upon the exact word i was fond of him yes just as i was fond of my grandmother and the house that i was born in and my old nurse oh i was fond of him and we were counted a very happy couple but i have sometimes thought that a womans nature is like a great house full of rooms there is the hall through which everyone passes in going in and out the drawingroom where one receives formal visits the sitting room where the members of the family come and go as they list but beyond that far beyond are other rooms the handles of whose doors perhaps are never turned no one knows the way to them no one knows whither they lead and in the innermost room the holy of holies the soul sits alone and waits for a footstep that never comes

7142683 i filled out the standard entry form for a tourist visa and on that form you have to write where youre headed and that was west virginia and they looked at that and it was suspicion straightaway almost and they made a call and i was just standing there and these two guys came up from homeland security
7142684 they looked through my bags and pulled out a novelty hat that i had how it got there my mum put it in they said have you ever worked for the fbi and i just sort of laughed at them and said no i dont work for the fbi its just a novelty hat
7142685 theyd found an email from a friend of mine that was a joking kind of email about you better not bring box cutters and you know exploding shoes and that sort of thing
7142686 well they actually came up to me and said good news almost we no longer think youre a terrorist
7142687 and they were looking more into the fact that i may just disappear into america and work there illegally they were going from one idea or suspicion to another suspicion and were all over the place at one point they were almost arguing with themselves about what are we going to pin him on

7142699 giocare 11 contro 10 non un vantaggio da poco la squadra in inferiorit si allunga concede spazio specie in questo periodo dove la condizione non brillante per direi che la nostra prestazione stata buona sapevamo che avremmo dovuto avere pazienza e sarebbe stata una partita difficile
7142700 ma anche cossu aveva fatto bene in quel momento avevo bisogno di alternative di giocatori con altre caratteristiche jeda ha fatto meglio quando si defilato sulla fascia stavamo premendo ma allo stesso tempo abbiamo fatto bene a non esporci e avevamo consumato tante energie perch una squadra che attacca fa il doppio della fatica
7142701 abbiamo cinque giocatori di ottimo livello sanno che ci sar spazio per tutti nel corso della stagione e devono tenersi pronti alla chiamata per il bene del cagliari
7142702 gol importante per me e per la squadra personalmente d morale e ulteriori motivazioni

7142785 wahai orang yang beriman diwajibkan atas kamu berpuasa sebagaimana orang orang yang terdahulu mudah nudahan kamu bertakwa
7142786 allah manyediakan bagi mereka azab yang keras maka bertakwalah kepada allah hai orang orang yang mempunyai akal yaitu orang orang yang beriman sesungguhnya allah telah menurunkan peringatan kepadamu
7142787 barangsiapa yang dengan kerelaan hati mengerjakan kebajikan maka itulah yang lebih baik baginya
7142788 yaitu orang orang yang apabila disebut nama allah gemetarlah hati mereka orang orang yang sabar terhadap apa yang menimpa mereka orang orang yang mendirikan sembahyang dan orang orang yang menafkahkan sebagian dari apa yang telah kami rezkikan kepada mereka
7142789 dan siapakah yang lebih baik agamanya daripada orang yang ikhlas menyerahkan dirinya kepada allah sedang diapun mengerjakan kebaikan dan ia mengikuti agama ibrahim yang lurus dan allah mangambil ibrahim menjadi kesayangannya
7142790 barangsiapa berpuasa pada bulan ramadhan dengan iman dan penuh perhitungan maka allah akan mengampuni dosa dosanya yang lalu maupun yang akan datang
7142791 lalu mereka beriman karena itu kami anugerahkan kenikmatan hidup kepada mereka hingga waktu yang tertentu

7142793 try to make her wait as you go through a door so that you go first
7142794 in fact its almost 100 percent more this year than it was the previous two years
7142795 theres no question theres a variety of suggestions that people are in fact returning
7142796 remittances which is the money immigrants send home to mexico have gone down dramatically over the past year again probably part the economy but also part enforcement leading to fewer people being here
7142797 so the mother is saying we should return home with the breadwinner of the family to mexico and the children are saying i dont want to leave im a u s citizen i dont know that country
7142798 since the two of you have been exemplary statues and have brought enjoyment to many people i am giving you your greatest wish i hereby give you the gift of life you have 30 minutes to do whatever you desire

7142802 if you look at jamaica a small island nation they won gold silver and bronze in the womens sprint theyve got world records theyve won the mens the womens 100 and 200 metres and the relay
7142803 this is an exceptionally brilliant nation at the same time a small nation scotland can compete on the world stage we proved that in the olympics and a scottish team at the olympics is the future
7142804 im absolutely passionate about scotland and i want scotland to do well but im also exceptionally proud of team gbs performance in the olympics i dont see why i should be asked to make a choice between those two
7142805 these are not just efficiency savings but real cuts to the health service totalling more than 85m
7142806 i am very concerned that patient care will suffer as a result
7142807 if nicola sturgeon doesnt want to be branded the minister for health cuts she must make the nhs a genuine priority for the snp and find the money to fund it properly
7142808 this is an absurd and inaccurate attack which rebounds right back to the labour party
7142809 despite the tightest funding settlement since devolution the scottish government increased the budget for our nhs above the projected inflation rate
7142810 and money for cutting waiting times and other priorities is extra to the health board allocations
7142811 if it wasnt profitable i wouldnt be able to stand here
7142812 life has a funny way of helping you out when you think everythings gone wrong
7142813 cuando llegu a venezuela y vi por primera vez una botella de coca cola se me llenaron los ojos de l grimas

7142820 he liked the mantra like way that the words and locations flowed i recorded them over the soundtrack whilst listening to the music in my headphones
7142821 a lot of people dont understand the forecast but to them it sounds like a piece of poetry
7142822 i think its comforting to people who dont understand the forecast who are lying in bed imagining these boats being tossed around in the sea and snuggle down feeling glad to be in bed
7142823 playing in these great major tournaments thats always been my dream
7142824 and now i get the chance to play in the u s open and the masters i think its going to be a great experience
7142825 everything i hit everything i putt just falls into the hole and its just amazing
7142826 my caddie and i have talked about that a little bit
7142827 and he says yeah i used to know this guy named happy streelman we used to call him hap because he was always happy and thats my dads father
7142828 weve run into different people and neat stories and situations like that so its kind of cool for them
7142829 my parents had always seen it on the schedule as the paramus event
7142830 and it didnt hit us until a week ago and the more they looked into it my uncle used to be a member here before he moved my grandparents are buried in washington cemetery and my cousin came and watched me last week and told me i was like well thats kind of cool
7142831 i wasnt planning on it being as meaningful of a week as probably as it came to but any week i can share with my parents and friends and as many friends that are in this area thats what its all about the win second place third place its great and all but the end of the day thats all we have is our families and friends and thats whats most important to me
7142832 im interested to see how i kind of react to it and thats what ive been working for my whole life this has been a culmination of many many hours and years of hard work and a lot of miles traveled around many tours around the whole country and even world
7142833 hopefully its just the beginning of many years of this but for many its kind of my first as of right now clubhouse lead going into sunday and if it goes well great and if not im going to try and learn much like i did the day with tiger woods and try to get better tomorrow evening than i am right now
7142834 that day with tiger was the greatest preparation i ever could have managed
7142835 i know it will be crazy tomorrow but i guarantee you it wont be quite as big as that day in san diego with tiger which was amazing
7142836 playing in these great major tournaments thats always been my dream
7142837 and now i get the chance to play in the u s open and the masters i think its going to be a great experience
7142838 everything i hit everything i putt just falls into the hole and its just amazing

7142840 toll roads have seen traffic fall as much as 16 percent
7142841 are being adversely affected by more than seven months of volatile fuel prices economic weakness and inflationary pressures
7142842 the key to maintaining financial flexibility during the current environment is for a combination of rate increases and cost cutting measures
7142843 so many of our dreams at first seem impossible then they seem improbable and then when we summon the will they soon become inevitable
7142844 ok may be arsenal and united will screw up too
7142845 lets find some calm water with good visibility and just relax
7142846 on distant generis stands an especially dark dense and near impenetrable growth of sallap trees for many generations it was necessary to travel a long distance around the forest to reach the glorious deep water lake on the far side but then a sith lord thought to blaze a trail directly through the trees in the hope of providing a quicker route to the lake as you might imagine only a few have taken both routes and lived to tell of their experiences but all agree that while the path through that dark wood is shorter it actually fails to arrive at the lake whereas the path that skirts the forest though long and arduous not only arrives at the shore but is in itself a destination

7142850 musharraf was a curse on our country he was a friend of america and an enemy of islam
7142851 he will be accountable for his crimes in the next world and in this one too i hope he has done the work of the unbeliever and killed so many innocent muslims
7142852 the army is determined to continue with the war against militants but it can only be won with political backing to convince the people that it is their war and not americas
7142853 the system is the same you see new faces in power but nothing more
7142854 the state has failed in pakistan if people want to do anything here they have to do it for themselves
7142855 washington is asking what the hell is going to happen to the war on terror insurgency is like a disease now in pakistan it is spreading outside the tribal areas and the signs are that it is going to be messy for some time to come the concerns are where do we go from here and how do we deal with those guys who are hiding out in pakistan and hitting our soldiers in afghanistan
7142856 the war is on our soil and our boys are dying we will defend our land we are tough on extremism but we need to have democratic wisdom rather than a martial mindset it is in our interest that this war on pakistan is won by us
7142857 so many things have gone wrong but it was demonstrations by the people that got rid of musharraf and that gives our country a new chance

7142861 what were you thinking was going to happen when you started sipping that first drink
7142862 you knew better and you have no one but yourself to blame because you knew this was going to happen eventually

7142874 the good name of the chief minister and that of the government owned company have been marred by the report
7142875 thats all he wanted was to have his mother his father and his sister be applauded for what they have done behind the scenes which no camera could ever catch
7142876 no matter how many hours you live eternity is far more important john told me that many times
7142877 it basically is taking a net and raking it on the bottom and anything that sticks up from the bottom gets bulldozed over it is similar to forest clear cutting
7142878 should the concentrations of fish move to the north it actually could be harmful to keep us from going where the fish are
7142879 we have to see what are the amendments proposed we can talk only after that but we will not accept any prescriptive amendment
7142880 there is an attempt by ireland new zealand and a few other countries to incorporate the hyde act conditions in the nsg draft but our stand remains the same
7142881 i think that magazine shows with a strong talk show element like ours are a dying breed and most talk shows these days are comedic vehicles theres jonathan ross or paul ogrady
7142882 the arena in which the conversations are taking place is much more of an upbeat entertainment circus we come from a journalistic school and our approach to interviews is quite linear although we can go off piste quite a lot
7142883 i think that has an absolute place but sometimes that kind of questioning can become slightly relentless to a listener or viewer
7142884 in my experience a confrontational approach tends not to yield the answer you are going for when finnegan asked clinton about her husbands affair you could see up until then the interview had been conducted with a clear pane of bulletproof glass between them and it just came down
7142885 if you are really confrontational to someone obviously the animal response is to pull right back and put up defences to me that is not an interview lots of people think that that gladiatorial style is the way to go with politicians i personally dont
7142886 if you go on a reality show you surrender all freedom of will you are manipulated and controlled
7142887 i cant think of anything worse than surrendering my privacy and my dignity
7142888 i couldnt bear it i will never do a reality television show psychologically it is absolutely merciless
7142889 celebrity culture is a reality and celebrity has become currency in a way that it wasnt when we started it carries a huge comets tail of issues and short term value
7142890 i diritti umani rendono loccidente inefficiente e non gli consentono di raggiungere gli elevati standard organizzativi e artistici di cui sono capaci i cinesi gli interpreti occidentali lavorano solo quattro giorni e mezzo alla settimana fanno due pause al giorno per il caff ma poi non sono nemmeno in grado di stare bene allineati i cinesi riescono a realizzare in una settimana quello che gli europei fanno in un mese

7142898 retired actually he put in his twenty in the air force
7142899 i dont think so well at least he doesnt know you his name is patrick brennan
7142900 well actually he owns his own company i needed some work done at the house last year and the old one we used to use went out of business so i found pats company in the yellow pages one of his guys came out and did the work then a couple days later he knocked on my door to make sure i was happy with the quality of the work i guess one thing sort of lead to another and here we are getting married in two months
7142901 i didnt say a thing i have the utmost respect for plumbers you remember that one and only time i tried to replace a leaky pipe
7142902 how could i forget we had six inches of water in the basement before you found the right valve to shut the water off
7142903 exactly as i said i have the utmost respect for plumbers
7142904 yeah a civilian consultant weve known each other for years starting seeing each other about a year ago
7142905 i dont know jack part of me would love to have pat and the kids move in but
7142906 yeah two beth is nine and david is 7 pats a widower
7142907 you know thats a good neighborhood for kids good schools and the houses got plenty of room
7142908 its okay jack you love her part of you will always love her
7142909 for a minute i wanted i wanted my life back all of it i wanted all the things she and i dreamed about i wanted my house and my yard and kids playing in it and i wanted my wife back god i wanted her back so much it hurt
7142910 im not an expert but i think that sounds like a pretty normal reaction to me from what youve told me the two of you had a great marriage before well before charlie died your splitting up was never about you not loving each other and i think maybe her news today just brought some of that to the surface
7142911 i realized that i didnt think of you once when i was wanting those things
7142912 i wasnt part of your life back then jack it was a different time
7142913 i know that daniel but after she left this morning i felt like i cheated cheated on her with you cheated on you with her i dont know how to do this

7142915 i dont know how to be in love with anyone but her but i am and i do love you
7142916 i think you do know how to be in love with someone other than her because weve been doing it for a while now and i think were pretty good at it personally jack our relationship can never be what you had with sara the same as it can never be what i had with share but it can be what we make it and you need to know that i love you too and nothing will ever change that
7142917 i heard a lot of good things about you pat nice to meet you

7142933 the fragile wave of days they break against the shore of all these years
7142934 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7142935 thats where we are today in the middle of a financial crisis with the economy sliding into recession with monetary policy at maximum easing and fiscal transfers impotent
7142936 more than a year into the most challenging financial crisis of our times we now face a complex and interlocking combination of rising inflation declining growth tightening credit conditions and widespread liquidity tensions

7142947 puasa adalah perisai yang akan menjaga diri dari api neraka sebagaimana perisai kalian yang dapat menjaga serangan musuh dalam peperangan
7142948 sesungguhnya puasa itu dapat menjadi perisai dari neraka karena ia mencegah keinginan nafsu sedang neraka dikelilingi oleh nafsu tersebut
7142949 oleh karena itu seorang muslim yang berpuasa hendaknya menghindari hal hal yang membatalkan dan mengurangi nilai pahala puasanya
7142950 hai para pemuda barangsiapa yang mampu untuk menikah maka menikahlah karena dengan nikah engkau akan dapat menjaga mata dan memelihara kemaluan jika belum mampu maka berpuasalah karena dengan puasa nafsu seksmu akan terkendali
7142951 tidaklah seorang hamba itu berpuasa sehari di jalan allah kecuali allah akan menjauhkan wajahnya dari api neraka tujuh puluh tahun
7142952 berpuasalah karena puasa itu akan mendapatkan pahala yang tiada bandingnya
7142953 puasa dan al quran akan memberi syafaat kepada seorang hamba pada hari kiamat puasa berkata ya allah saya telah menghalanginya dari makanan dan syahwatnya maka berilah aku hak syafaat untuknya
7142954 sesungguhnya di dalam surga ada pintu yang bernama ar rayyan pintu kesegaran dimana nanti di hari kiamat orang orang yang berpuasa akan masuk lewat pintu itu dan tiada seorang pun yang dapat masuk lewat pintu itu selain mereka
7142955 barangsiapa yang masuk pintu ar rayyan maka akan minum darinya dan barangsiapa minum darinya maka tak akan dahaga selamanya
7142956 hai orang orang yang beriman diwajibkan atas kamu berpuasa sebagaimana diwajibkan atas orang orang sebelum kamu agar kamu bertaqwa yaitu dalam beberapa hari tertentu barang siapa di antara kamu hadir di negeri tempat tinggalnya di bulan itu maka hendaklah ia berpuasa pada bulan itu
7142957 islam didirikan atas lima sendi 1 bersaksi tidak ada tuhan melainkan allah dan muhammad utusan allah 2 menegakkan shalat 3 mengeluarkan zakat 4 menunaikan ibadah haji dan 5 puasa pada bulan ramadhan
7142958 tiga orang terlepas daripada hukum orang yang sedang tidur sehingga ia bangun orang gila sampai ia sembuh dan anak anak sampai ia baligh
7142959 barangsiapa yang lupa sedangkan ia berpuasa kemudian makan dan minum maka hendaklah ia menyempurnakan puasanya sesungguhnya allah telah memberinya makan dan minum
7142960 barangsiapa yang muntah sedang ia berpuasa maka ia tidak qadha tidak batal dan barangsiapa yang menyengaja muntah maka hendaklah ia mengqadhanya
7142961 tidakkah manusia itu kehilangan kebaikan selama ia mempercepat berbuka puasa
7142962 nabi saw berbuka sebelum shalat dengan ruthbah kurma tua apabila tidak ada maka berbuka dengan kurma apabila tidak ada beliau berbuka dengan minum beberapa teguk air
7142963 wahai tuhanku karena engkau aku berpuasa dan akrena rizqi mu aku berbuka dahaga telah hilang urat urat telah berair segar dan mudah mudahan pahalanya ditetapkan
7142964 barangsiapa yang memberi makanan untuk berbuka kepada orang yang sedang berpuasa maka baginya mendapatkan pahala seperti orang yang berpuasa itu tanpa mengurangi sedikitpun dari pahala orang yang berpuasa tersebut
7142965 hai orang orang yang beriman diwajibkan atas kamu berpuasa sebagaimana diwajibkan atas orang orang sebelum kamu agara kamu bertaqwa yaitu dalam beberapa hari tertentu
7142966 didirikan agama islam itu atas lima dasar yaitu bersaksi bahwa tiada tuhan melainkan allah dan nabi muhammada adalah utusan allah mendirikan shalat lima waktu mengeluarkan zakat puasa bulan ramadhan dan melaksanakan haji ke baitullah bagi yang mampu jalannya
7142967 bulan ramadhan bulan yang didalamnya diturunkan permualaan al quran sebagai petunjuk bagi manusia dan pnejelasan penjelasan mengenai petunjuk itu dan pembeda antara yang haq dan yang bathil
7142968 setiap amal bani adam yang baik dibalasi sepuluh hingga tujuh ratus kali lipat
7142969 rasulullah saw sangat menganjurkan untuk beribadah shalat sunnat pada malam bulan ramadhan tetapi dalam hal ini beliau tidak mewajibkannya dan selanjutnya beliau bersabda barang siapa yang beribadah shalat sunnat pada malam bulan ramadhan dengan penuh keimanan dan hanya mengharapkan pahala dari allah swt maka diampuni dosanya yang telah lalu
7142970 barangsiapa yang berpuasa pada bulan ramadhan kemudian diikutinya berpuasa enam hari di bulan syawal adalah orang tersebut seperti berpuasa satu tahun
7142971 berpuasa di hari arafah menghapuskan dosa dua tahun yaitu dosa satu tahun yang telah lalu dan dosa satu tahun yang akan datang
7142972 berpuasa pada hari asyura adalah menghapuskan dosa dosa satu tahun yang lalu
7142973 amal perbuatan itu diperiksa pada setiap hari senin dan kamis maka saya senang diperiksa amal perbuatanku sedangkan saya sedang berpuasa hr tirmidzi
7142974 ya abu dzar apabila engkau berpuasa tiga hari dalam satu bulan maka berpuasalah engkau pada tanggal tiga belas empat belas dan lima belas
7142975 saya tidak pernah mengetahui melihat rasulullah saw menyempurnakan puasanya satu bulan penuh kecuali pada bulan ramadhan dan saya tidak pernah mengetahui pada bulan bulan yang lain berpuasa lebih banyak selain dari bulan syaban
7142976 sesungguhnya rasulullah saw telah melarang berpuasa pada dua hari yaitu hari idul fitri dan hari idul adh ha hr muttafaq alaih pada hari tasyrik yaitu tiga hari pada tanggal 11 12 dan 13 dzulhijjah sesudah idul adh ha
7142977 hari tasyrik itu adalah hari makan minum dan menyebut nama allah swt
7142978 sesungguhnya allah azza wa jalla meringankan bagi musafir puasa dan separo dari shalat dan bagi wanita hamil dan menyusui ia meringankan puasa
7142979 dan wajib bagi orang orang yang berat menjalankan puasa jika mereka tidak menjalankan puasa0 membayar fidyah yaitu memberi makan orang miskin
7142980 tidak apa apa bagi wanita yang ingin mencicipi rasa cuka atau apa saja yang akan dibeli
7142981 suatu hari gairahku timbul lalu aku mencium isteriku padahal aku sedang berpuasa
7142982 hari ini aku telah melakukan perkara besar aku telah mencium isteriku sedang aku berpuasa
7142983 bagaimana pendapatmu apabila kamu berkumur dengan air sedang kamu berpuasa
7142984 rasulullah saw pernah mencium aku dan mencumbu mubasnyarah dalam keadaan berpuasa hanya beliau adalah orang yang paling mampu mengendalikan hajatnya hr jamaah selain

7142987 in short we can say that it is now clear that the first half of the age of oil draws to a close it has lasted 150 years since the pioneering wells were drilled in pennsylvania and on the shores of the caspian the growing supply on cheap oil based energy that has marked this epoch led to a rapid expansion of industry transport trade and agriculture allowing the population to expand six fold exactly in parallel with oil it also gave rise to an explosion of financial capital which led in turn to the subject of economics by which to understand and manage money now the second half of the age of oil dawns meaning that the supply of this priceless commodity which underpins our entire way of life will decline towards eventual exhaustion along with all the many other things that depend upon it it probably heralds the end of economics as current understood some see this as a doomsday message but others have confidence that human ingenuity will be able to adapt and even find better solutions the challenge comes in the transition which promises to be a time of great international tension time is short to make the critical changes and adopt new mind sets to match the new situations it is hoped that the pages of this new study will provide basic insights that will help people understand their predicament in order to plan and prepare

7143060 a solid choice that adds political savvy national security experience and a pit bull campaigner to obamas ticket
7143061 is one of congress most knowledgeable and respected voices on national security
7143062 brings far more to the ticket than foreign policy experience he has a powerful personal story and bidens record in the area of crime and the judiciary is another asset democrats can point to that will go beyond his foreign policy credentials

7143075 he told how ron and rachel solved the problem temporarily by wiring themselves into the circuit making it tolerable for other humans by acting as buffers for the energy when they were wired into the circuit others could go through the gateway and time travel lieutenant colonel harry kane was the first one to successfully go through the machine in that manner this was an exciting scientific breakthrough and many excursions were made into the past and present doing research on the nature of time itself
7143076 soon regular trips were being made every week howling wolf told us the problem was that ron and rachel needed to be wired into the circuit for the entire time that the operative was gone and it was very draining on them personally that meant the operative could not stay in the past or future for an extended period of time the way ron and rachel were able to the military needed operatives to spend larger portions of time away on missions the military was intent on seeing if it was possible to alter history for political power and influence at least that was the military dream ron and rachel refused to take part in any tampering or deliberate altering historical events
7143077 howling wolf really had everyone in the room listening to him i saw several faces on the city council that were almost pure white it was obvious he was telling us the truth then he told us ron and rachel remained the only ones that could successfully be wired into the circuit of the machine lieutenant colonel harry kane and his wife tried it with disastrous results she died and he was paralyzed for life ron and rachel were devastated and howling wolf said it was then they refused to cooperate with any more experiments involving the machine they already knew time travel without the machine was possible and much safer they believed there must be some safer way of initiating time travel to an unknown location without the machine
7143078 it was about a week after their refusal to participate that their bodies were supposedly found floating in the lake by lt col harry kane howling wolf explained to us how this could not be true since harry kane had just been paralyzed and was still in the hospital trying to deal with the loss of his wife he had suffered a serious mental breakdown at that point
7143079 howling wolf swept his eyes around the room looking at each of us he said the simple truth was that ron and rachel kane were taken prisoner and wired permanently into the machine against their will so the military could continue to operate it by being hard wired into the machine longer missions were made possible so operatives could be gone for days at a time
7143080 howling wolfs face became very ugly and dangerous it was frightening he said this came at a terrible cost to ron and rachel and the drain on them was so strong they needed to be kept alive artificially his voice grew low as he told us that now after all these years of being wired into the machine ron and rachel are dying and the federation is desperate to find replacements for them they know ron and rachel were conducting independent secret research with a small group and are searching for them and for the secret location where they used to meet the rogue attacks are field operatives seeking for the old secret meeting places and actively discouraging clansmen from being near the lake at all then he said tobal crow and llana must be protected at all costs so they dont end up dying in the same machine ron and rachel are trapped in he was just telling us what the federation has been doing with their time travel program when he stopped
7143081 there was a gasp from the room as howling wolf grasped weakly at a knife that was protruding from his chest then he faded and was gone four city council members were grappling with the city council member that had thrown the knife trying to subdue him the general was staring white faced at the blood on the floor where howling wolf had been standing
7143082 we turned to look at the person that threw the knife just as blood erupted from his mouth and he sagged lifelessly to the floor protruding from his back was a second knife the four that had been struggling with him stepped back wide eyed as they realized one of them was a murderer we were all shocked and didnt know what to do
7143083 the mayor was the first to act telling everyone to stay where they were and called the police the general was already gone and no one remembered seeing him go the police and medics came within minutes but it was clear the city council member was dead the four other city council members were taken away by the police the mayor looked visibly shaken by what had just happened and turned to look at us
7143084 he said things were much more serious than he had believed he asked to postpone the meeting till next month he said the city council needed to do some investigating on its own first he also said he was inclined to believe our story in the light of recent events then he asked us to make certain howling wolf was alive and give him medical treatment if he needed it the last thing he said was that howling wolf must be kept alive at all costs
7143085 with that the meeting was adjourned and we immediately flew to the village in search of howling wolf but were not able to locate him failing that we returned to the base at the mountain and made a report to the circle of elders
7143086 i immediately left to find crow and let him know what had happened crow was with his newbie when i landed and walked over i told him what had happened he immediately excused himself and sat down on his pack near a tree he appeared to be going into a deep trance and suddenly disappeared i didnt know what to do the newbie was looking at me with wide eyes i decided to set up a camp and start a meal hoping crow would come back
7143087 it was about two hours later that crow suddenly appeared sitting on his pack at the base of the tree he looked tired and angry
7143088 someone didnt want him to talk have you talked with llana about this

7143222 this god was perfect and removed while this god loved humanity gods love was conditional it was only actualized for the right kind of follower this god was opposed to most of humanity this god was primarily concerned with the obedience of his subjects basically this was the greco roman hybrid god
7143223 the story that lets us know that we are created in the image of god as partners and collaborators with god
7143224 our rules that were just clarified say that our delegation will vote for the national convention candidate who received the most votes in the primary
7143225 if that candidate is john mccain that is who they are bound to vote for
7143226 encourage all released and uncommitted delegates to cast their votes for sen john mccain at the convention
7143227 the decision today had nothing to do with personality and has everything to do with simply interpreting an ambiguity in our rules
7143228 the state delegates overwhelmingly wanted our utah delegation to vote for romney it was pretty clear
7143229 so my intent was to follow the will of utah voters and the will of the utah state delegates

7143302 i know i havent spent a lot of time learning the ways of washington
7143303 but ive been there long enough to know that the ways of washington must change
7143304 one of things we know is that youve got to have people who can bring about change
7143305 unfortunately change is going to have to go through capitol hill and youve got to have somebody who is knowledgeable about capitol hill the difference between john mccain and joe biden is that one is on the side of change and one isnt
7143306 i think a lot of voters will say there are two washington insiders on the ticket i think most people feel our federal government has been very responsive in recent years and they want something new i hope senator john mccain will pick a governor or former governor someone whos had experience out and about in america
7143307 with all due respect to our 50 governors being president of the united states is much different than being a governor and they have to say well hes been there a long time and of course they also admit in private that biden was their worst nightmare they know hes going to have strong republican support
7143308 thanks id probably go for bruce schneier jim fruchterman eric brewer dave patterson
7143309 hes done it to us several times you cant stress enough that the hero stuff sometimes works in the world but it doesnt work here
7143310 protect us through the caution laps of life refueling us with joy to make it to the finish line of life
7143311 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7143312 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7143313 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves

7143315 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7143316 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7143317 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7143318 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7143319 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7143320 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7143321 please tell me that you did not throw away the rest of the beans
7143322 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7143323 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7143324 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7143325 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7143326 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7143327 its one of those things that happen in big towns as well as small ones across the country were just glad it hasnt happened until now
7143328 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7143329 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7143330 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7143331 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7143332 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7143333 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7143334 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7143335 and please do not quote what an employee of ea has said i could just as well believe the world to be flat and it probably also will be before ea regains the trust of the consumer
7143336 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7143337 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7143338 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7143339 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7143340 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7143341 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7143342 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7143343 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7143344 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7143345 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7143346 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7143347 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7143348 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7143349 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7143350 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7143351 6 in the air with your right hand it cant be done
7143352 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7143353 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7143354 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7143355 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7143356 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7143357 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7143358 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7143359 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7143360 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7143361 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7143362 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7143363 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7143364 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7143365 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7143366 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7143367 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7143368 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7143369 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7143370 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7143371 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7143372 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7143373 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7143374 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7143375 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7143376 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7143377 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7143378 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7143379 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7143380 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7143381 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7143382 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7143383 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7143384 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7143385 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7143386 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7143387 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7143388 the problem is that the higher the burden of taxation the less opportunity there is for growth if you want to get further growth then the state has got to take less from people in tax as you reduce the levels of taxation you will get growth
7143389 just as the country is having to tighten its belt clearly we are going to have to look at priorities for public expenditure
7143390 we have reached the limits and in my view we have got to make economies i think we have reached the end of the road the british people are well ahead of the politicians on this and know that the money is not being spent wisely
7143391 it is up to the leadership of the conservative party how they present these things but the facts of life are if you allow public expenditure to grow more rapidly peoples living standards will continue to fall and our ability to recover will diminish
7143392 therefore we need to do in government what people are doing in their business and private lives which is to cut our cloth
7143393 obviously a conservative administration will have to undertake a policy of economic recovery im afraid its going to get worse before it gets better
7143394 the situation now is the result of this governments overspending overborrowing and overtaxing
7143395 there are areas where you could stop spending on unnecessary programmes which will start to relieve pressure we can cut back on things
7143396 it would be good to hear that the conservative front bench team has decided to put this particular phrase out of its misery
7143397 the challenge is how do we get our economy running again and the answer is to stop taking so much out of peoples pockets in tax
7143398 everyone wants me to fight k fed because hes a notorious celebrity dad and so am i
7143399 you have to go get a trainer i have to register with the mature boxing association

7143418 baugur believes they have a solution to woolworths problems on the table but they need to talk it through with the company they are keen to do something
7143419 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7143420 you cant change america when you supported george bush 95 of the time
7143421 we dont have to have four more years of george w bush and john mccain
7143422 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7143423 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7143424 i think it solidifies the party it solidifies the country behind barack obama
7143425 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
7143426 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
7143427 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7143428 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of each of those countries within the first year i was elected president absolutely positively no
7143429 and so ive believed for a long time a view shared by my republican colleague john mccain and many others as well that we need more force in iraq thats not a popular position to take but we need more force now in order to have less force later we need to gain control of security in iraq
7143430 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the ceasefire agreement
7143431 insisted it was important that russian troops present at the poti senaki area should withdraw as soon as possible
7143432 why do they want to take control of poti maybe they want to grab poti from us while we are still alive we will not allow them to stay here
7143433 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7143434 we think its going to remain a tropical storm theres not a zero chance of a hurricane but its very small
7143435 no es pol tica de su gobierno meterse en asuntos internos de otros pa ses
7143436 tenemos confirmada la presencia de seis presidentes para el pr ximo d a lunes y uno de ellos es daniel ortega que al ser un invitado del gobierno y pueblo de honduras pues va a gozar de todos los beneficios los honores y el respeto que su alta investidura como presidente electo de manera libre y democr tica en la hermana rep blica de nicaragua le merece
7143437 por la mala reputaci n moral que ha alcanzado por el supuesto abuso sexual contra de su hijastra
7143438 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the us of america joe biden
7143439 i see that you have been hurt in the past and god is going to give you a good marriage the lord is going to fill you with his joy and put finances into your hands
7143440 what are you doing are you crying whoa girl whats up you are crying for real
7143441 you have been worried about your brother and god wants you to know that he is going to be okay
7143442 dont worry about the car situation god is going to take care of it
7143443 i have not kept my own vineyard but my beloved has blown upon it with the east wind
7143444 additionally if china was in conflict with the us and decided to sell off a lot of its treasury bonds china would suffer a huge blow to their economy due to the loss of a significant amount of money from selling the bonds prior to maturity
7143445 at the moment the party leadership cannot gauge the sentiment on the ground how many of them feel discontented about the matter
7143446 therefore we cannot say for certain whether the majority of members have the same views with delegates from perak and kedah who expressed their views that gerakan should leave the bn
7143447 at the same time the party leadership on their part can impart the message to the grassroots that the party has made a commitment to the bn since 1973 and that it will remain as a loyal member within the coalition
7143448 some of the interviewees are single parents raising their child on welfare some suffer from sexually transmitted disease each of them gave their opinion on what they would have changed if they could only turn back time
7143449 the programme is a character based abstinence curriculum that helps youths to make the right choices the curriculum teaches them about self esteem the importance of abstinence marriage and the family
7143450 we would conduct surveys at the start of the programme to find out what they think about premarital sex unfortunately when we asked them when would be the right time to have sex many replied night time instead of after marriage
7143451 so in the programme instead of just having someone to give a talk we encourage discussions about the consequences of saying yes and saying no
7143452 theyd realise that saying yes to sex before marriage has a lot more issues involved than if they had said no it gives them a better picture of the negative consequences of premarital sex
7143453 by the end of the programme we are quite happy to say that 92 per cent of the participants pledged to abstain from premarital sex
7143454 pakatan rakyat was formed with the understanding that anwar would be the alternative prime minister
7143455 if there is no such understanding then pakatan rakyat will collapse
7143456 we have not been formally informed of pas stand on this issue
7143457 it was not raised in the pakatan rakyat meetings and as far as we are concerned it is still status quo about anwar
7143458 at the same time we are committed to realising political equality equal economic opportunity and socio economic justice in the country
7143459 we believe in the two coalition system that leads to a functioning democracy where there are as many alternative views as there are alternative political parties

7143466 they couldnt look farther into the future than the next edition
7143467 where disagreement over conversion leads to divorce the new changes will help both parties deal with issues pertaining to custody maintenance and alimony
7143468 section 3 of the law reform marriage and divorce act can easily be amended to allow the act to continue to apply in civil marriages even when one spouse converts to islam
7143469 the spouse who converts can use the act to get a divorce and the other party can still get all the rights under the act
7143470 the party who converts should be allowed to apply for divorce
7143471 in that way he or she can resolve matters with his or her non muslim family because when the civil court grants a divorce to the non muslim spouse the court can also make orders for custody maintenance division of property and so on
7143472 but so long as the circular is not retracted our hands will continue to be tied
7143473 genuine tourists will naturally have money with them and would have booked hotel rooms
7143474 we dont see what is wrong with asking a tourist coming into the country to show proof that they are here as travellers as checks like these are conducted at immigration counters all over the world
7143475 the internet does have its positive aspects but parents should not be too trusting and too naive they should pay more attention to their childrens activities
7143476 the ngos have a better link with the people as they work on the ground and they are willing to share their information and resources
7143477 even my coach has commented that i am attending too many functions i am also worried that after all the attention i would be criticised if i do not perform at the japan open i just want to focus on my badminton training
7143478 i am just a sportsman i hope the people understand this although the datukship is an added pressure on me i would certainly use it to work harder knowing that there is a lot of expectation of me
7143479 it does not mean that it is a complete rejection of the young candidates it is just that the expectations were too high on them in the first place
7143480 they are popular in the media but not well known among the grassroots members outside of the klang valley or the urban areas
7143481 girls start having crushes on adults like a teacher or a parents friend for boys this is the time when they have stronger sexual impulses and fantasies
7143482 their risky behaviour is caused by the lack of sexual and reproductive health information
7143483 they are not taught the necessary skills in negotiating sexual relationships and how to deal with peer pressure
7143484 although a family health education programme is endorsed by the education ministry teachers are seldom equipped and are uncomfortable in teaching the subject
7143485 youth sexuality is still a sensitive subject not just in asian countries but in all cultures
7143486 programmes that offer sexual and reproductive health services to youths can expect to encounter some resistance from the community
7143487 sex education is not training for promiscuity it aims to increase the individuals responsibility in a normal healthy sexual relationship
7143488 in countries which have sex education the youths tend to delay their initiation into sex when they actually have sex more of them took the necessary precautions
7143489 one third of those who dont use any form of contraceptive say they didnt expect to have sex and another third say that sex wasnt as much fun with it or that they find it difficult to use
7143490 it could also be because they are scared their families would find out
7143491 both young women and men need sexual education they need to be taught issues relating to sexuality such as contraception healthy and responsible relationship marriage
7143492 there were pictures of him cajoling and inciting the crowd he had been reported as saying that i have negotiated with the dang wangi police to stop the forum at 9am or else we will act
7143493 his repugnant behaviour while still serving as wakil rakyat is the issue
7143494 frankly we still have not had the chance to employ any of these wet trade cidb workers because we dont know where they are
7143495 they couldnt take it they just upped and left after a week or two because they couldnt stand working under the hot sun
7143496 cidb trained them to be trainers they are not aware of what is going on in the industry the problems that would be faced by the trainees and what the job site sequence is like its true the workers trained by cidb are not that good
7143497 they dont see a chance to progress to higher skill levels to have a career path unlike in countries like australia where the workers can pursue their training up to diploma and degree level if theyre good
7143498 if everyone complains theres clearly something wrong the emphasis should be on practical training dont shelter them let them feel what its like on site
7143499 maybe its true the training is not up to industry expectations
7143500 we are working towards upgrading the training syllabi were also looking into the possibility of twinning up with some institutions of higher learning in australia
7143501 its hard for us to get students to enrol in the wet trades because of the 3 d factor dirty difficult and dangerous for value added trades like electrical work landscaping and scaffolding we can get many students
7143502 so if you dont have the students you cant expect to replace the foreign workers with locals
7143503 once they local students graduate its not easy for them to join the bigger companies
7143504 these companies usually have a large foreign worker base and our workers dont feel comfortable living in the kongsi with them
7143505 ibs is taking the problem from a job site environment to a factory environment
7143506 pre cast means instead of going to the job site to cast im going to the factory to do the casting and then putting them together at the job site
7143507 so how can you do pre cast without the wet trade workers what is the cidb talking about
7143508 they can say anything they want but the industry dictates what it needs
7143509 these young boys from the training school think theyre great and demand high salaries but they know nuts
7143510 why force those whore not interested why not focus more on upgrading the skills of workers in the industry
7143511 their current remand order will end on wednesday so we will have to see whether they are to be charged in malacca by then
7143512 besides the gunman there were a few other masked men in the getaway car a maroon honda civic
7143513 the show is proven to be the best platform for product manufacturers to directly meet with their customers
7143514 generally both exhibitors and visitors are satisfied with this years show saying that it is more organised
7143515 my men have done their best in the investigation and i have no complaints i am a bit disappointed by the suits but i will take them in stride
7143516 this is part and parcel of the job and my men and i will not dwell on this matter
7143517 he has the right to file the civil suits but they will not discourage my men from carrying out their duties and responsibilities
7143518 once the dna profiling act is passed by parliament it will give a new dimension to the case
7143519 sometimes when a robbery occurs at a goldsmith and police review the closed circuit television camera recordings to identify the suspects the image is unclear or blurry
7143520 there were instances where there were no images at all
7143521 every criminal is a member of a family so its important that we start with the family when we fight crime
7143522 although we dont have much time we will make sure that hardcore poverty does not exist by 2010
7143523 we will try our best even though time is short
7143524 it is the nations responsibility to help the poor and the lower income group because poverty in any form can be a threat to society
7143525 we still give jobs to immigrants even illegals because they are easier to exploit
7143526 although we always hear people say that locals are too choosy when it comes to employment those are just excuses from employers
7143527 i have heard complaints from foreign investors and businessmen and they are afraid of the crimes reported in the newspapers
7143528 i heard there are plenty of projects opening up in penang and johor
7143529 ive gone to ikbn institut kemahiran belia negara for training and i know the goings on in the industry
7143530 when i was working i mostly supervised and didnt do the work at the site myself
7143531 so im learning to do them now and also the theory part as well like what ratio is the best for the cement mixture safety precautions to take and some other stuff that i knew but was not an expert
7143532 they had a good warm up today yesterday on the short oil surface
7143533 i knew all along it will be tough for them to achieve anything in the doubles
7143534 my charges are peaking towards the team event and as for now they are heading the right direction
7143535 i hope for the best from them in tomorrows today trios
7143536 i think its great to get the silver and i won it in a fair way
7143537 but its not my place to judge her i just wanted to get on the medal stand i didnt know where it would be im very happy with the silver
7143538 its great because this is the first ever olympic medal for mauritius in any sport
7143539 we came here with just two boxers and its a great achievement for such a small country like mauritius in the middle of the indian ocean
7143540 i thought he might win because it was so close
7143541 i thought that in a fair round some points would not have been scored but this is sport one must lose one must win
7143542 i am sick and tired of our name being dragged through the mud like this
7143543 yesterday friday my ioc colleagues were continually making reference to what they called another scandal for ireland
7143544 to me it is very intimidating to do it this way
7143545 it could easily be construed they are trying to get no answers at all it certainly doesnt make me very comfortable the truth is being ascertained
7143546 well ask them about the checks that were conducted and whether or not they asked for them approved of them things of that nature
7143547 to me it would be a lot less invasive and create a lot less anxiety if they received a written response first
7143548 this just raises more questions about the processes and procedures
7143549 that is what makes them a big team their heart you dont want to let them grow in confidence
7143550 they will come out better than they did in our preliminary match they are good at executing and are dangerous we have a job to finish
7143551 we gave away the first quarter and we paid a very expensive price for that
7143552 after that it was an uphill battle especially after manu ginobilis injury we didnt do what we planned and you cannot afford that against a team like the usa
7143553 the man is embarrassed about the indignity brought on the club and on the league he never intended for this to be the case
7143554 he has said to me if you need me to resign as a director to serve the needs of the premier league im fine with that as long as it doesnt change anything else
7143555 were talking about a lot of things weve talked about restructuring the board and selling part of his stake to an equity partner who could come in and take some of the pressure away
7143556 two speed boats chased and opened fire at the cargo ship a suspected mother ship was in the vicinity but the japanese cargo ship managed to escape after the captain increased speed and took evasive manoeuvres
7143557 we still have to work together so confrontation would make it awkward to deal with each other later
7143558 youre too old to be attempting something new what if it doesnt work out
7143559 you are never too old to learn anything new and you wont die if it doesnt work out
7143560 oh oh you may not be good enough maybe you should never have done this
7143561 postponement would only be granted in cases of death or near death
7143562 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
7143563 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
7143564 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
7143565 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
7143566 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
7143567 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
7143568 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
7143569 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
7143570 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
7143571 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
7143572 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
7143573 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently
7143574 when you play as a striker it is always like this
7143575 when you stop playing it is difficult to come back and play again you need rhythm even more when you are a striker because you need confidence if you dont have confidence you are nothing
7143576 i dont think i am back to my best yet i am still looking to enjoy my football but i am starting to like it again because i am playing more games and the more i play the more i learn how chelsea play and i think the more i play the more confidence i will have
7143577 scolari has an unbelievable record in the world game and he has the resources available which are the envy of us all im sure hell do very well there
7143578 you cant write chelsea off when it comes to the title it was so close last season it went right down to the wire
7143579 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini and shamala revisited
7143580 muslims must act based on the quran and sunnah we must behave well muslims must not be rude i am ashamed of your behaviour islam does not condone this
7143581 conflict of civil and syariah laws after subashini and shamala
7143582 i dont know what our government does period i reality is my drug
7143583 man muss olympiasieger werden damit sich die leute in 20 jahren noch an einen erinnern

7143585 the usage of existing water tanks and internal piping system which are made of zinc or iron always affect the quality of treated water from syarikat bekalan air selangor syabas
7143586 treated water from syabas complies with health ministrys standards before it is channelled to individual meters but it changes colour or contains rust once it enters the internal piping system or the water tanks in houses
7143587 the management must also clean water tanks in buildings under their care at least once in six months
7143588 elizabeth represents the element of youth in the malaysian team this is also in recognition of the contribution of women to malaysian sports
7143589 2008 is over lets look to 2012 and it is athletes like elizabeth and pandelela rinong who is only 15 who will carry on in london
7143590 the selection of an athlete from sarawak is also good for national integration
7143591 i couldnt concentrate as the pressure of winning a medal was just too much
7143592 i am so disappointed especially after getting a second chance for a medal but i just couldnt focus
7143593 it was a dream game all i could think of was thank god the ball went over the line and now thanks to that i have a gold medal
7143594 we didnt play our best football today yesterday but this victory is a good one for us
7143595 the fact that we have been to the athletes village and met famous sportsmen its all an experience that we will not forget quickly
7143596 messi terrorises not only our team but all teams in europe he didnt score but he created a lot of their chances
7143597 that is why we have the silver and they have the gold
7143598 were very disappointed but it means we came second in the olympic games
7143599 we had a lot of good scoring chances but you have to score goals to win the gold medal
7143600 i came here as the underdog because of the times i ran so far this year
7143601 its been a good night for kenya we have done something good here for our country
7143602 i knew she maryam would be very strong and i had to work hard to win
7143603 the real power of money is to give away in charity
7143604 we spent all day yesterday watching videos of boonjomnong because we knew that there has to be an effective strategy to fight him nobody else could find the right stratgey but i guess we did
7143605 this is so important for me but also for my country i dont have a coach i have a magician
7143606 all my life ive been waiting for today i went through so much hurt so much
7143607 thats disrespect i dont know where theyre going with that
7143608 there is an adage that the best sermons are not preached they are lived if you look at the life of senator mccain you see a life of courage of dedication of duty of honor of character of strength of patriotism in a measure that is epic
7143609 on the question of iraq john mccain has had the guts to stand out on his own arguing for what he thought was right and it turned out that he was right about the surge working to improve conditions in iraq
7143610 unfavorable developments militarily on the battlefront in iraq and politically at home
7143611 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7143612 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games
7143613 the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7143614 he got injured in the bout to me it was obvious he was unable to continue his toe on his left foot was broken
7143615 theyre blatantly robbing me of going into the semi finals
7143616 theres one thing i hate about this sport is that the judges can control peoples lives and can take points away and they can do whatever they want
7143617 i mean i always thought about getting one but i imagined your clothes would dry all crunchy sort of
7143618 fewer than half of the 16 200 major league baseball players have ever hit a home run
7143619 i think it just matters what youre planning on doing with everything and how youre doing to do it
7143620 we feel its really important to get kids involved early
7143621 teens today want their voices heard they really care about whats going on in the environment the war in iraq the economy theyre opinionated and want their voice heard and this is a way to do that
7143622 a lot of kids are like it doesnt matter what we think so a lot of kids dont have opinions
7143623 but this lets you know yeah you do matter so its really cool i do like it
7143624 the plane managed to takeoff then it started to sway from side to side until it fell

7143633 the overall employment figures are still very robust we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7143634 its important to note that bad news always sells well in the media
7143635 when companies are actually adding staff when employments increasing in particular firms you never see that or rarely see that in the media
7143636 that creates a very unbalanced picture of whats actually happening
7143637 sesungguhnya kami telah menurunkannya al quran pada malam kemuliaan dan tahukah kamu apakah malam kemuliaan itu malam kemuliaan itu lebih baik dari seribu bulan pada malam itu turun malaikat malaikat dan malaikat jbril dengan izin tuhannya untuk mengatur segala urusan malam itu penuh kesejahteraan sampai terbit fajar
7143638 beberapa hari yang ditentukan itu ialah bulan ramadhan bulan yang di dalamnya diturunkan permulaan al quran sebagai petunjuk bagi manusia dan penjelasan penjelasan mengenai petunjuk itu dan pembeda antara yang hak dan yang batil karena itu barangsiapa di antara kamu hadir di negeri tempat tinggalnya di bulan itu maka hendaklah la berpuasa pada bulan itu dan barangsiapa sakit atau dalam perjalanan lalu ia berbuka maka wajiblah baginya berpuasa sebanyak hari yang ditinggalkannya itu pada harihari yang lain allah menghendaki kemudahan bagimu dan tidak menghendaki kesukaran bagimu dan hendaklah kamu mencukupkan bilangannya dan hendaklah kamu mengagungkan allah atas petunjuk nya yang diberikan kepadamu supaya kamu bersyukur
7143639 hai orang yang berselimut muhammad bangunlah untuk sembahyang di malam hari kecuali sedikit daripadanya yaitu seperduanya atau kurangilah dari seperdua itu sedikit atau lebih dari seperdua itu dan bacalah al quran itu dengan perlahan lahan sesungguhnya kami akan menurunkan kepadamu perkataan yang berat
7143640 yang telah menciptakan kamu lalu menyempurnakan kejadianmu dan menjadikan susunan tubuh mu seimbang
7143641 yang telah menciptakan tujuh langit berlapis lapis kamu sekali kali tidak melihat pada ciptaan tuhan yang maha pemurah sesuatu yang tidak saimbang maka lihatlah berulang ulang adakah kamu lihat sesuatu yang tidak seimbang

7143649 estos chicos necesitan mucha rutina la agenda es muy repetitiva porque ellos llevan los cambios muy mal
7143650 si est s motivado y te gusta cualquier dificultad es f cil de sobrellevar esta es una labor que te llena de satisfacci n
7143651 es un respiro familiar para que los padres tengan la oportunidad de desconectar un poco del cuidado de estos chicos
7143652 los monitores son una ayuda permanente para los ni os les acompa an en todas las actividades de la agenda y procuran que est n lo mejor posible
7143653 being on the horse has helped her gain better posture
7143654 shes learning the movements of what its like to walk and so shes beginning to take little steps and shes become more vocal
7143655 a horse moves three dimensionally up and down and side to side and youre moving through space
7143656 and that tends to generate or activate all of your muscles in your body once those are activated then that sort of starts a chain reaction where alertness increases your respiratory system is engaged your diaphragm and so kids have more respiratory ability to get speech out
7143657 not that she needs it but i think its boosted her self esteem and just to meet different people with the same abilities that she has

7143669 las empresas van a poder hacer su descargo pero que ello no impide que se las intime como se hizo como primera medida y luego que se las sancione
7143670 uno de los art culos de la ordenanza est referido espec ficamente a las sanciones donde se establecen multas econ micas que van de 100 a 30 000 veces la tarifa b sica
7143671 las empresas no pueden decidir qu cobrar o qu no cobrar si hay una legislaci n de base que lo determina
7143672 hasta ahora se repartieron cerca de 840 credenciales pero faltan algo as como 400
7143673 ahora los empresarios deber n hacer su descargo puesto que la intimaci n est en curso y empezar a cobrar el boleto universitario como lo establece la ordenanza vigente

7143722 i think it was a pretty good vote where everyone agreed that this solution is not the best for everybody
7143723 but it is something that can be worked out for the majority and thats what we were trying to get
7143724 what weve reached is a suggested solution that were going to present to the board and none of it is written in stone
7143725 theyre merely suggestions after 13 months of a lot of work on the part of many community members
7143726 its quite shocking to hear from employees that this sort of behaviour continues to happen she says
7143727 organisations need to realise that bullying and unfair treatment of staff is occurring and could be impacting on their own workplace culture or worse still exposing them to the risk of liability possible fines and even brand damage
7143728 they can be prosecuted for an incident that happens between other staff members as well as for not providing employees with adequate equal employment opportunity and occupational health and safety information and training she says
7143729 managing the risks is about empowering your people to fully understand their rights and responsibilities at work and to feel like they can speak up on inappropriate behaviour without experiencing recrimination as a result evans says
7143730 weve put processes and education in place so people understand the boundaries kyriakou says

7143738 american dream under 8 years of bush and mccain is slipping away
7143739 we dont have to have 4 more years of president bush and john mccain
7143740 this may be our last chance to claim the america we love to restore americas soul

7143743 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7143744 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7143745 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7143746 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7143747 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7143748 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7143749 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7143750 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7143751 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7143752 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7143753 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7143754 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7143755 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7143756 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7143757 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7143758 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7143759 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7143760 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7143761 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7143762 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7143763 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7143764 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7143765 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7143766 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7143767 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7143768 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7143769 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7143770 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7143771 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7143772 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7143773 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7143774 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7143775 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7143776 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7143777 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7143778 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7143779 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7143780 this is a planning took where all things are going
7143781 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7143782 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7143783 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7143784 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7143785 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7143786 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7143787 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7143788 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7143789 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7143790 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7143791 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7143792 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7143793 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7143794 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7143795 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7143796 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7143797 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7143798 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7143799 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7143800 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7143801 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7143802 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7143803 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7143804 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7143805 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7143806 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7143807 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7143808 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7143809 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7143810 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7143811 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7143812 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7143813 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7143814 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7143815 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7143816 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7143817 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7143818 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7143819 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7143820 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7143821 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7143822 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7143823 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7143824 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7143825 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7143826 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7143827 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7143828 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7143829 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

7143873 but i think about the khmer rouge all the time its in my head its an obsession
7143874 only a single organization is chosen for the title each year it takes a tremendous amount of dedication and hard work on the part of students directors and parents to achieve this great accomplishment
7143875 the study of instrumental music positively impacts and integrates all of the core curriculums
7143876 in order to perform music appropriately the students learn mathematics in counting rhythms science of how the instrument is played music reading skills and music history an added bonus is the discipline inherent in practice and performance
7143877 i volunteer some of my day managing a small network and a ragtag band of computers for a local nonprofit i have been asked to set up a second open independent wireless network on site that will provide cost free broadband internet access to patrons the catch is that they want to provide access only to a select group of about 25 websites while disallowing everything else no objectionable sites no mundane but non relevant sites such as online banking or youtube and no other activities such as p2p or im they only want http and https activity from a set of whitelisted websites

7144062 shocked and saddened that its got this far in terms of the allegations and charges
7144063 there are two sides to a story and i guarantee that will come out in the end
7144064 the forest service in an attempt to bolster an outgoing presidents environmental legacy rammed through an environmental agenda that itself violates the countrys well established environmental laws
7144065 hes made some political accusations that does not play well with other judges he kind of threw some extra red paint on his decision in terms of making it vulnerable to reversal
7144066 when you have an opportunity to protect these roadless areas that are at risk you ought to take it
7144067 this is one of the most beautiful things ive ever seen in a videogame
7144068 if that does not work out we will be closing
7144069 don bosco is always looking for ways to better serve the community
7144070 newhouse has provided a really important service to our community
7144071 we are saddened to have to give up this fight that so many have fought for years before us to ensure that women and children the poorest of the poor had a safe place to live
7144072 ten is algo que decir necesito vuestro apoyo est is listos
7144073 well be in a strategic location to effectively and efficiently shape the culture being produced
7144074 it was exciting to see karis was already geared that way without losing the strength of the gospel story
7144075 honestly its a bit unusual to have a group that approaches us with an idea
7144076 this is a good example of how citizens can solve problems in their own community
7144077 the success of this building and what it means to the community as columbias living room is that it serves multiple purposes
7144078 now we can do even more because we have so much more space
7144079 we dont want people to come into this huge space and just be eaten up
7144080 the welfare of our church is tied to the welfare of our community
7144081 we see the adoption of the fla by kde as a positive and important milestone in the maturity of the free software community
7144082 the fla is a versatile document designed to work across different countries with different perceptions of copyright and authorship
7144083 as a truly international project kde provides a great example of how the fla can provide legal coherency in the mid to long term
7144084 the pressure is going to be how do we get this war right
7144085 in the case of iraq the americans had a big strategic rethink about how they were handling it
7144086 that kind of rethink is whats going to have to take place with afghanistan
7144087 were not in the blair kind of situation but it may come
7144088 and teach us about the good work we do in our state the importance of coming together as a community to celebrate with one another
7144089 were in the process of cutting 24 million out of our state budget but theres one area a couple of areas and one in particular where ive recommended that we not reduce our expenditures and thats the stipend for the agency of agriculture that helps provide some support for infrastructure and capital expenses at the fairs all around our state
7144090 theyre just so much nicer than the rest of the breeds theyre gentle even though theyre big
7144091 we have six horses on our farm and we have four of em over here and so well see if we can go back in and win some more ribbons
7144092 bill you need to rotate your shoulders more jason slow down your hands paul youre doing fantastic
7144093 eighteen million democratic primary voters donated money volunteered their time and energy worked very hard and then not only supported senator clinton but voted for her
7144094 all the efforts of supporters of legitimate citizens were for nothing because obama lied and cheated his way into a fraudulent candidacy and cheated legitimately eligible natural born citizens from competing in a fair process
7144095 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7144096 obamas grandmother on his fathers side half brother and half sister claim obama was born in kenya
7144097 reports reflect obamas mother went to kenya during her pregnancy however she was prevented from boarding a flight from kenya to hawaii at her late stage of pregnancy which apparently was a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight stanley ann dunham obama gave birth to obama in kenya after which she flew to hawaii and registered obamas birth
7144098 obamas mother failed to take the oath in order to regain her u s citizenship therefore obama would not have been able to regain his u s citizenship until he turned 18 years and after he took the oath of allegiance
7144099 since the oath of allegiance would have been entered in the records of the appropriate embassy legation consulate court or the attorney general if plaintiff is incorrect then obama should be able to produce in court a certified copy of the proceedings including a copy of the oath administered
7144100 obama traveled to pakistan using his indonesian passport at the time of travels to indonesia obama was 20 years old he was well aware he maintained his indonesia citizenship and failed to regain his united states citizenship even if obama maintained his united states citizenship which he failed to do he also carries citizenships in kenya and indonesia obama has divided loyalties with foreign countries thus obama carries multiple citizenships and is ineligible to run for president of the united states
7144101 if the dnc officers and or leaders had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship
7144102 the injunctive relief must be granted because failing to do so the dncs inaction defrauds everyone who voted in the democratic primary
7144103 ill keep you locked in my head until we meet again
7144104 ill keep you locked in my heart and my mind until we meet again
7144105 clothes were left on his bed under it and some clean washing was left in a pile on a chair books and magazines were scattered on the floor a cd was still in the stereo and bits of paper and fluff were in evidence on the carpet and along the window sill its a shambles
7144106 hes a lovely lad is tom all boys of his age are like that arent they mind you ive seen him through the window up there reading his olympic flame carbon print banned by gore plant life protests
7144107 you just remember one day youre going to have an accident and im going to be there then youll finally get whats coming to you
7144108 and just you remember you are on the dance team and should you miss when you plies and your footing should fail every one of your doting fans is going to devour you like a french pastry
7144109 you were and will be again i promise you that
7144110 never run unless it is for your life or unless you are on a special track designed for running
7144111 no but i know what youre thinking youre worried about being eaten again arent you
7144112 its a common insult when i was a child someone was always saying im going to eat you or im going to drink your blood or some such nonsense honestly darling as long as one is careful there is no reason to fear being eaten it is actually rather rare
7144113 your father was horribly burned there was nothing that could have been done you are 17 you should know by now that this is the way things work
7144114 you werent there mom you dont know how horrible it was
7144115 i know that your father was burned to the point in which he could not be helped
7144116 helped those men who came in their fire engine they were supposed to be there to help us they were supposed to save us not pull my dieing father off of me and eat him
7144117 youve been to counseling over this clara you know that these memories are alright to have
7144118 i know i know that the counselors say that i shouldnt be so horrified by this that lots of kids younger than me loose their parents to eating but i cant help it it terrifies me and that laurel
7144119 that laurel she knows that i was burned that night too someone must have told her that they almost ate me she doesnt care that the magistrate just happened to live nextdoor and he authorised them that i was not significantly injured enough to be eaten
7144120 sometimes i wish that i had let you eat people when you were young then maybe you wouldnt be so frightened of it now ive yet to meet a child who is as frightened at the prospect of being eaten as you are
7144121 he is off at the courthouse you know he has a descent number of people to judge today
7144122 i dont know why you garden at all your flowers are always so beautiful
7144123 of course they are we always get the best of the best marrow fertilizer from the rendering plant its one of the perks of being a magistrates wife after all
7144124 is my little silver medallist hungry youve got a big day tomorrow i want you well fed tonight
7144125 i fixed you some breakfast before your tournament today youre going to come home with the gold im sure of it
7144126 ill try my best mom but please dont get angry if i dont come home with a gold
7144127 if thats the best you can do you might as well just sit on the bench right now
7144128 im practicing for the javelin team i hear they may have a position opening up
7144129 i think this line is too far back the way to really throw accurately is to get closer this really is a stupid sport
7144130 she said simply quickening her pace towards me i gasped
7144131 what do you mean im not injured im not sick you cant eat me laurel
7144132 nobody will know that when they get here im going to say that you were so stupid you fell on your own javelin everyone will believe it since everyone already thinks youre an idiot i will tell them i had no choice but to eat you as i was the only one here and you were begging for me to kill you
7144133 why why do you have the right to kill me to eat me
7144134 because i deserve to finish what i started that bite mark on your shoulder it was mine
7144135 you must not remember that when i was 12 i lived down the street from you when your house caught fire my family and i went up to see what all the fuss was about we saw the firemen and they told us that the two victims were to be destroyed that they were too damaged to live my father and mother helped deal with your father but i noticed something else i saw a little girl sitting in a charred blanket covered in burns my mother turned to me and told me that you would be my first kill
7144136 so i came at you from the back and i bit down into your soft juicy shoulder but i was grabbed by the magistrate and pulled away before i could finish my job complete my god given right to rid the world of disease and weakness
7144137 and now im finally going to finish what i started
7144138 tell them that im fine i know that ill be alright just pull this thing pull it out of me
7144139 its not the will to win but the will to prepare to win that makes the difference

7144158 were looking at a number of possibilities for next years bledisloe cup denver is one of them but as i said were in the very early stages
7144159 it would be wrong to say were planning a test there that would be going too far but its fair to say were looking at it but before we make any decision we need to ascertain whether it is viable first it has to stack up there has to be a genuine reason for being there
7144160 my caddie and i have talked about that a little bit
7144161 and he says yeah i used to know this guy named happy streelman we used to call him hap because he was always happy and thats my dads father
7144162 weve run into different people and neat stories and situations like that so its kind of cool for them
7144163 my parents had always seen it on the schedule as the paramus event
7144164 and it didnt hit us until a week ago and the more they looked into it my uncle used to be a member here before he moved my grandparents are buried in washington cemetery and my cousin came and watched me last week and told me i was like well thats kind of cool
7144165 i wasnt planning on it being as meaningful of a week as probably as it came to but any week i can share with my parents and friends and as many friends that are in this area thats what its all about the win second place third place its great and all but the end of the day thats all we have is our families and friends and thats whats most important to me
7144166 im interested to see how i kind of react to it and thats what ive been working for my whole life this has been a culmination of many many hours and years of hard work and a lot of miles traveled around many tours around the whole country and even world
7144167 hopefully its just the beginning of many years of this but for many its kind of my first as of right now clubhouse lead going into sunday and if it goes well great and if not im going to try and learn much like i did the day with tiger woods and try to get better tomorrow evening than i am right now
7144168 that day with tiger was the greatest preparation i ever could have managed
7144169 i know it will be crazy tomorrow but i guarantee you it wont be quite as big as that day in san diego with tiger which was amazing
7144170 playing in these great major tournaments thats always been my dream
7144171 and now i get the chance to play in the u s open and the masters i think its going to be a great experience
7144172 everything i hit everything i putt just falls into the hole and its just amazing
7144173 branum said long has reached an agreement with prosecutors to plead guilty to desertion with intent to remain away permanently a lesser charge than desertion with intent to shirk hazardous duty
7144174 in exchange for him pleading guilty theyve agreed to lower the three year maximum sentence that usually comes with those charges
7144175 i think they want to prosecute him for free speech issues without actually charging him for them
7144176 members of pax christi the oxford catholic worker and fellowship of reconciliation will join voices in the wilderness
7144177 i feel that some of your polices are beginning to depart from deeply held traditional canadian values and you are transforming the face of canada with the mandate of a minority government you also have a majority in the house of commons who voted on behalf of canadians to support the request made by american war resisters to remain in canada i believe you are turning your back on a majority of canadians on an issue that is very important to us that is not the sign of a democratic prime minister somehow canada has always been a little bit different and we have always been proud of that we dont want to be more like anyone else sir in the name of decency compassion and a higher justice i request you to allow american war resisters to remain in canada as conscientious objectors please dont send them off to have their lives and families desroyed by an unjust war your decision to begin deporting american war resisters lacks decency and compassion i strongly urge you to reconsider your position

7144180 explores the human side of globalization exposing the many ways it uproots people in latin american and asia driving them to migrate at the same time u s immigration policy makes the labor of those displaced people a crime in the united states illegal people explains why our national policy produces even more displacement more migration more immigration raids and a more divided polarized society
7144181 at least level with your readers mr herbert tell them that you think the two major parties republican and democrat own all the voters and theres no one else on the ballot at least level with them
7144182 3 00 am you know what theyll say right dont do it at 3 00 am itll seem like a juvenile jab at hillary
7144183 all i have to say is that if it was deliberate and i really really doubt it was then that is the most substantive proof so far that dunkin donuts arrogance is getting the better of it the donut hole ploy on its own was kind of dumb but if it was a way to distract attention from the hole in the donut it was beyond self indulgent and the fact that the donut hole is not itself actually a hole is a sign the whole thing was too clever by half
7144184 a donut hole you know what theyll say right dont put a hole in the donut itll seem like a juvenile jab at the whole donut

7144194 this is as good a way to get a sense of whats in peoples minds as any experience
7144195 we believe if you want people to vote for you you have to go and ask them
7144196 your husband has about as much chance of winning as obama
7144197 i know you sat the last one out i want you phone banking man
7144198 id be for anybody who can beat norm coleman but i also like al
7144199 i think hed be great for us he reminds me of paul wellstone
7144200 couldnt stand the thought of losing that senate seat to norm coleman
7144201 my own personal experience is that his campaign is not resonating with minnesotans
7144202 if we had a quarter of a million id bet my lifes savings we could win this campaign i still think we can beat him
7144203 theres a high level of dissatisfaction with coleman and franken and im hearing that
7144204 i have a much higher iq than you do i suspect
7144205 if you get those individuals that fit the federal requirements it creates the american dream like no other program ive ever witnessed
7144206 whether it happens now or next year it will be a dream come true for these families
7144207 a house in galveston for this price would either be really old or rundown or have something wrong with it
7144208 being able to have a new house thats a decent size for us is really nice
7144209 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgement who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to make his point
7144210 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him he wont just make a good vice president he will make a great vice president with joe biden at my side i am confident we can take this country in a new direction
7144211 presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7144212 they need more than a tough soldier they need a wise leader
7144213 this story empowers the puma crowd because they see this and i do too as disrespecting senator clinton and breaking senator obamas words theyre still not behind obama
7144214 our best chance of winning the election is if he mr obama falls under a bus before wednesday then we can have hillary the polls show that we were right to support her
7144215 no one wants to talk about it but its the race thing anyone looking for a reason not to vote for a black man now has plenty of reasons
7144216 we deployed about 25 000 men to guard polling booths and the reports so far suggest that the voting went off without any major incident
7144217 the forest service in an attempt to bolster an outgoing presidents environmental legacy rammed through an environmental agenda that itself violates the countrys well established environmental laws
7144218 hes made some political accusations that does not play well with other judges he kind of threw some extra red paint on his decision in terms of making it vulnerable to reversal
7144219 when you have an opportunity to protect these roadless areas that are at risk you ought to take it
7144220 hey yuki none too good im afraid he just found out that someone was vandalizing the schools sign yet again
7144221 crap i was hoping he wouldnt figure that one out till tomorrow
7144222 i accidentally fell asleep in mrs das class she asked me to tell her what my dream was about and i did just that
7144223 well lets see it started with mrs da walking down this pretty meadow with a teacher of the year award she stopped to tie her shoe when out of the blue these two huge lions came tearing at her claws and fangs ready they jumped her and started to tear her to shreds but before the larger of the two could deliver the final blow she fell down a cliff into a pit full of man eating great white sharks the largest one took her right arm and started to shake its head back and forth suddenly the arm was cut right off blood stained the water the current churned the water crimson red and just as they were about to kill her this giant chicken swooped down and plucked her out of the water she woke me up right then thats the whole reason for my outburst
7144224 oh yuki you really need to get that imagination of yours under control
7144225 i would really appreciate it if you would use my last name im your principal not your friend
7144226 oh my god the light i can see the light its getting closer mr roper the light make it go away
7144227 well i would but my brother and sister think im not that funny just sarcastic
7144228 well im sure that you dont want to hear the whole story so ill give you the short story
7144229 very good yuki its nice to know that you are learning something so what is it this time
7144230 well to put things in small vision yuki falls asleep teacher wakes her up via ruler yuki makes lame outburst gets in trouble then yuki makes another smart remake has to tell what her dream was all about tries to explain but the teacher cuts her off and sends her out the door yuki turns around and makes another remark before chair nearly flattens her like road kill happy
7144231 very funny so this dream of yours you were plotting ways that mrs da could be killed am i correct
7144232 because you have done just that before and i wouldnt put it past you
7144233 touch yea i was but you havent had to sit through one of her boring lectures before
7144234 oh contraire i have what did you think we do at teachers meetings
7144235 i actually thought that you threw a huge party served alcoholic beverages and made fun of the students namely me
7144236 no we dont make fun of the students at least not all the time
7144237 ill tell you in a minute but first i want to know what you did to the sign
7144238 you know what happened yuki it used to say we would like to congratulate mr roper for his excellent work at his job here tonight at 7 00 see you there parents of students get a discount on food drinks and pictures of this momentous occasion so im going to ask again what did you do to the sign
7144239 not buying it yuki youre the only one at this school that refers to me as mr groper what did you do to the sign
7144240 hey yuki none too good im afraid he just found out that someone was vandalizing the schools sign yet again
7144241 hey yuki none too good im afraid he just found out that someone was vandalizing the schools sign yet again
7144242 the discretion of a man makes him slow to anger and his glory is to overlook a transgression
7144243 he who is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city
7144244 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7144245 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo
7144246 i always said hey you think i am doing good you should see my little brother
7144247 you can see it coming and i am glad hes transitioned well into his new team
7144248 the next thing i am waiting for is for him to remember who helped him get to this point and give some of that information my way
7144249 one day i might call it a race car but i keep calling it a cot because we just havent quite turned the corner literally with this new car and trying to get it to handle better
7144250 its not the normal championship type effort but you are going to have your good years and your bad years and you have to balance them all out
7144251 the mind set for me at bristol has always been to protect the race car and get toward the end and then you really start to race these guys
7144252 sometimes you sneak up on them and dont press the go pedal until its 200 laps to go
7144253 once everyone admitted it to themselves that we needed to try a bit harder that was the first step
7144254 theres a lot going on behind the scenes right now
7144255 hes done it to us several times you cant stress enough that the hero stuff sometimes works in the world but it doesnt work here
7144256 hardens been great when hes on hes very very good
7144257 we knew if we could add him to a rotation of carlos zambrano ryan dempster and ted lilly it would really help us the trade rounded off our 12 man pitching staff very well
7144258 gave positive input on how he could be used and weve followed that
7144259 billys building an outstanding system for the future no one likes to go through what oakland is going through now but in the long run billys got a lot of positives we were preferring that gallagher would be in our rotation next year
7144260 and he came in the next day and said he felt fine
7144261 i think if a play breaks down i have the ability to make a play with my feet
7144262 when i say playmaking its not like im going to go out of my way to scramble around and try to make plays but if something happens i going to make something happen
7144263 our guys want to win and thats what its about
7144264 they would be behind whoever was going to be the quarterback and theyre giving me support thats one more thing to keep working for winning for every teammate
7144265 i really think candace and sylvia those are the babies
7144266 sylvia did the running hook tonight that i showed her about five days ago for me its about passing the torch its a clich but thats the way it is
7144267 i thought i was retired after 96 olympics gold in atlanta
7144268 they all told me stories about how when they were little they watched me and wanted to be like me and came to my camp and got my autograph
7144269 this team stands out from her other three olympic squads in my heart and mind
7144270 weve only been together one month and ive never seen a team become so selfless in such a short period of time before we got together i thought i hope theyre not about themselves how many points they score i couldnt have been more wrong
7144271 i love you but im not in love with you
7144272 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club the premier league he never intended this dr thaksin has been really open about this
7144273 he has said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing
7144274 he wants to be at this ground on sunday but he is hearing advice about being in a public space he wants to be at this ground eastlands on sunday but people may want to come and show their support from his country and he doesnt want to use this as a political platform and there has been a threat to his safety worldwide
7144275 the man is embarrassed about the indignity brought on the club and the premier league

7144277 playing in these great major tournaments thats always been my dream
7144278 and now i get the chance to play in the u s open and the masters i think its going to be a great experience
7144279 you do not need to obsess over the size of your ass if you are the sort of woman who is attracted to men who are not bothered by the size of your ass
7144280 why do so many nice women end up with assholes
7144281 do you think hed have married me if i didnt look like this
7144282 ill be honest with you i really like you damozel and if i lived nearer to you id probably see you but i just cant handle a two hour drive on the weekends
7144283 thats why you need to be a good girl and be nice to everyone
7144284 you need to straighten up right now and behave yourself
7144285 or well end the party and send everyone home if youre too tired to behave youre too tired to have a party
7144286 were going to all this trouble and expense for you the least you can do is behave as if you appreciate it
7144287 if someone offers me money im not going to turn it down
7144288 the people you invited to be present because they care enough about you to bother care about or will notice details
7144289 oh it didnt go off perfectly i know but at a moment like this who cares
7144290 you get to have whatever you want the whole time
7144291 people are taking a lot of trouble for you so put your best foot forward
7144292 how could you not know that i didnt want this
7144293 easy to read sensitive meter that displays microphone response and indicates battery status

7144295 but thats exactly what i mean he has so much more at stake than i do he puts it at risk every time he sees me he risks much more to be with me than i do to be with him thats how i know he loves me
7144296 i am a beautiful and worthy person fully deserving of love
7144297 the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results
7144298 why isnt it supposed to be the happiest day of my life whys it just the bride who gets to have the whole day to herself and make everyone do everything she wants them to i hate it i thought it would be fun but instead of a big party its like some sort of broadway production its like she and her mom think if they dont get every single nuance exactly right theyll end up with bad reviews and its costing her parents
7144299 for all this crap can you believe that can you believe people would spend that much money on a party for a wedding its not like its that unusual or special to get married practically everyone does it
7144300 id do anything if i could get out of it
7144301 man i thought i loved selena i was sure i did i was scared when we finally made the decision but i went along with what she wanted bought her the ring she wanted and so on and then i thought it would just be a matter of doing the same thing everyone else does go to church dress up and then a big party afterward with all our friends but it isnt like that i couldnt ask a lot of people in my family because her parents want to have a big sit down dinner afterward and there wasnt room in the country club banquet hall i asked if we could move it to a local hotel where there was plenty of room and just have finger food and cake like the weddings weve had in my family and they went ballistic that would have been tacky and the place was ugly and it would look cheap as if it doesnt look tacky and ugly and cheap for us to leave out family members so we can have a sit down meal and all the crap over her dress and her shoes and the flowers doesnt she know i dont care seriously i cant tell one white dress from another i hate this i hate it but its too late to get out of it right
7144302 i came to you because youre the expert in relationships
7144303 you know in finding them youve been so lucky that way how do you do it seriously i need to know
7144304 all of the ones our age seem to want younger women youd think that by the time they reach a certain age the demands of seeing to a 28 year old would start to seem daunting to them but theyre all scared that life is passing them by and they all want a second chance i cant compete i was an idiot to think i could i might as well have that sandwich theres no use starving myself excuse me miss id like to order something else
7144305 but you know danny isnt the kind of person i could actually be with hes really kind of clingy and he graduated from small nonprestigious college hes younger than me and shorter i really enjoy his company but
7144306 it was and though he makes much less money than she does hes financially responsible

7144344 i played solid on the front nine i hit a lot of good iron shots and made some good putts
7144345 i was playing good and we had a four group wait on 14 which really took me out of my rhythm right there i kind of righted the ship the next few holes i kept hitting good shots i just didnt get anything out of them

7144350 this golf course is a little sneaky it doesnt take a whole lot to make a bogey
7144351 i made one really bad swing but apart from that it wasnt crazy off the wall on the back nine it was just a couple of loose shots off a hair and all of a sudden i was 3 over
7144352 just let it ride i have enjoyed it but this game is very very fickle so i want to enjoy it while i can its been a nice stretch and thats why ive kept playing i was going to take a week off but i figured i was playing well so i may as well keep going

7144404 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs

7144410 its a signal but we dont know what it means

7144412 it could go back for miles and miles and theres no real mechanism to stop it
7144413 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans it also matters that his track record on foreign policy will be invaluable to the new administration in helping to secure our nations place in the world
7144414 this is a terrific choice joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset he will be a tireless and enthusiastic partner for senator obama in the campaign and in the white house
7144415 the choice of my good friend senator joe biden as barack obamas vice presidential running mate is great news for michigan senator biden is a strong fighter for the auto industry and american manufacturing jobs he played an instrumental role in helping chrysler in the 1980s and in his strong support for our efforts to keep auto jobs in america today
7144416 joe biden said it best and its something we agree with that barack obama is not ready to be president i think that he will help make our case
7144417 i agree with joe biden when he said he did not think barack obama was ready to be president and that the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training i also do not believe that the addition of an east coast liberal senator to provide on the job training to obama on foreign affairs will do anything to help michigan tackle the difficult economic challenges we face
7144418 presidential candidate barack obama picks a running mate ready for the job sen joe biden of delaware not only is a man with working class roots but he has an extensive record of working in washington senator biden brings vital foreign policy experience this is a man who knows how to get the job done it is well known that he has an impressive record of collaborating across party lines this is definitely a good choice for the democratic party
7144419 i got a lot i cant complain everything i got it is just that after that gold i was not able to give my country another medal because of wrist injury or i would have got even more but i got enough

7144521 christian groups who flouted a chinese ban on foreign missionaries are calling their underground evangelizing during the olympic games a success
7144522 we did see some conversions said christian missionary mark taylor of pensacola fla
7144523 the christians came in on tourist visas and said they were involved in sports or cultural activities
7144524 one christian group made headlines this week when chinese authorities confiscated 315 chinese language bibles found in their checked luggage when they arrived in the southwestern city of kunming from thailand
7144525 it was almost like they were treating us like criminals
7144526 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
7144527 even the rev franklin graham son of the evangelist billy graham said during a visit to china this year that he did not support illegal missionary work during the olympics

7144534 these people grew up with the internet its always on its always with them and they use it to share information about what theyre doing and what theyre thinking
7144535 as a result the way they make decisions is to find out what their peers think and reach a consensus theyre not into expert wisdom and people with long resumes theyre much more likely to respond to messages in social networks like than to traditional campaign messages

7144555 i think we should include dick and jane in the meeting i gave it a lot of thought and both of them bring a unique cultural perspective to the table

7144560 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7144561 do you think it wil be more difficult now sen mccain to criticize barack obamas foreign policy credentials when someone like joe biden is on the ticket a very experienced and respected voice on capitol hill in these matters
7144562 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries mccain said

7144587 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7144588 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7144589 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7144590 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7144591 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7144592 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7144593 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7144594 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7144595 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7144596 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

7144632 this translates to 93 sex offenders and 12 serial sexual offenders coming across u s borders illegally per day
7144633 this places the estimate for victimization numbers around 960 000 for the 88 months examined in this study
7144634 in those instances the illegal immigrants typically gained access to the victims after having worked as a day laborer at or near the victims homes
7144635 victims ranged in age from 1 year old to 13 years old with the average age being 6
7144636 the crime scenes were very bloody expressing intense angry perpetrator personalities
7144637 specifically most victims were blitzed rendered incapable of fighting back and then raped and murdered the most common method of killing was bludgeoning followed by stabbing

7144639 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colors but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
7144640 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
7144641 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
7144642 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
7144643 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
7144644 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
7144645 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
7144646 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production
7144647 why dont you just do that yourself and well maybe do something together later
7144648 well im really into really exciting so maybe i should just do it as

7144653 i think its always important and this time perhaps its more important
7144654 because of sen mccains age and health history it means succession is more of a concern than it might otherwise be
7144655 and then there is sen obamas newness to public life and the concerns some people have as to whether hes ready
7144656 my view is that obamas pick has become more important because of mccains attacks about whether hes ready to lead or not
7144657 with international problems swirling around even as iraq recedes hes got to get his bona fides on national security in order
7144658 sen biden doesnt believe that sen obama is ready to serve as president
7144659 sen biden has long been a leading critic of sen obamas lack of foreign policy experience hes criticized sen obama for his lack of leadership and judgment on iraq afghanistan and his commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of rogue states
7144660 the forest service in an attempt to bolster an outgoing presidents environmental legacy rammed through an environmental agenda that itself violates the countrys well established environmental laws

7144664 what is it with the australian media why are they focused on slandering second life as a failure i have recently discussed my research findings of commercial activity within second life with several journalists where only minimal quotes have been used out of their original context in order it seems to support an obvious negative bias
7144665 guys this stuff happens economies just cant grow all the time its not the end of the world and its probably not the end of facebook either
7144666 in terms of customers and perhaps your everyday people there was no evidence of anybody in there i was often the only one wandering around these very impressive sites on my own
7144667 one in four times you use second life the whole application will crash

7144672 some of our most popular destinations include pondi beach the billabong bar where many users frequently gather to talk and dance and also the popular australian icons including the harbour bridge and the sydney opera house
7144673 we also have a building sandbox where visitors can hone their virtual creative skills in a safe environment

7144688 from a political standpoint hes an asset and he would be a good president of the united states
7144689 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7144690 when change you can believe in turns out to be a 65 year old white guy
7144691 well just because youre older doesnt mean youre not for change
7144692 let me say this joe biden has been a fighter for change
7144693 the statement that sen clinton put out today which i saw when i got off the plane was a very very strong statement and i think her campaign was about experience his campaign is about experience but both of them would have been agents for change just because youre experienced doesnt mean youre stuck in the status quo of washington d c and any of you who have watched joe biden over the years know that he can be iconoclastic in terms of the status quo in terms of washington d c
7144694 joe biden has credentials in both areas as author of the crime bill as chair of the judiciary committee and as a leader a respected leader in the world as the chair of the foreign relations committee he brings strength to this ticket he also is someone who is from delaware but is born and raised in pennsylvania so brings political strength there catholic and a good relationship with the jewish community very respected there and so from a policy standpoint hell be great from a political standpoint hes an asset and he would be a good president of the united states
7144695 by the measure of the american people and the nominating process sen obama is ready to lead and now totally prepared to win and govern with this great team
7144696 i would have had that convention be about the iraq war not the vietnam war
7144697 john mccain is a great american hes served our country well hes a veteran to be respected but we have millions of other veterans who have needs and he has not been there for them on some of these votes in terms of their health care and their benefits in fact he didnt even show up for the gi bill vote
7144698 mark me down as one who says not being around a long time aint a bad thing the two best words in advertising they tell me are free and new obama is free and he is new and he will take our country in a new direction
7144699 i believe that women will see that they have the most to gain by the election of barack obama and the most to lose by the election of john mccain
7144700 i believe that many of these women will come back its hard to lose we all know that losing is hard youre for someone because you believe they would be the best and they may be the best but they did not win the election so you have to compare if they think that its ok to vote for john mccain then we havent been clear enough in communicating the message of whats at stake there and thats what our challenge is women as messengers are going to be very very strong for barack obama
7144701 wake up regret having consensual sex and then cry rape
7144702 during the 18th century britains population was larger than that of any other european state except for all the
7144703 it appears that most americans feel inferior or cheated unless they get the preferential treatment given to minority groups as soon as they are allowed to join a minority group they feel equal to everybody else
7144704 women cant stay pregnant all the time and men cant get pregnant at all
7144705 so the only option for those who are not handicapped or pregnant but want parking that is close to the front door is self injury followed by a trip to the doctor to get handicapped status
7144706 i felt it was the result of sheer desperation i knew tony was not an angry person he is a retreater and he doesnt like conflict i have no doubt that what tony told me at the time was the situation the only concern was what she could do to us and i think she had one aim and that was to see us not together
7144707 my father is a need to know person and that was when he needed to know
7144708 tony had really hurt kristin and he was not a nice person and former girlfriends had also been injured so beware
7144709 it was so we could all move on so we could secure our future we didnt want it to jeopardise our wedding we were very uncomfortable with it at the time we all had doubts in hindsight we should not have given in to her demands
7144710 guys were giving him the thumbs up and women were blowing him kisses
7144711 we are not trying to win the public over but it is nice to know that people who have a brain know there is a lot more to this than what they have heard
7144712 the one thing that has been good out of all of this is that tony and i have never been stronger we are so strong and even more in love i just need to remind him sometimes that he is a good person
7144713 he mr sheppard said he wanted to compose a piece which completely summed up britain and our island mentality
7144714 he liked the mantra like way that the words and locations flowed i recorded them over the soundtrack whilst listening to the music in my headphones
7144715 a lot of people dont understand the forecast but to them it sounds like a piece of poetry
7144716 i think its comforting to people who dont understand the forecast who are lying in bed imagining these boats being tossed around in the sea and snuggle down feeling glad to be in bed
7144717 other officers had been in the room before this officer and they had no idea anybody was in there

7144780 to be able to even put a fingerprint upon that legacy what more could an adventure writer want i was only paid a fraction of what i get for one of my regular novels but i could not pass up this chance if they asked me to i wouldve written this in my own blood
7144781 i went after it for obvious reasons i didnt want a perdition novel written by someone else out there i proceeded to write the best novelization of my career staying faithful to david selfs script which was already fairly faithful to my graphic novel but fleshed out the script with characterization expanded dialogue scenes and just generally turning it into a quality novel of around 100 000 words after i submitted it and had the new york editor say it was the best tie in novel hed ever read the licensing person at dreamworks required me to cut everything in the novel that wasnt in the script that i was the creator of the property held no sway i was made to butcher the book down to 40 000 words

7144790 i must hasten to add says smil that underground co2 sequestration in the service of secondary oil recovery is most desirable as is any form of plant bound sequestration ranging from a gradual build up of soil organic matter to massive planting of trees
7144791 a key comparison illustrates the daunting scale of the challenge
7144792 the obvious question is why it should be even attempted given the fact that a 10 reduction in co2 emissions could be achieved by several more rational mature and readily available adjustments
7144793 the last perfect example was the demise of the soviet empire between 1989 and 1997 the primary energy use in the successor states of the ussr fell by a third then consider the current u s trajectory of enormous accumulated budget and trade deficits more than twice as large unfunded health and social security liabilities absence of any new domestic savings gutting of the countrys manufacturing dismal state of its education acute strategic overstretch and a crippling dependence on energy imports as of 2005 even its net food imports and you do not need a great deal of imagination to construct scenarios of a major economic choose one crisis pull back collapse to be accompanied by significantly reduced energy consumption
7144794 our quest for ever higher energy use thus has no objective or subjective justification
7144795 the national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities
7144796 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to 10 times the national average
7144797 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas
7144798 to our enormous surprise the free radicals survive hours days even indefinitely
7144799 its early in the game and theres a lot of ways of doing these calculations
7144800 you could be destroying some pollutants and creating some at the same time
7144801 for the period we examined 1987 to 2004 there was a clear relationship between warm el nino events and increased occurrence of heavy precipitation
7144802 events will certainly become more frequent in a warmer climate
7144803 it is very likely that heavy rainfall will become more common and more intense in a warming world
7144804 it is too early to say by how much real world changes in rainfall will surpass projections from the climate models
7144805 no one can control what happens when genetic material from different species is mixed like putting a gene from say a fish into a plant
7144806 millions of small farmers all over the world face being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
7144807 the genetically engineered crops now being grown represent a massive uncontrolled experiment whose outcome is inherently unpredictable the results could be catastrophic
7144808 we should not be afraid to face the death of the old future nor should we be afraid to try to earn a new one
7144809 our brains are big enough to see into the future and plot long term consequences
7144810 well we like the train and arguing that we should get off is not realistic
7144811 the old futures dead and gone never to return theres a new way through the hills ahead this one well have to earn this one well have to earn

7144816 it happened a long time ago five years to be exact but its sort of haunted me ever since the smiling bright top part of it and the hidden gruesomeness underneath

7144818 yeah and have you ever noticed where its beautiful theres a lot of pretty but not a lot of jobs unless you worked for the university

7144829 ive always played my cricket my own way and thats certainly the way i want to lead the team
7144830 i think i can do that along with the help and advice of those whove come before me
7144831 i plan to be a captain who leads in the same style that i play i feel that im an attacking and positive sort of player i love the challenge of a hard fought game of cricket i like being the one who is responsible for making the right or wrong decision
7144832 there are strengths in each of the captains ive played under
7144833 ive had waugh ponting warne a lot of good captains even at grade level but the key thing ive learnt from a number of them has been to always be your own person
7144834 you need to back yourself 100 and always believe in yourself you need to back your instinct if you feel like you want to make a change or something you have to back your own judgment and ability thats certainly one of punters strengths and its a strength of pretty much all the captains ive played under
7144835 the last thing i want to do is be like someone else
7144836 metacritic score below 65 interesting choice of metric btw may not be bad games they might just be niche games and theres plenty of money to make in the niche

7144844 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7144845 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7144846 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7144847 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7144848 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7144849 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7144857 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7144858 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7144859 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7144860 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7144861 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7144862 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7144863 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7144864 estamos sob influ ncia de uma frente fria vindo do sul do continente isso um tempo t pico de inverno a circula o mar tima faz o tempo mudar mais no litoral e no oceano
7144865 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7144866 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7144867 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7144868 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7144869 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7144870 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7144871 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7144872 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7144873 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7144874 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

7144877 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7144878 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7144879 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7144880 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7144881 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7144882 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7144883 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7144884 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7144885 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7144886 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7144887 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7144888 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7144889 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7144890 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7144891 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7144892 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa

7144899 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

7144908 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

7144979 well actually i was happy you were here because now i could get out of this heat
7144980 this aint nothing compared to the swamp one might say its kinda chilly out here today
7144981 but not to say that just because i was in the water means im not dehydrated
7144982 then i suppose you wouldnt be offended if i say you look like a gator that could use a cold one
7144983 as long as ya gotta be over 21 to purchase that cold one then well of course i wouldnt be offended

7144987 aj this is john black he used to own this place john this is alligator jackson
7144988 david i always get a kick out of the characters you bring in here i dont know where you found this guy at but i like his black cowboy hat so your from florida so i guess youre a gator fan
7144989 this guy really gets into character you must be a great actor
7144990 thats a close second to budweiser chomp me up a nice cold one would you maam
7144991 marshall has quite of a history in fact huntington has quite of an impressive sports and arts culture for a town its size
7144992 well theres a lot of bigger schools like your gators that have accomplished a lot but marshalls feats are more impressive because they dont have the stature of florida
7144993 kind of like its easier to be successful because everyone knows who you are like big bands and record labels
7144994 exactly its harder for smaller schools to get recognition but marshall has done it
7144995 no it aint too easy for a gator to get into a movie theatre
7144996 well the entire 1970 team was among seventy five people who died in a plane crash supporters reporters and coaches were also lost they recently made a big hollywood movie honoring those people in fact lets go for a ride

7144999 they shall live on in the hearts of their families and friends forever and this memorial records their loss to the university and to the community
7145000 it always brings tears to my eyes to hear that marshall football struggled for a few years but emerged to become the most successful football program in the 90s they even won the i aa national championship in 1996
7145001 florida state too they produced 2 outstanding pro quarterbacks chad pennington and bryon leftwich they both were first round picks in the nfl draft and won a lot of games penningtons playing in florida with the miami dolphins and leftwich is with the steelers randy moss has had a hall of fame career and is with the patriots troy brown has three super bowl champion rings with the patriots marshall has produced other players who have had prolific careers in the pros in basketball hal greer was a big herd star and was later elected to the nba hall of fame
7145002 sounds like the community has a lot to be proud of and it sounds like marshall is loved by the community
7145003 it works great a great marriage marshall provides a lot of jobs and the customers marshall brings in helps keep the economy kickin and of course marshall is a great source of education and its great that huntington and other areas students have a college in their own backyard
7145004 plus it enriches the area culture it provides a nightlife and provides a diverse culture there are many foreign students that come to marshall plus the music rocks
7145005 theres been some great bands coming out of this area like bobaflex hydrogyn american minor have all done well nationally there are many more upandcomers like bud carroll and the southern souls ricky huckaby and jeff ellis kid rock used to play here regularly before he hit it big now he comes back and plays the big house the big sandy superstore arena
7145006 yep it used to be a bar called the ragtime but it burned down it wasnt as nice as rt champs but it has it owns atmosphere it was billy ray and the players it was before achy breaky the girls would line up to get in and of course the guys would line up to be close to the girls
7145007 a lively chompin place eh sounds like my kind of swamp
7145008 he rock the place with cool covers of rock and roll by zep victim of love by the eagles rebel yell by billy idol and plenty of skynyrsd
7145009 so the achy breaky boy is a southern rocker at heart
7145010 sounds like a swampkickin good time so hannahs daddy rocked huntington
7145011 he sure did well drive by first street there used to be a bar called codys and then first street station a band called zachariah used to play here
7145012 theres eagle distributing there provide all of the great budweiser products i wrote beer truck in tribute of one of their old drivers named gale who is now retired
7145013 huntington is a great place with great people a lot of great things have come out of huntington i tell you something that huntington also has a lot of and i know youll be glad to hear this
7145014 yep food well getcha a dozen stewarts hotdogs and head down to chili willis for some classic mexican food theres great food from one end of huntington to the other
7145015 chomp on huntington i think im gonna love it here
7145016 davis place the song from ajs first cd that i wrote about the huntington bar the bar is a happening fun place but the song is kind of melchancoly because it is about good friends i knew from there that are no longer with us heres the words
7145017 et celui l avec le dauphin beuaaaark quil est laid et celui l avec la petite fille mais pourquoi y a t il du rose et des paillettes partout
7145018 ben cest pas grave sils sont tous moches maman on na qu en prendre un uni et on va le d corer avec toi dans ton atelier
7145019 would have all kinds of administration things to add on
7145020 yum yum yum can we have a piece of that
7145021 everything absolutely everything has been for this i knew it was a far chance but i did everything absolutely everything i could to give myself the best chance of doing it its actually happened i never thought it would
7145022 coming back and doing everything i did was to win an olympic gold medal when i was training every single day twice a day eleven sessions a week thirty hours a week before every single dive i said to myself i want to win an olympic gold
7145023 thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
7145024 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
7145025 by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another
7145026 whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother
7145027 chimpanzees are indifferent to the welfare of unrelated group members
7145028 my plan for the workshop is to investigate the visible and tangible parameters of graphic design type specimens halftone screens and in particular colour tests and calibration charts and make a book of our own self produced tests which we will send to print on friday afternoon using the online print on demand system lulu
7145029 what is great is you can send the book to other printers for comparison
7145030 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7145031 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7145032 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs
7145033 the kurdish sunni and shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws administration and internal security the central government would control border defense foreign affairs and oil revenues
7145034 the original biden plan seems less relevant in iraq today than at any point
7145035 the trend in parliament is clearly in a more national direction with political parties coming together across sectarian divides
7145036 in other words there is a very strong iraqi mobilization against precisely the core elements of the biden plan and it would be extremely unwise of the democratic party to make bidens ideas the centerpiece of their iraq strategy
7145037 we dont support establishing federal regions on a sectarian basis for example our region is not ethnic it contains kurds and non kurds the regions should be established on a geographic basis
7145038 his project was the reason behind the unity of many political blocs that once differed in viewpoints
7145039 such a person if he would assume the vice presidency post would not serve to improve iraq usa relations
7145040 aunque me lastime alguna verdad que vos me digas no dud s en decirme nada por nada del mundo te qued s callada y menos todav a disfraces de verdad una mentira
7145041 ese era su deseo quer a estar alegre parao como era l firme

7145298 they wanted provocation at sea but they wont get it we know who the passengers are and what they are bringing with them and so we have no problem letting them through
7145299 there will be no contact between the navy and the boats
7145300 we are following the development and if they are looking for a provocation we will know how to avoid it
7145301 we are not experienced sailors as a result there is concern about the health and safety of the people on board
7145302 i brought the kids so if they the activists arrive i can tell them welcome and thank you for not forgetting us
7145303 nobody thinks that these boats will break the siege in a practical way but this is a moral message what is happening in gaza is illegal and inhumane and must be halted

7145371 im sorry but you dont have enough money to buy this doll
7145372 you know that you dont have enough money to buy this doll my dear
7145373 its the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for christmas she was sure that santa claus would bring it to her
7145374 no santa claus cant bring it to her where she is now i have to give the doll to my mommy so that she can give it to my sister when she goes there
7145375 my sister has gone to be with god daddy says that mommy is going to see god very soon too so i thought that she could take the doll with her to give it to my sister
7145376 i told daddy to tell mommy not to go yet i need her to wait until i come back from the mall
7145377 i want mommy to take my picture with her so she wont forget me
7145378 i love my mommy and i wish she doesnt have to leave me but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister
7145379 suppose we check again just in case you do have enough money for the doll
7145380 i asked last night before i went to sleep for god to make sure i had enough money to buy this doll so that mommy could give it to my sister he heard me
7145381 i also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mommy but i didnt dare to ask god for too much but he gave me enough to buy the doll and a white rose
7145382 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7145383 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7145384 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7145385 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7145386 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7145387 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7145388 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7145389 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7145390 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7145391 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7145392 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7145393 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7145394 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7145395 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7145396 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7145397 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7145398 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7145399 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7145400 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7145401 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7145402 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7145403 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7145404 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7145405 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7145406 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7145407 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7145408 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7145409 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7145410 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7145411 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7145412 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

7145536 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7145537 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7145538 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7145539 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on climate change

7145549 what this country needs from the government is the preparation and delivery of an economy statement which sets out the international economic environment in which australia finds itself
7145550 it is not a political statement it is a statement which reflects the gravity of economic circumstances in which the country finds itself
7145551 most importantly what are the governments specific policy prescriptions to address the challenges that this country now faces
7145552 i dont think theres a place for a mini budget but theres certainly a place for a strong economic statement
7145553 i dont know anyone who has but it might be possible when the tide is out
7145554 secretly tape recorded by the fbi on june 25 2006
7145555 through the alaska legislature with bill allen an oil services executive accused of providing the senator with about 250 000 in undisclosed financial benefits

7145557 lieberman on attending rnc convention i will do it and speak against partisan mud slinging rice refuses to interrupt her holidays to deal with georgian conflict
7145558 is obama bashing american dream by bashing mccains 7 homes
7145559 did you know a guy named happy streelman who used to live around here a few years back
7145560 i wasnt planning on it being as meaningful a week as its become
7145561 he is one of this citys most engaging media stars
7145562 when they were leaving the police station it was under the understanding that perhaps he hadnt shown the best judgement there were a number of people that took offence to the child being naked in the group and subjected to peoples scrutiny
7145563 it sounds like its been a good lesson all around
7145564 the leaders of this event do not support what the guy did
7145565 the issue of transportation and extreme events in global warming
7145566 no one can fully invest themselves into a song like dylan
7145567 the question then is why dylan would choose to give back to one man and one man alone especially when its already been established that other people helped young bob shape his musical style
7145568 heres to van ronk and von schmidt and paul nelson too
7145569 maybe bob just felt woody deeper in his bones knew that hed taken more from him not just musically but in attitude in the way that woody knew what music meant how it could affect people how it could change the world even just a little bit
7145570 when theres something on yer mind you wanna be saying that somebody someplace oughta be hearin and no matter how you try you just cant say it and you say to yourself just what am i doin what am i saying what am i knowing on this guitar im playing in the song im singin in the tune im hummin in the words im writin in the words that im thinkin you can either go to the church of your choice or you can go to brooklyn state hospital youll find god in the church of your choice youll find woody guthrie in brooklyn state hospital
7145571 some people might complain about how dylan ripped off one of guthries tunes for his tribute
7145572 im still surprised this wasnt the album closer it should have been honestly its hard to argue that everything shouldnt have built to the final word the last thoughts on woody guthrie and the legacy dylan was attempting to harness for himself
7145573 if you want any more you can sing it yourself
7145574 to give back to one man and one man alone
7145575 he doesnt make any small talk between songs in concert
7145576 how artists often end up as a mishmash of the styles of their heroes
7145577 the last living embodiment of the link to a lost bygone era of traditional music
7145578 are you gonna play i want to hold your hand
7145579 war the following things are what it is good for absolutely nothing
7145580 watered down love is certainly no angelina but i wouldnt want to be without it you know
7145581 lord i really miss my baby shes in some far off land
7145582 the landscape is glowin gleamin in the golden light of day
7145583 she says you cant repeat the past i say what do you mean you cant of course you can
7145584 i been gamblin so long lord i aint got much more to lose
7145585 woke up this morning i mustve bet my money wrong
7145586 well you have to understand that im not a melodist my songs are either based on old protestant hymns or carter family songs or variations of the blues form what happens is ill take a song i know and simply start playing it in my head thats the way i meditate i meditate on a song ill be playing bob nolans tumbling tumbleweeds for instance in my head constantly while im driving a car or talking to a person or sitting around or whatever people will think they are talking to me and im talking back but im not im listening to a song in my head at a certain point some words will change and ill start writing a song i wrote blowin in the wind in 10 minutes just put words to an old spiritual probably something i learned from carter family records thats the folk music tradition you use whats been handed down the times they are a changin is probably from an old scottish folk song
7145587 i often find myself searching out the origins of the samples and that often leads to my musical vocabulary being enriched and broadened its not quite the same here i severely doubt most people today have any interest in traditional music but given how much dylan still loves traditional music i think that idea might have been wedged somewhere in the back of his mind
7145588 music and two lines by muddy waters lyrics by bob dylan additional lyrics by henry timrod
7145589 t make new sounds out of old sounds an new words out of old words an not t worry about the new rules
7145590 i am predicting 100 defaults on all non fixed rate loans from 2005 to 2007 no one in america is using that negative a forecast do you ever hear anyone say 100 of those loans from that era are going to default i am

7145680 call in sick today were flying to puerto rico for the weekend
7145681 an energetic people who always wanted to work and the short ears had to moil and toil and help them make the walls and statues which led to jealousy and dissatisfaction
7145682 the long ears last idea was to rid the whole of easter island of superfluous stone so that all the earth could be cultivated this work was begun on the poike plateau the easternmost part of the island and the short ears had to carry every single loose stone to the edge of the cliff and fling it into the sea this is why there is not a single loose stone on the grassy peninsula of poike today while the rest of the island is thickly covered with black and red scree and lava blocks
7145683 now things were going too far for the short ears they were tired of carrying stones for the long ears they decided on war the long ears fled from every other part of the island and established themselves at the easternmost end on the cleared poike peninsula
7145684 under the command of their chief iko they dug a trench nearly two miles long which separated the poike plateau from the rest of the island
7145685 this trench they filled with a great quantity of branches and tree trunks till it was like a gigantic far flung pyre ready to be set on fire if the short ears on the plain below tried to storm the slope leading to the plateau
7145686 but one of the long ears had a short ear wife her name was moko pingei and she was living up on poike with her husband
7145687 one night the short ears spies saw moko pingei sitting and plaiting a basket right at one end of ikos ditch and the short ears stole one by one past the place where she sat at the very edge of the cliff
7145688 only three of the long ears succeeded in leaping through the fire and escaping one of them is called ororoina and another vai but the name of the third is forgotten
7145689 they hid in a cave which the inhabitants can point out to this day there they were found and two of them were stabbed to death with sharp stakes while the third and last ororoina was allowed to remain alive as the only surviving long ear
7145690 ororoina was taken to the house of one of the short ears who was named pipi horeko there he married a short ear of the haoa family and had many descendants the last of which are still living on the island now
7145691 silky and wavy as found amongst europeans they have long skulls and remarkably tall bodies hair experts have shown by microscopic analysis that the red hair has all the characteristics that ordinarily distinguish a nordic hair type from that of mongols or american indians
7145692 sea foam because they were white skinned and vanished like foam over the sea

7145743 the whole thing was improvisation and they would just give us a situation and we just had to run with it and see what would happen we never ever knew what was going to happen from second to second it was like being at camp it was so much fun as an actress its your ultimate dream to be able to do improv
7145744 by gigi gaston came into being according to their website because
7145745 if the project an eu olympic team seems ambitious the concept is rather easy to understand at every international sports competition we realise that if the european countries medals were counted together the european union would have a much stronger weight in the traditional medals list and would be able to really compete with the usa china or russia
7145746 the german french italian and dutch teams have all done well too it is frankly bonkers to claim that all our countries athletes would do better if they were put into one team and made to compete under an eu flag
7145747 why on earth is the eu commission lavishing taxpayers money on these euro federalists to come up with nutty ideas like this
7145748 it sets a very chilling precedent that someone who is brought back gets the book thrown at them
7145749 gush shalom calls upon the government to let peace boats reach gaza
7145750 the driver told me the vehicle got in his lane and he tried to avoid a collision and went to his right and lost control

7145754 this discovery gives immensely powerful support to the proposition that dinosaur fossils are not millions of years old at all but were mostly fossilized under catastrophic conditions a few thousand years ago at most
7145755 there were never any monks involved in the process of preserving the true texts of the bible
7145756 oh please dont tell jackieboy how to do it were up to our ears in sophomoric useless mumbo jumbo already
7145757 yes those are his drawings we all know what they look like its the fact that they are being used in the context that they are by rearanging the order that animals develop from conception and showing similarity between the species nowadays they use up close high resolution pictures but say the same thing
7145758 why would you start cutting and pasting now isnt that against your rules
7145759 how do you figure you cant prove that anything is 65 million years old none of the dating methods work you cant use the geological column because to make that work you have to use circular reasoning again a failure
7145760 we can only 100 date something and thats through history and we can only go back 4000 or so years with that
7145761 so to pull up 65 million year old dino bones and still have soft tissue in them is ludicrous
7145762 i love when evos find prehistorc fish still alive and go look theyve survived for millions of years how cold that happen
7145763 no it is not a translation of a translation it is a true and accurate translation of true and accurate
7145764 the answer to line 2 above is that you ask stupid questions
7145765 the answer to line 1 is obvious to anyone who knows anything at all about manuscript evidence which you apparently dont
7145766 i do not feel obliged to believe that the same god who has endowed us with sense reason and intellect has intended us to forego their use

7145774 i have a real legitimate shot at making the chase and a great shot at running well this weekend
7145775 the pole is huge for us this track obviously track position pit stall selection those things are really important
7145776 i had to pedal it pretty hard coming off of turn two because i got back to the gas pretty quick and it shoved the front end a little bit
7145777 all in all it ended up being a pretty good lap it gave us a good pit selection and good starting position
7145778 i have a real legitimate shot at making the chase and a great shot at running well this weekend
7145779 the pole is huge for us this track obviously track position pit stall selection those things are really important
7145780 i had to pedal it pretty hard coming off of turn two because i got back to the gas pretty quick and it shoved the front end a little bit
7145781 all in all it ended up being a pretty good lap it gave us a good pit selection and good starting position
7145782 the pressure is going to be how do we get this war right
7145783 in the case of iraq the americans had a big strategic rethink about how they were handling it
7145784 that kind of rethink is whats going to have to take place with afghanistan
7145785 were not in the blair kind of situation but it may come
7145786 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7145787 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7145788 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7145789 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7145790 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7145791 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7145792 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7145793 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7145794 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7145795 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7145796 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7145797 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7145798 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7145799 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7145800 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7145801 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7145802 it is neither wealth nor splendor but tranquility and occupation which give happiness
7145803 there were many tense expeditions when we were in close proximity to soviet submarines and ships
7145804 being on a sub it was constantly impressed upon us who the enemy was there would be little posters reminding us to be quiet if you accidentally closed a hatch or door too hard that sound could actually emit out into the water and give your position away
7145805 for about two weeks we were in the north atlantic in a covert area and it was necessary to remain at periscope depth which is 50 feet underwater
7145806 it was hard to stay at that depth without breaking the surface and giving away our position it was extremely tense for those two weeks wed spend six hour watches in the control room just leaning over the steering mechanism with our eyes glued to the gauges as the sub bobbed up and down in the water another time we were discovered by the soviets and had to make a quick getaway
7145807 it was as close to the real thing as we could get
7145808 we had the missile launchers ready and we were all manned up we could go to war at a seconds notice not a minutes notice
7145809 while we were doing it we were using our radar to look into russia but of course we didnt tell them that
7145810 i said were not going out on deck we dont know if theyre shooting or what we checked every missile and it was the only time that ive ever seen the ready to load light steady on the monitor we sat there for a long time and eventually the captain came on and said what happened and to stand down
7145811 you lived under an air of suspicion and intrigue at the same time
7145812 being young soldiers you also had an air of cockiness about you and you felt invincible
7145813 but later i found out that this happened on a regular basis
7145814 you lived your normal life and did your job but you always looked over your shoulder wondering if you were being followed and you had to be careful what you said now as someone thats more stable in life i wonder how we lived through that but back then we loved what we were doing every soldier there was ready to do everything he could to preserve freedom
7145815 for the older georgians who remember the soviet domination i think theyre scared to death that its all going to come back
7145816 everything from communism to the social injustice and tyranny that marked that era it upsets me also because ive seen what its like for three years behind the wall and if you havent lived it you dont know what it is
7145817 regardless of who started the conflict between russia and georgia russia is taking their time to leave
7145818 if youve ever seen the dark shadow of old world communism before the wall fell its scary we had a saying when you went into east berlin you set your watch back 20 years they were that oppressed and a lot of them didnt even realize it
7145819 we had the opportunity to see how the other side lived and i actually enjoyed the experience i think it gives you a different outlook on life you dont take everything for granted and sometimes theres a price to be paid for things its a shame that we have to have it but when somebody threatens your lifestyle theres an opportunity to protect it
7145820 they are nowhere to be found they were accompanied by a somali translator and were to visit parts of lower shabelle region they are believed to have been kidnapped
7145821 we heard that unknown gunmen abducted two foreign journalists a white man and a white woman
7145822 ill say straight up to you john mccain is genuinely a friend of mine
7145823 but the harsh truth is ladies and gentlemen you cant change america when you boast on the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush ladies and gentlemen thats what he said
7145824 you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 percent of the time
7145825 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7145826 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7145827 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7145828 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead
7145829 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7145830 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7145831 confident that we can take this country in a new direction that we are ready to overcome the adversity of the last eight years that we wont just win this election in november well restore that fair shot at your dreams that is at the core of who joe biden and i are as people and what america is as a nation
7145832 ok mr moore turn around and well get your back
7145833 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7145834 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7145835 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7145836 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7145837 nos pidi el gobierno de m xico que le di ramos un chance m s a los empresarios a ver si nos entendemos de inmediato le dije s y ayer le instru al vicepresidente carrizalez nosotros queremos arreglar eso amistosamente como lo arreglamos con los franceses
7145838 cada quien echa su cuento al presidente de m xico le hab an echado el cuento qui n los empresarios aqu nosotros estamos obligados a defender no el inter s de los empresarios el inter s de venezuela que no necesariamente es el mismo de los empresarios extranjeros no necesariamente y muchas veces es contrario
7145839 los mexicanos han sido prepotentes han retado al gobierno en reuniones
7145840 musharraf was a curse on our country he was a friend of america and an enemy of islam
7145841 he will be accountable for his crimes in the next world and in this one too i hope he has done the work of the unbeliever and killed so many innocent muslims
7145842 the army is determined to continue with the war against militants but it can only be won with political backing to convince the people that it is their war and not americas
7145843 the system is the same you see new faces in power but nothing more
7145844 the state has failed in pakistan if people want to do anything here they have to do it for themselves
7145845 washington is asking what the hell is going to happen to the war on terror insurgency is like a disease now in pakistan it is spreading outside the tribal areas and the signs are that it is going to be messy for some time to come the concerns are where do we go from here and how do we deal with those guys who are hiding out in pakistan and hitting our soldiers in afghanistan
7145846 the war is on our soil and our boys are dying we will defend our land we are tough on extremism but we need to have democratic wisdom rather than a martial mindset it is in our interest that this war on pakistan is won by us
7145847 so many things have gone wrong but it was demonstrations by the people that got rid of musharraf and that gives our country a new chance
7145848 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7145849 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7145850 he put a lot of time and effort into looking for somewhere he knew he would be comfortable
7145851 somebody offered to give us a ride and i was in the passenger seat
7145852 i heard an alarm go off but its downtown vancouver and theres a lot of alarms going off
7145853 as es tu voz melod a incansable que hace vibrar a mi coraz n belleza inexplicable que de tu boca naci
7145854 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 cast iron damage proof
7145855 the contrast was all the more striking because until that point shed always had a memory like a website
7145856 from the fateful day of our lunch telltale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7145857 whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7145858 it might be something innocuous such as what time is my car coming or when am i going to the hairdresser but the fact she needed to repeat them opened a new and frightening chapter in our lives
7145859 i feel the travers is certainly the second most prestigious 3 year old race
7145860 its a race to win a race for the ages
7145861 my head was down and i was riding hard i just happened to have the right nod at the right time
7145862 with the kind of trip he had and to do what he did it takes a special horse it shows hes right up there with the best of them
7145863 i thought he went well he had to go around horses and he got beat by one of the kentucky derby favorites
7145864 i think the players were nervous in the first inning they were feeling a little pressure
7145865 i dont think that worked too well because no one took advantage of the volume discount
7145866 playing in these great major tournaments thats always been my dream
7145867 and now i get the chance to play in the u s open and the masters i think its going to be a great experience
7145868 ive got it finished out with some additional chrome and such
7145869 i really tried to handle this in a quiet professional manner
7145870 thats when one of the board members told my wife that if we didnt like it we could move
7145871 it happens to come off the same assembly line in dearborn mich as the ford f 150
7145872 our oldest child turned 16 and we needed a third vehicle so we opted for something safe so he would be up high

7145881 i wasnt planning on it being as meaningful a week as its become
7145882 the corby case has raised substantive issues occurring on australian soil that could point to ms corbys innocence
7145883 our government has a primary responsibility to investigate whether one of its citizens has been unjustly accused as a result of happenings here in australia
7145884 this is an australian problem it is not an indonesian problem
7145885 the corby case illustrates that when australian travellers arrive in foreign destinations they are going to be stuck with whatever is found in their luggage and whatever justice system applies they need to have confidence that they arrive with the same contents in their bags that they left with
7145886 corby claims the drugs were not in her bag when she handed them to the airline and australian airline authorities are apparently unable to deny that assertion
7145887 this is an issue that affects every australian who intends to travel it should be comprehensively investigated so that australians can be confident that luggage given over to the security of an airline will remain secure
7145888 it is barely forty years since that beloved and fearless christian scholar dean stanley spoke thus of the miracles recorded of the prophet elisha
7145889 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7145890 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7145891 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7145892 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7145893 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7145894 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7145895 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7145896 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on climate change
7145897 north american and australian tertiary students are disillusioned with public and commercial conventional terrestrial radio and are fighting for and building new alternative media outlets such as net radio stations
7145898 the students argue terrestrial radio fails to provide access to the 30 new alternative music genres on offer on web radio
7145899 youths are huge consumers of radio and net radio is definitely the way of the future
7145900 net radio streaming in australia really began in 1999 but its uptake has been slow in comparison to the united states by january 2001 there were 50 free to air traditional radio stations streaming their programs online and about 24 internet only radio stations in australia
7145901 boeddhisme en christendom beginnen met dezelfde vraag waarom is er zoveel pijn zoveel ellende zoveel oorlog in de wereld en beide pogen op die vraag een antwoord te geven het boeddhisme zoekt de oplossing in de vereniging met het hoogste wezen door middel van meditatie het christendom kondigt al op de eerste bladzijde van de bijbel over de zonde van adam en eva de verlossing aan
7145902 elke reis wordt zwaarder deze reis was weer zwaarder dan de vorige bovendien treed ik op 2 februari in bij de benedictijnen in teteringen
7145903 maar de gematigden bepalen niet het beeld dat zijn fatah en hamas de elkaar uitmoordende soennieten en sjiieten in irak het zijn verschijnselen als de jihad de heilige oorlog die het beeld bepalen de islam heeft helaas een trieste traditie op dat gebied islamieten hebben in de geschiedenis hun mystici als ketters veroordeeld en verbrand zeker christenen hebben anderen en elkaar ook uitgemoord de kruistochten waren verschrikkelijk maar die zijn wel voorbij islamieten zitten in 2007 nog met dit soort twisten als ze daar niet vanaf komen geen orde op zaken stellen in eigen kring dan zal de islam aan aantrekkingskracht verliezen
7145904 daarom groeit het ook in nederland in cadzand zit een boeddhistisch opleidingscentrum van jewelste het bestaat uit tien gebouwen ik was laatst op een school in terneuzen en vroeg de leraren of ze dat centrum kenden dat was niet het geval toen stak een leerling in de klas zijn vinger op ik ben boeddhist zei hij gewoon een jongen uit terneuzen je zult dat meer gaan zien de monniken in de abdij van zundert leren mensen mediteren ze hebben zich bekwaamd in de zen boeddhistische meditatietechniek zij leren er jezelf leeg te maken en die leegte te vullen met christus het loopt daar storm
7145905 dat is hun kastensysteem india kent 300 miljoen kastenlozen die hebben een erbarmelijk bestaan ze zijn rechteloos en worden op een wrede manier onderdrukt ik vind het moeilijk met hindoes tot een gemeenschappelijke emotie te komen boeddhistische monniken versta ik ook niet maar ik herken me in hun beleving maar een reis door een hindoeland als india ervaar ik als veel zwaarder dan door andere niet christelijke landen
7145906 kijk in ons eigen bisdom naar de verschillen tussen katholieken en protestanten de burgemeester van hulst zei wel eens katholieken in zeeuws vlaanderen hebben meer plezier bij een uitvaart dan protestanten op walcheren bij een bruiloft
7145907 de amerikanen zijn daar doodsbenauwd van in de international harold tribune zag ik laatst drie artikelen over china naast elkaar op de voorpagina staan dat zegt genoeg chinezen zijn van nature werkers werken en vooruitgang boeken zit hen in de genen ik heb dat op mijn laatste reis weer waargenomen chinezen zetten op veel terreinen de toon ik heb daar in indonesi nog eens goed over nagedacht waarom maken aziatische landen zulke geweldige progressie terwijl in afrika de stammen elkaar nog aan het uitmoorden zijn het moet in het verschil tussen de rassen zitten zwarte rassen zijn minder op de toekomst gericht de rassen zijn gelijkwaardig maar niet gelijkvaardig zo bedacht ik ik heb lang op dat woord gelijkvaardig geproefd en ik denk dat die waarneming klopt natuurlijk mogen we ons daar niet bij neerleggen al in het boek genesis geeft god ons de opdracht ons voor de aarde en onze medemensen in te zetten onze kerk laat dat veel te veel liggen in organen als de vn en de wereld handels organisatie moeten we veel meer op de trom slaan daar worden allesbepalende beslissingen genomen een vanuit de katholieke inspiratie gecorrigeerd kapitalisme heeft toekomst
7145908 he could see both of his testicles hanging on the outside of his body

7145910 natural and artificial biomaterials are now commonly used in medical applications in order to treat augment or replace a tissue organ or function of the body dlc is tough as well as slippery so substances do not stick to it
7145911 it is also inert and does not generate an immune or inflammatory reaction within the body
7145912 brunel university has developed the protocols to coat a hydrated proteinaceous sheet with dlc we know that we can generate coatings of varying and controlled thickness and that the coatings are stable inside the body
7145913 we are currently seeking additional funding to complete our research
7145914 there is plenty of research to be done but the findings could potentially have a huge impact on tackling one of britains major fatal diseases

7146086 racism in the thoughtless cognitively dissonant way that allows good people who identify as open minded democrats read hillary supporters threatening to sit out this election to embrace an overtly counterfactual mess of impossibly contradictory slanders and slurs the only true consistency in the lies that trail obama is the degree to which they allow a diversity of options with which to express that resentment
7146087 eight years of horrendous policies have left us a corrupted justice system undue executive secrecy and governmental unaccountability scandals too numerous to count endless war colossal levels of administrative mismanagement and a ruined economy if one was going to vote for clinton but will not now for obama what else could it be but the most insidious self defeating form of identity politics if one were at all invested in practical outcomes however could one fail to heed these larger stakes

7146168 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
7146169 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
7146170 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
7146171 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
7146172 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
7146173 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
7146174 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
7146175 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
7146176 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
7146177 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
7146178 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
7146179 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
7146180 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
7146181 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
7146182 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
7146183 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
7146184 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
7146185 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
7146186 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
7146187 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
7146188 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
7146189 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
7146190 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
7146191 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
7146192 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
7146193 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
7146194 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
7146195 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
7146196 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
7146197 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
7146198 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
7146199 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
7146200 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
7146201 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness

7146203 the stock moves very much with the market and should do well in a u s stock rally
7146204 i favor the pristine and classic all u s stock market and all bond market approach
7146205 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged
7146206 the three factor model is as fama and french have repeatedly emphasized only a model it is not reality
7146207 i never attempt to make money on the stock market i buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years
7146208 unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50 without becoming panic stricken you should not be in the stock market

7146303 sorry about that tammy i thought i heard something now where was i
7146304 you really really really must promise not to tell anyone else
7146305 oh gosh tammy im not sure i can tell you this
7146306 tammy he was playing with his um he was playing with his thingy
7146307 i saw him in the shower accidentally once but thats all
7146308 um for a short while yeah i was getting these really really strange feelings in my you know down there it was making me go gooey watching him rub it i just couldnt help myself you know seeing him there doing that
7146309 oh tam he was running his fist up and down that thick shaft of his it got me sooooooo hot i just had to
7146310 i just couldnt help but um play with myself too right there in the doorway of his bedroom
7146311 oh my god lucy oh my god i cant believe you no way oh jeez what happened then
7146312 and then oh gosh tammy um i dont know if i should
7146313 he looked really mad at first i thought he was going to shout at me i was really scared but then his face softened and he smiled and then he saw where my hand was
7146314 i know he kind of gestured me over to the bed and i dunno why but something made me go i didnt want to but i was just powerless i guess
7146315 oh lucy i cannot believe no im oh my god okay then what
7146316 he sat me down and took hold of my hand he smelt it then raised it to his lips and sucked both my fingers
7146317 then he then he placed my hand around his hard cock
7146318 he did oh tammy it was even bigger close up my fingers hardly fitted around then he leaned in and kissed me on the lips it was the hottest kiss ive ever known and then and then he asked me to you know to stroke it so i did
7146319 i started to rub it up and down for him he was really moaning so i kept pumping it harder and harder till he cried out then tammy oh gosh then he came a massive spurt all over my fingers and his belly i was so embarrassed i dashed off to my room
7146320 i cant believe you and with your own brother too
7146321 an hour later he came to my room um to apologise you can imagine how embarrassed we both were how we were saying it was wrong and must never happen again and we both meant it too then almost without realising joshs hand was resting on my thigh then stroking it so lovingly it felt really good so right and i just didnt have the heart to tell him to stop i couldnt have found the words anyway then he whispered in my ear that it was only fair he returned the favour
7146322 it was like i was paralysed tammy i couldnt have moved if id wanted to he tugged down my shorts and started by stroking my lower belly ever so softly around the navel it felt incredible and i was all tingly his fingers moved down and stroked my pussy just the hair brushing through and teasing me like crazy till i begged him to put them inside me it was amazing a hundred no a thousand times better than doing it yourself he has the most amazing hands just like dad
7146323 it was like josh knew exactly what he was doing precisely where to touch me to send me crazy i was so wet his fingers just squelched inside me they slid right over my clittie and i think i must have passed out when i came round he was still rubbing away he whispered how gorgeous i was and i just came and came and came
7146324 oh jeez tammy the door i think oh god i think it might be josh i gotta go
7146325 daddy what is it what are you what are you doing at home
7146326 ill be back soon daddy and ill bring you a nice hot drink
7146327 no josh not now not with dad in the house
7146328 tammy has a cold too i must have caught it off her
7146329 i wasnt aware you could catch a cold from talking to someone on the telephone
7146330 wanna join us let poor dad have some peace and quiet
7146331 i dont think i feel like going out you go daddy and i will stay in console each other
7146332 you sleep tight daddy hope you feel better in the morning
7146333 lucy sounds in a bad way dad maybe i should stay home today
7146334 you go out and enjoy yourself young man im still a little under the weather myself the boss isnt expecting me in today
7146335 okay ill probably be out for a while see you at teatime
7146336 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
7146337 hey ive heard of you youre supposed to be pretty awesome at this game
7146338 i really think candace and sylvia those are the babies
7146339 sylvia did the running hook tonight that i showed her about five days ago for me its about passing the torch its a clich but thats the way it is
7146340 i thought i was retired after 96 olympics gold in atlanta
7146341 they all told me stories about how when they were little they watched me and wanted to be like me and came to my camp and got my autograph
7146342 this team stands out from her other three olympic squads in my heart and mind
7146343 weve only been together one month and ive never seen a team become so selfless in such a short period of time before we got together i thought i hope theyre not about themselves how many points they score i couldnt have been more wrong
7146344 the case is not yet settled and to me it is absurd that with a disease that has a median survival rate of nine months companies can be given over a year to make a compensation offer
7146345 it is a horrific disease and no monetary figure could compensate for the deterioration in a persons health and their suffering but at least if there was a quick resolution it would be an awful lot easier on the family without that to worry about
7146346 they would be breaking off old asbestos lagging and replacing it with new asbestos lagging which they mixed up beside where he was working
7146347 we have every sympathy with john macdougalls family in their grief in this case as in all others the mod considers claims for compensation on the basis of legal liability where there is a proven legal liability to pay compensation we do so
7146348 how can you call yourself a craft distillery when your working from the same base spirit
7146349 the world wants to kill me from the inside out
7146350 which emy said on msn last night and it made me laugh
7146351 be a force of fortune instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world should devote itself to making you happy
7146352 preservation is not a consequence of our own merits or strength but of gods free mercy that we neither totally fall from faith and grace nor do we continue and perish finally in our times of backsliding which if it were on our shoulders would most certainly happen however since it is not on our shoulders but gods it is completely impossible that we should fall away why because his counsel cannot be changed his promise cannot fail his call according to purpose cannot be revoked neither can the merit intercession john 17 and protection of jesus be rendered ineffectual neither can the sealing of the holy spirit be frustrated or extinguished
7146353 the killings did not occur but if they did occur they were justified during the violent fast moving battle in fallujah
7146354 the unique sacrifices sgt nelson has made for all of us that we all live under the blanket of freedom he provides with the blood that flows through his veins
7146355 intels next generation cpu microarchitecture which was recently given the official processor family name of core i7 was one of the big topics of discussion at idf intel claims that nehalem represents its biggest platform architecture change to date this might be true but it is not a from the ground up completely new architecture either intel representatives disclosed that nehalem shares a significant portion of the p6 gene pool does not include many new instructions and has approximately the same length pipeline as brings hyper threading back to intel processors and while hyper threading has been criticized in the past as being energy inefficient intel claims their current iteration of hyper threading on nehalem is much better in that regard
7146356 the thing is today we have the knowledge and complexity to fire up kilowatt systems and more but theyre costly running certainly theres the extreme hardcore gamers who wont mind running the hottest most powerhungry quad crossfire system but theyre few and far between

7146380 matagal na yon anak ngayong natuto ka na uling magmahal siguro naman panahon na rin para kalimutan ang nakaraan
7146381 sa tingin ko naman mahal na mahal ka ni lia kung ano man ang maging desisyon niya kung dito kayo o doon wag mo na munang masyadong isipin ang mahalaga magkasama kayo kahit saan ang mahalaga yung kayong dalawa hindi mo naman siguro siya hahayaan na mawala dahil lang sa distansiya ng lugar nyo sa diba alam nating mahirap pero ganon talaga mahal ka ni lia rico sapat na yon

7146402 one of the reasons why its possible the reserve bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong because the surplus is very substantial
7146403 thered be no way known the reserve bank would be able to contemplate putting down interest rates again
7146404 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of two per cent
7146405 the end result if they succeed will be that it will be harder for the reserve bank to cut interest rates

7146471 even genetically obama whose east african descent is apparent in his unusual features has only a distant relationship to the west africans who are the ancestors of almost all african americans

7146488 i used to know this guy named happy streelman we used to call him hap because he was always so happy and that was my dads father

7146493 is a gathering of artists most of whom were visual artists before becoming musicians or whose visual roots at the heat of their artistic process are often little known and viewed as separate from their musical fame
7146494 rock n roll is uneven in its range from musicians who happened to go to art school to revered artists whose work embraces multiple disciplines like
7146495 there was a consensus not to punish through ejection players who voluntarily get into a fight

7146502 if freedom loving people throughout the world do not speak out against chinas oppression in china and tibet we have lost all moral authority to speak on behalf of human rights anywhere in the world
7146503 most of the chinese people are used to the squat toilet but nowadays more and more people demand sit down toilets
7146504 tibetans get the low income and the hard labor jobs and although there are some han who make the same as us most of those who were brought in by the boss make twice as much money
7146505 theyre all paid as technicians even though some of them really dont know anything
7146506 we are unhappy that the state suppresses us and as long as the dalai isnt allowed to return we will remain unhappy
7146507 we are in the midst of a fierce struggle involving blood and fire a life and death struggle with the dalai clique
7146508 we must not develop anti chinese feelings whether we like it or not we have to live side by side
7146509 when need be will act decisively in a way that continues to bring order to the financial markets

7146513 i cut a couple loose nothing tightened up after i let one go
7146514 if he feels all right hell go to the bullpen monday beyond bullpen thats beyond monday
7146515 i had to look around on the mound just to make sure i knew what i was doing you dont think youre gone that long and then you get back on and it seems like youre throwing a mile away
7146516 you get that peace of mind to know you can still throw i want to get into a game just to get back in there and try to help the team win
7146517 i dont have any doubt hell pitch this year weve got to try to figure out what hes going to do but a day at a time
7146518 if you run out of games in the minor leagues then theres simulated games theres a lot of different things you can do
7146519 i definitely want to get something bad on the road it must be big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about
7146520 every power cut even if it lasts for just a few minutes delays water production by three hours
7146521 there wasnt a lot of focus from the former regime on the long term consequences of dumping raw sewage onto river banks
7146522 we have people illegally siphoning water from the pipelines using potable water to irrigate their gardens and fill their fish pools
7146523 even water used by car washes this wasted water could be used in areas already suffering from shortages
7146524 the water is dirty but what can we do we dont have any other choice
7146525 people like us who earn three or four dollars a day we spend it all on generators
7146526 as soon as you build new plants and you lay down new networks you will be able to service more people
7146527 now they apparently have enough resources and theyre slowly moving toward using those resources

7146530 but it just sits there behind you it doesnt stop you doing anything
7146531 as far as israeli law is concerned it is a part of israel like tel aviv or haifa so why are we even talking about considering giving it back
7146532 its a tragedy there because there are two nations in one place
7146533 here it was different we never did something wrong to the arabs because when we came here it was empty
7146534 when we started we were pioneers we came here with the governments blessing
7146535 to continue your life here as a normal human being you must decide its business as usual otherwise you leave
7146536 we can live in a smaller israel the real problem is that arabs cant live with israelis they dont want to for them we are always strangers like the crusaders
7146537 about 70 percent say they are not willing to exchange the golan for a real peace treaty so we have good support
7146538 technical arrangements are important but not the heart of the matter water demilitarisation open access all these can be fixed in negotiations im speaking about our basic rights here after 40 years this should be on the table
7146539 some people say its ours its biblical its annexed others say the same holiness exists for peace i say find a middle way if not its not a necessity were here to stay

7146587 now we are told that certain laws need to be changed and that the nation will have to accept a peoples charter without these drastic unconstitutional amendments we will not have elections
7146588 the peoples charter is a disgraceful document that will not have the support of law abiding citizens
7146589 it will not stop coups and it will not stop racism this peoples charter wont change much but to increase the militarization of the state and escalate the devolution of traditional structures

7146881 were not saying it didnt happen were just saying that what were getting from independent witnesses is not what was said
7146882 if the crown wants to release it it will be up to them
7146883 when it comes to any kind of disturbance we have to deal with the person we feel is the most hostile and the most volatile
7146884 walking down the street or being black which is it
7146885 they told him not to appear in court on the 18th and thats the last i heard

7146919 computers like cats can operate crossdimensionally the trick is in getting them to do what you want
7146920 greece does not have folk music and it does not have folklore
7146921 folk music is by definition irish pop music specifically irish pop music influenced by eastern european dance music
7146922 rave and trance on technical grounds should be classified as classical
7146923 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
7146924 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

7146982 weve got to look at our competition our national hockey league as it is soft i think our club scene is far too soft its accommodating to mediocre players

7146991 now the town is calm but we are still skeptical about the situation
7146992 the possibility of the defeated militia or any other troops challenging the islamic militia who are now in control of kismayo is not simple or realistic

7146999 obama from the crowd in springfield illinois and a rueful smile from the vp hopeful
7147000 it isnt like there was a staff meeting to say this is the person we were all signed up for the text messages like you one of the aides said
7147001 obama biden banners made their debut in springfield as the 35 000 strong crowd gave a rapturous welcome to the two democrats standing on the same steps where senator obama launched his white house quest back in february 2007

7147008 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7147009 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7147010 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7147011 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7147012 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board
7147013 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama

7147148 now more than ever we need to end unfair and deceptive credit card lending practices that make it difficult for consumers to control their credit and manage their debt maloney said
7147149 instead of teasing people with low introductory rates giving cards to anyone who breathes and then hitting them with fees and penalties on the back end lenders can still price for risk they just have to do it on the front end susswein said

7147154 the battle between greed and fear is involved in all investing
7147155 there is a little more greed in the guys and a little more fear in the girls
7147156 men are more willing to make decisions without studying them
7147157 they also feel like they can beat up the market on the other hand when women get involved they are more diligent workers they study they talk they learn they dont have the urge to beat the market
7147158 its the overtrading that causes men to have lower returns

7147182 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7147183 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7147184 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

7147192 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

7147202 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7147203 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7147204 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7147205 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7147206 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board
7147207 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama
7147208 all the other pageantry is essentially endorsements by people who want to get him elected
7147209 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7147210 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7147211 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7147212 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7147213 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7147214 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7147215 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7147216 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7147217 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7147218 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7147219 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7147220 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7147221 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7147222 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7147223 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7147224 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7147225 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche

7147227 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7147228 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7147229 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7147230 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7147231 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

7147237 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7147238 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7147239 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7147240 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7147241 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7147242 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

7147245 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7147246 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7147247 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
7147248 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7147249 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7147250 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7147251 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7147252 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7147253 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7147254 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7147255 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
7147256 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
7147257 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
7147258 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
7147259 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
7147260 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
7147261 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
7147262 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
7147263 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
7147264 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
7147265 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
7147266 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
7147267 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
7147268 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
7147269 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
7147270 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
7147271 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
7147272 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
7147273 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
7147274 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7147275 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7147276 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7147277 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7147278 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7147279 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7147280 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7147281 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7147282 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7147283 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7147284 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7147285 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7147286 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7147287 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7147288 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7147289 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7147290 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7147291 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7147292 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7147293 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7147294 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7147295 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7147296 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7147297 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7147298 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7147299 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7147300 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7147301 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7147302 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7147303 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7147304 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7147305 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7147306 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7147307 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7147308 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7147309 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7147310 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7147311 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7147312 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7147313 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7147314 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7147315 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7147316 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7147317 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7147318 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7147319 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7147320 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7147321 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7147322 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7147323 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7147324 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7147325 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7147326 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7147327 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7147328 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7147329 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7147330 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7147331 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7147332 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7147333 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7147334 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7147335 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7147336 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7147337 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7147338 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7147339 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7147340 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7147341 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7147342 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7147343 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7147344 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7147345 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7147346 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7147347 set aside that obama said shed be on anybodys short list set aside anybodys feelings on whether she was deliberately snubbed and the pros and cons of whether it should be her
7147348 focus on the politics of it and you have about a quarter of clinton loyalists still not joining the caravan for gods sake not to even make a show of taking her seriously is flatly stupid
7147349 you cant put obama vp vetters eric holder and caroline kennedy on an hour plane ride to chappaqua just to check the box they should have done it just for the optics
7147350 barack never even said to her heres how i envision the job not one discussion with her about the position
7147351 part of what makes the game great is the judgment of the umpires
7147352 i hope not but i think youre kind of opening pandoras box when you start allowing replays and how theyll leak into other aspects of the game like safe or out calls and eventually balls and strikes
7147353 the umpires are out there for a reason and the reason is their judgment thats the fun of the game its funny how theyve come up with all these rules about speeding up the game meanwhile this will pretty much put a halt to the game
7147354 its different between innings but when youre out there on the mound youre in game mode then all of a sudden youre supposed to take a break i dont know how it will go i dont know what im going to do
7147355 hopefully theyll have a system where it will be done quickly
7147356 we need a spot filled so were calling somebody up to fill that spot

7147360 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
7147361 america was never innocent we popped our cherry on the boat over and looked back with no regrets you cant ascribe our fall from grace to any single event or set of circumstances you cant lose what you lacked at conception
7147362 mass market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed hagiography sanctifies shuck and jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight

7147388 el periodismo ha dejado de ser un club cerrado donde unos cuantos daban lecciones a los dem s hemos ganado en democracia

7147396 without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
7147397 establishing check points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7147398 may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of south ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of georgian territory
7147399 inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included
7147400 so the russian side has complied with the agreements recorded in moscows medvedev sarkozy principles
7147401 there is a chance of escalation over the black sea feet

7147404 the blackmail cases are usually via telephone calls letters and even husbands threatening their wives during domestics arguments
7147405 many tested positive during routine urine tests conducted by the police therefore all agencies should join forces and double their efforts to curb this illegal activity
7147406 i also hope more non governmental organisations and the public help the police in fighting crime
7147407 i feel they should know about the plight of children in poor countries and learn not to waste money on things we dont really need and to be grateful for what we have as we are actually very lucky
7147408 however they are very supportive as they know i am here for the experience
7147409 last year 5 000 people participated in the programme but this year because we have decentralised the event 9 500 people are participating
7147410 this is the 11th year the annual world vision 30 hour famine has taken place in the country and despite high inflation we feel very encouraged as malaysians still contribute despite having to adapt their lifestyle
7147411 we have so much so that sometimes we forget we must never forget that it is our moral duty to help others

7147413 most of the players were picked at random from the various state teams over the last three weeks
7147414 as such we cannot expect too much from them we have to be realistic of our chances as this is the first time we are competing in such a tournament
7147415 i praise and thank god that we have achieved a double treble the players worked hard and i am very proud of them this win is dedicated to sultan of kedah and fans who travelled all the way to support us
7147416 we tried our best and we lost to a team that took their chances well and i have always said in football we need to take our chances creating alone is not good enough
7147417 but i am proud of my players and we want to thank the fans who came out to support us today

7147424 the area has been in and out of drought since the start of the decade mostly in
7147425 but fall of last year was when it really started to get bad in some places this year has been as dry or even drier than the dust bowl
7147426 any rain that falls is sapped by evaporation in two or three days four feet down there is literally no moisture left in the soil recently we were digging as part of a project to decommission a county well and we dug down to a depth of 7 feet and there was still no moisture even irrigation cant offset these deficits
7147427 misguided sycophants who pretend to be loyalists of governor oserhiemen osunbor
7147428 as far as the party is concerned in the state there is no such move or ploy to impeach the governor as there was no meeting either openly or secretly where such suggestions or moves were made rather the party is embarking on massive registration of new entrants into its fold in edo state
7147429 chief tony anenih and the entire leadership of the party in the state have been concerned with peace progress and socio political advancement of the pdp as a party and how to deliver democratic dividends to the people of the state those who are sponsoring such mischievous and baseless allegations are only looking for a way to siphon from the governor of the state under the pretence that they are fighting his political cause
7147430 be wary of such political miscreants and charlatans who parade government house everyday trying to create tension and anxiety among the people of the state

7147435 common depression makes it impossible for sufferers to enjoy themselves to the point they cant even form a smile on their face
7147436 medically speaking there is no term for this new type of depression thats something that the media is talking about but one reason for that might be that diagnostic standards in the world of psychiatric medicine are in transition while depression is taking on wider and wider definitions

7147445 we have seen what the chinese have done and im sure well better them without a doubt
7147446 there was obviously a lot of negativity leading up to the competition but everyone knew that once the games actually started that would disappear and the success of the teams and the athletes would take over
7147447 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7147448 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that

7147495 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7147496 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7147497 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7147498 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him

7147503 i stood in the field tonight and had one goal in my mind that was to win a gold medal
7147504 i wanted to perform well throughout the game but at the end of the ninth inning i felt a little bit nervous
7147505 punch my balls just like punch the living shit out of them
7147506 level 1 tech support operator no degree no training possibly solve
7147507 solve problems to the best of my ability read pay rate
7147508 if a modem didnt have line sync would we see authentication attempts packets
7147509 if the lamp is plugged into the power but the lightbulb isnt screwed in will you see light come out
7147510 the man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers
7147511 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7147512 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7147513 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7147514 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7147515 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7147516 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7147517 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7147518 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7147519 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7147520 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7147521 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7147522 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7147523 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7147524 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7147525 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7147526 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7147527 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7147528 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7147529 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7147530 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7147531 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7147532 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7147533 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7147534 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7147535 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7147536 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7147537 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7147538 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7147539 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7147540 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7147541 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7147542 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7147543 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7147544 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7147545 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7147546 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7147547 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7147548 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7147549 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7147550 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7147551 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7147552 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7147553 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7147554 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7147555 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7147556 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7147557 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7147558 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7147559 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7147560 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7147561 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7147562 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7147563 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7147564 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7147565 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7147566 this is a planning took where all things are going
7147567 les bombes sous munitions tuent civils et enfants bien apr s la fin des guerres et cette semaine nous avons loccasion de les bannir
7147568 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7147569 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7147570 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7147571 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7147572 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7147573 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7147574 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7147575 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7147576 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7147577 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7147578 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7147579 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7147580 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7147581 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7147582 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7147583 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7147584 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7147585 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7147586 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7147587 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7147588 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7147589 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7147590 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7147591 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7147592 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7147593 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7147594 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7147595 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7147596 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7147597 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7147598 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7147599 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7147600 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7147601 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7147602 i hit myself in the mouth with my baseball bat
7147603 even though it hurt hitting myself with a bat will make me a scarier mummy
7147604 i am going to see mr massage so i am wearing comfortable clothes
7147605 en fait la raison d tre de toute la cr ation tait de servir

7147610 john mccain is a dangerously hot headed celebrity pow who cant remember how many houses he owns
7147611 its not personal dammit stop planting deer food and they wont come
7147612 tim ill have to let you go weve got another deer emergency
7147613 shes not dead shes probably just resting and im fairly certain there is no fawn
7147614 i may not have been raised on a farm but im
7147615 that deer is as dead as you can get and her fawn is over there on the other side of our creek
7147616 well have to approach very quietly or we might scare it
7147617 listen if that doe died after giving birth she probably was too old or too sick to survive it that might mean she wasnt able to feed this little thing either and thats not good if animal services cant get any milk into her she wont make it
7147618 sadly the reason we cant do this as well inside our own species is because there are those who would as soon call you crazy as be touched by your experience
7147619 the ability to look at our enemy or what we think is our enemy and see ourselves people animals that just want what we do
7147620 i didnt know lavender was a greek flower good to know
7147621 john mccain is a dangerously hot headed celebrity pow who cant remember how many houses he owns

7147623 our bats woke up brett anderson pitched a great ball game
7147624 i stood in the field tonight and had one goal in my mind that was to win a gold medal
7147625 i wanted to perform well throughout the game but at the end of the ninth inning i felt a little bit nervous
7147626 now their appetite has become so good they eat twice as much and theyre putting on weight
7147627 staggering dreams sobering visions oh god let me soar under eagles wings
7147628 i had a verbal agreement with the editor of a startup magazine to write a monthly column
7147629 masalah urusan saya pribadi itu menjadi urusan pribadi sendri juga
7147630 the idea of setting up a team for the tour has always been conceptual
7147631 but now its a proper plan with the mission to win the tour with a clean drug free british rider our mentality would be the same as with the track its all or nothing the aim is to start in 2010
7147632 my view at the time was that mens professional road cycling was almost completely dominated by an underlying drug culture in the context of the programme i was charged with creating having a drug system or even a tolerance of a drug system just wasnt an option
7147633 its a hell of a project but if i thought it was impossible i wouldnt be progressing with it
7147634 as with the track programme wed set out to win and well be selling it to sponsors on that basis with the ambition of winning the tour
7147635 it was always a question of having the critical mass of riders but its looking more do able now we have the talent coming through ive no doubts about that
7147636 if my profile is higher then i would hope it can benefit not just me but my sport i feel passionately about promoting cycling its a great sport and from mark cavendishs success on the tour de france to our medals here in beijing i can sense a real feelgood factor
7147637 hopefully that means more people will ride bikes from kids cycling to school to people riding to work to those racing in many ways im just as passionate about people riding bikes for fun for me cycling isnt all about racing
7147638 glad to know that we managed to deliver 150 additional officers by the end of the previous financial year the government is on the case and is delivering
7147639 we are increasing police presence on our streets with 150 additional officers recruited in our first year
7147640 where are these phantom police officers have they ever existed or did they simply disappear into the bermuda triangle along with the rest of the snps election pledges
7147641 we expect the first minister to make a statement to msps explaining why he has apparently misled parliament or perhaps he would rather that kenny macaskill face the music after all both of them have made the same claim that they paid for and recruited 150 new officers
7147642 we undertook to deliver 150 additional officers in 2007 8 and that is what we did the number of officers recruited by the forces themselves and decisions on how many to recruit are strictly a matter for individual chief constables
7147643 we didnt need half as many recruits that we thought at first we also took six transferees from other forces which allows us to get officers on the beat a lot quicker they are new officers to us
7147644 some applicants will not complete this rigorous process hence the number of probationary officers who end up attending the college may be lower than projected
7147645 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate
7147646 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
7147647 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7147648 the grant of significant sums of public money to an apparently unincorporated association is unusual to say the least could the launch of the foundation not have been postponed until the legal formalities were complete
7147649 every week brings new and troubling details about the unorthodox funding given to the sif we are coming up for two months since parliamentary questions were first asked about this and we have so far had no answers this is an uncharacteristic silence from mr salmond and his crowd
7147650 there have been a number of parliamentary questions tabled which will be answered comprehensively and will demonstrate that all funding decisions were properly made
7147651 unfortunately the article by stephen maxwell is based on press reports which contain inaccurate information
7147652 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they georgian forces will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7147653 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7147654 russia has begun its withdrawal from georgia but not completed it
7147655 while we are still alive we will not allow them to stay here
7147656 these are not just efficiency savings but real cuts to the health service totalling over 85m i am very concerned that patient care will suffer as a result if nicola sturgeon doesnt want to be branded the minister for health cuts she must make the nhs a genuine priority for the snp and find the money to fund it properly
7147657 if these children need me in days of sunshine how much more do they need me in days of darkness
7147658 i have come to admire her so much that i want as many people as possible to know about her i am aghast that more people dont know her story
7147659 there is not much to report here even here on the way to heaven there are mountains but further away than ours
7147660 we will take a london approach and will be different our approach is to keep it simple and creative to make it youthful and diverse entertaining and fun it will be london uk loud and proud
7147661 i can genuinely say i did not feel a sense of nervousness that we had to follow that because london brings other things and it will be a different place and a different time
7147662 we decided to go for a short sharp shock something contemporary that celebrates everything that london is
7147663 we are not going to win over everybody but it is something that will appeal both to younger generations and to more mature generations such as myself
7147664 i just love the version of whole lotta love that he and leona lewis have done
7147665 we have been respectful when we have needed to be and i believe this will really show what we can do in london with the talent we have
7147666 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it we will have to see what other issues were present
7147667 he would bring to any administration a tremendous credibility and talent
7147668 the history of the james tait black is stunning im very gratified and honoured im also rather touched our horses in egypt is after all resolutely equine
7147669 i first heard of this award not as a writer but as a reader where i found it set like a seal on everything i most admired in biography it has become a gold standard and i am thrilled and very honoured to have won it
7147670 two books shone for their readability rosalind belbens novel was innovatively plotted and convincingly executed while rosemary hills first book is a biography that does justice to the many facets of the man augustus pugin and his work
7147671 we will publish our legislative programme when parliament returns and of course will look at ideas from wherever they come in the parliament
7147672 of course all opposition parties have to understand that in a fixed budget parliament any extra spending in one area has to come from somewhere else and they need to have the maturity to spell out these changes
7147673 this initiative would mean that every pupil in year groups p7 s3 should be entitled to a weeks residential course in outdoor education
7147674 education in an outdoor environment provides one of the most valuable and rewarding learning experiences for a wide range of pupils regardless of background or ability
7147675 i firmly believe this would enrich the lives of the pupils helping them to build confidence and self esteem
7147676 in particular these activities teach pupils leadership skills the need for responsible behaviour and how to deal with new challenges and risk factors
7147677 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7147678 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic yeah
7147679 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7147680 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off
7147681 even william hartnell who played the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines i think hell always probably tend to be around 40
7147682 marriage will be recognised in the tax system if i am davids chancellor which i fully expect to be then i will implement that
7147683 there is no disagreement there at all of course everyone is entitled to choose how to live their lives and some marriages do fail but we know that in general marriage is an institution that contributes to building a stronger society
7147684 that is why labour was wrong to stop supporting it through the tax system
7147685 but on the big fundamentals the changes necessary to the conservative party keeping the conservative party on the centre ground in british politics and the economic changes that we need to make we pretty much see eye to eye
7147686 the submarine operator got the fright of his life he was quietly going about his job when this monster came out of nowhere swam across the camera and then was gone into the dark
7147687 great whites can actually survive better in cold waters than other sharks
7147688 its almost definitely a porbeagle shark because of the white flashes on the trailing edge of the dorsal fin great whites dont have such a distinctive mark whereas porbeagles do
7147689 its a uk resident shark species and you get them all round the uk coast
7147690 this behaviour is much more typical of a porbeagle shark
7147691 they are inquisitive fish and it has come along to look at whats going on and it has flown off again
7147692 i think when people are looking at the olympics in 2012 britain home of football where football was invented which we gave to the world i think people would be very surprised if there is an olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it
7147693 we are absolutely opposed to team gb we think it will threaten the independent status of the home nations
7147694 i think gordon brown should be running the country not sticking his nose in places where its not wanted

7147703 cuma karena saya sudah sarjana kerja di luar negeri pula jadi saya mencoba meramu ungkapan perasaan saya dengan cara yang lebih elegan berpendidikan dan berkelas halahh saya baca di sebuah blog mantan dosen saya kalau rasa tertarik kita terhadap seseorang itu seringkali muncul karena perbedaan yang kontras we seldom have interest with our type buat saya sedikit banyak ada benarnya saya seorang kutu buku introvert yang mencoba gaul lebih sering tertarik kepada seorang yang naturally memang gaul entahkah karena bertemu orang demikian saya merasa kelemahan saya di komplemen atau memang sudah nature manusia untuk punya ketertarikan komplemen seperti ini sekali waktu di bandung dulu sehabis bermain badminton dengan rekan2 pigivora kita main ke rumah ando dan bertemu dengan rekan rekan band adik ando yang baru pulang dari rekaman di studio mereka merekam satu lagu rohani untuk diikutkan dalam perlombaan cipta lagu rohani oleh radio maestro bandung vokalis mereka adalah seorang cewe yang kuliah di salah satu perguruan tinggi swasta di bandung waktu itu ada acara kumpul kumpul dan gadis ini menyanyikan lagu rekaman mereka suaranya bagus dan merdu lalu saya berpikir dalam hati
7147704 kalau ditanya cocok aku cocok sama dia kalau ditanya sayang aku sayang sama dia kalau ditanya baik dia baik
7147705 mudah mudahan dia randy bisa dapet yang terbaik entah dia dapet yang lain atau balik lagi sama aku
7147706 er freut sich jedesmal wenn wir laufen gehen figo ist oft schneller als ich da hab ich probleme mit ihm mitzuhalten
7147707 der start war etwas schwierig figo war wegen der anderen hunde etwas unruhig aber nach cirka zwei kilometer hat er ordentlich gas gegeben und mich gezogen nat rlich taugt uns der sieg wir hatten harte konkurrenz jetzt freu ich mich umso mehr auf den halbmarathon am sonntag
7147708 ich werde versuchen mit den deutschen topl ufern auf den ersten 15 kilometern eine gruppe zu bilden dann ist sicherlich eine gute zeit drinnen
7147709 die strecke ist durchgehend wellig eine gro e herausforderung f r die l ufer schon vom start weg bis zum casino velden geht es immer leicht hinauf deshalb sollte man die ersten 500 meter bis zum casino noch dosiert angehen ansonsten kann man konstant hohes tempo laufen von den beiden steileren anstiegen auf der strecke abgesehen die letzten kilometer ab krumpendorf sind dann sch n flach
7147710 deshalb musst die strecke schon im vorfeld genau studieren und dir eine gute taktik zurechtlegen
7147711 die erste vorentscheidung f llt meistens vor dem strandbad saag n he p rtschach anm da gibt es einen 500 meter langen anstieg bis hin zum bahnschranken wenn du hier richtig attackierst und vorne wegkommst bist du kaum mehr einzuholen
7147712 da kannst du gut beobachten wer von deinen konkurrenten wo steht und was noch m glich ist
7147713 ich bin mir sicher dass die afrikanischen l ufer vorne dabei sein werden aber du kannst nicht genau absch tzen wer von den l ufern gerade am besten in form ist ich glaube jedenfalls nicht dass es der stanley salil zum dritten mal packen wird mein bauchgef hl sagt es mir
7147714 man l sst sich von den zuschauern inspirieren es gibt sehr viel unterhaltung auf der strecke da ist der laufgenuss schon sehr gro

7147719 your face you look like something bad has happened like you feel really lost
7147720 about five or six years ago i got into smokin dope then it was cocaine and meth my husband left me then he went to court and took my kids away

7147758 if abc has to tell the white house you can bet its not rove libby or cheney being indicted

7147909 we see the adoption of the fla by kde as a positive and important milestone in the maturity of the free software community
7147910 the fla was designed to help projects increase the legal maintainability of their software to ensure long term protection and reliability kde is among the most important free software initiatives and it is playing a central role in bringing freedom to the desktop this decision of the kde project underlines its dedication to think about how to make that freedom last
7147911 kde e v has endorsed the use of a particular fla based directly on the fsfes sample fla as the preferred way to assign copyright to the association we recognise that assignment is an option that individuals may wish to exercise it is in no way pushed upon kde contributors there are also other avenues of copyright assignment available besides the fla but we believe this is the easiest way to get it done with little fuss enthusiasm for the fla was immediate people were asking for printed versions of the form before the week was out so that they could fill one in
7147912 the fla is a versatile document designed to work across different countries with different perceptions of copyright and authorship
7147913 as a truly international project kde provides a great example of how the fla can provide legal coherency in the mid to long term its been a pleasure to help with the adoption process and fsfes freedom task force is ready to continuing supporting kde in the future

7147966 when i announced this policy the other day sen obama wasted no time in mischaracterizing it he described my position as you guessed it another example of bushs third term
7147967 i guess the senator has changed his position since voting for the 2005 bush energy bill a grab bag of corporate handouts that i opposed come to think of it that energy bill was the only time weve ever seen sen obama vote in favor of any tax break and it was a tax break for the oil companies

7147971 this is bullshit this is malarkey this is outrageous outrageous for the president of the united states to go to a foreign country sit in the knesset and make this kind of ridiculous statement
7147972 this is the same president who talks about appeasement the same one who asks me to get on a plane and talk to qaddafi
7147973 the same president who made a deal with qaddafi he writes letters dear mr chairman to kim jong il
7147974 we should take zero backseat to this pres talking about appeasement under him israel is less safe
7147975 thats pretty damn good stuff and check out the idea that john mccain and joe lieberman are going to eliminate any vestige of iranian influence in iraq bless me father for i have sinned are they unaware of a border that has existed there for millennium are they unaware of the fact that our guy maliki is inviting ahmadinejad to baghdad and kissing him on both cheeks literally not figuratively are they unaware of the fact that this government in iraq feels compelled to visit tehran to explain what it is that they are attempting to do with a long term security agreement every single person out there that is of any consequence knows the vice president doesnt know what hes talking about i cant be more blunt than that
7147976 he is yet to be right one single time on iraq
7147977 i think the first thing that comes to mind is just pride incredible pride that we have a syracuse alum who is a heartbeat away from the highest office in the land and not just because its a syracuse alum but its joe biden someone of his caliber experience in government hes a household name

7148001 im not a young man anymore im retired now but i sometimes think that all the things in my life that have made it worth the living have been as a result of my connection to the dead gentleman
7148002 it is only in the past 10 years we have started to understand these differences and it remains an under researched area but even the knowledge we have has not filtered down and the average gp has no idea that drugs such as paracetamol and morphine work differently in women
7148003 our preliminary data suggests there are long term health consequences of not taking monthly period pain seriously the images show increased activity in different brain regions which suggests untreated pain permanently changes the brain and central nervous system this could explain why multiple painful conditions are much more common in women
7148004 the next stage for us it to find out whether these changes are permanent or if this is recoverable when the pain is treated properly
7148005 better access to multidisciplinary pain services is essential for these women the economic and social benefits for society are clear
7148006 at first i presumed the pain would eventually go away and i would get better i didnt expect to develop chronic pain or that it would stop me working and lead me to consider suicide my problems have arisen from a combination of an initial misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatments im taking 20 tablets every day but still some days i cant get up i just want my life back

7148025 mccains world is a brighter simpler world but its not the one the rest of us live in
7148026 we havent played good defense for the most part because weve had injured players
7148027 i think thats the biggest reason why we havent played that type of football
7148028 i am not going to panic because i know our potential but maybe its the fact that a lot of us are trying to pace ourselves and thats myself too
7148029 its difficult the older you get you go out in a game and know none of this stuff matters but you still have to play full speed and play hard
7148030 we want to be a dominant defense and we think we are we talk about it
7148031 but talking about it and doing it are two different things if we play the way we did thursday night were going to be where we were last year

7148046 i think we have to make it easier to vote and im assuming that why tuesday is in favor of for example of having it on weekends so that more people can vote
7148047 my view is i dont see any strong evidence that having election day on a weekend is going to increase turnout relative to tuesday if i saw any data to suggest that it would create a larger turnout then i would support that whatever it took
7148048 a study in 2000 suggested that weekend voting increases turnout rates far above statistical relevance

7148060 his working class background will connect to the voters who are still unsure of obama and his way with words will absolutely demolish
7148061 all of these factors and oh so many others will help obama on election day because he isnt afraid to speak his mind and hell have attacked mccain so hard by then that the voters will know the truth about obama and the truth about mccain that obama is our countrys only hope for change our only hope for an america we can all be proud of an america the rest of the world admires and respects

7148126 sometimes we get the impression that america does not need friends
7148127 i dont believe these are misconceptions i think this is a purposeful attempt by some to create an image of russia based on which one could influence our internal and foreign policies this is the reason why everybody is made to believe russians are a little bit savage still or they just climbed down from the trees you know and probably need to have the dirt washed out of their beards and hair

7148155 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7148156 for a campaign built around aspirational rhetoric this is an uninspiring decision the selection of joe biden emphasizes barak obamas lack of experience and undermines the chance of any real change in our nations capitol barack obama is trying to compensate for an area of weakness that even prompted criticism from his new running mate
7148157 i was surprised by senator obamas choice of senator joe biden it demonstrates that the obama campaign realizes that senator obama doesnt have the foreign policy credentials or experience to be president theres no other reason besides that to add senator biden to the ticket joe biden undermines the message of change and otherwise adds nothing to the democratic ticket hes a left liberal blue state democrat with no executive experience just like senator obama himself the decision gives further reason to wonder whether senator obama has the judgment we need in a president
7148158 you literally could make an object of any imaginable shape or design an object of any imaginable shape and simply hit the print command and the matter would take that shape

7148184 thats why most of my cars have turbos theyre just that much more fun to drive
7148185 thats what this type of racing was all about back in the day
7148186 its going to be awesome hopefully well be in good shape it will be fun
7148187 theyre going to change the cars too so it will be a big challenge
7148188 i dont know what else will change but im sure that wont be all and for those of us who have gotten used to naturally aspirated engines it will be a major difference were going to have to get used to it again
7148189 you can say it was a short week you can say what you want but im not that type of guy
7148190 i completely take the burden for his loss i didnt execute and i didnt get in a rhythm to let the team drive down the field
7148191 when i got to daylight i saw receivers blocking and dan was out there
7148192 dan really took two and then i kind of weaved and dove over the top
7148193 thats how the running game is its 2 3 negative 2 nothing then all the sudden the big one hits
7148194 the running game is like that boxing match where a guy keeps hitting a guy in the body and it doesnt look like much early but later on they get tired of getting hit in the body and they let their guard down
7148195 i want to take the legs out of them so they cant rush
7148196 then theyll defend it then we have a chance to use the big guys outside
7148197 if theyre not rooting for the home team what are they doing here
7148198 its expected maybe if i was a lion id be a little disappointed
7148199 some guys will talk about the guys who didnt make the trip and did not play
7148200 but they had guys who did not play as well so you cant use that as an excuse
7148201 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
7148202 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy
7148203 then these righteous ones will reply lord when did we ever see you hungry and feed you
7148204 and the king will say i tell you the truth when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters
7148205 all those kinds acts dont count unless unless you shoved me down their throat with prideful arrogance
7148206 only one national flag was raised to the ceiling it was red with five stars this is almost miraculous a perfect ending to the 2008 beijing olympics
7148207 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7148208 we have seen what the chinese have done and im sure well better them without a doubt
7148209 there was obviously a lot of negativity leading up to the competition but everyone knew that once the games actually started that would disappear and the success of the teams and the athletes would take over

7148359 if its going to be the subject of such concern and such forgive me for saying a huge over reaction a little bit of the kill joy taking some fun out of something i think we should adopt the oliver cromwell puritan streak and withdraw it

7148366 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the us of america joe biden
7148367 my friends i dont have to tell you this election year the choice is clear one man stands ready to deliver change we desperately need a man im proud to call my friend a man who will be the next president of the united states barack america
7148368 as an 18 1 2 year veteran i should have known better
7148369 glad to know that we managed to deliver 150 additional officers by the end of the previous financial year the government is on the case and is delivering
7148370 we are increasing police presence on our streets with 150 additional officers recruited in our first year
7148371 where are these phantom police officers have they ever existed or did they simply disappear into the bermuda triangle along with the rest of the snps election pledges
7148372 we expect the first minister to make a statement to msps explaining why he has apparently misled parliament or perhaps he would rather that kenny macaskill face the music after all both of them have made the same claim that they paid for and recruited 150 new officers
7148373 we undertook to deliver 150 additional officers in 2007 8 and that is what we did the number of officers recruited by the forces themselves and decisions on how many to recruit are strictly a matter for individual chief constables
7148374 we didnt need half as many recruits that we thought at first we also took six transferees from other forces which allows us to get officers on the beat a lot quicker they are new officers to us
7148375 some applicants will not complete this rigorous process hence the number of probationary officers who end up attending the college may be lower than projected
7148376 if these children need me in days of sunshine how much more do they need me in days of darkness

7148380 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7148381 russia has begun its withdrawal from georgia but not completed it

7148383 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate
7148384 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
7148385 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7148386 the grant of significant sums of public money to an apparently unincorporated association is unusual to say the least could the launch of the foundation not have been postponed until the legal formalities were complete
7148387 every week brings new and troubling details about the unorthodox funding given to the sif we are coming up for two months since parliamentary questions were first asked about this and we have so far had no answers this is an uncharacteristic silence from mr salmond and his crowd
7148388 there have been a number of parliamentary questions tabled which will be answered comprehensively and will demonstrate that all funding decisions were properly made
7148389 unfortunately the article by stephen maxwell is based on press reports which contain inaccurate information
7148390 we will take a london approach and will be different our approach is to keep it simple and creative to make it youthful and diverse entertaining and fun it will be london uk loud and proud
7148391 i can genuinely say i did not feel a sense of nervousness that we had to follow that because london brings other things and it will be a different place and a different time
7148392 we decided to go for a short sharp shock something contemporary that celebrates everything that london is
7148393 we are not going to win over everybody but it is something that will appeal both to younger generations and to more mature generations such as myself
7148394 i just love the version of whole lotta love that he and leona lewis have done
7148395 we have been respectful when we have needed to be and i believe this will really show what we can do in london with the talent we have
7148396 we will publish our legislative programme when parliament returns and of course will look at ideas from wherever they come in the parliament
7148397 of course all opposition parties have to understand that in a fixed budget parliament any extra spending in one area has to come from somewhere else and they need to have the maturity to spell out these changes
7148398 this initiative would mean that every pupil in year groups p7 s3 should be entitled to a weeks residential course in outdoor education
7148399 education in an outdoor environment provides one of the most valuable and rewarding learning experiences for a wide range of pupils regardless of background or ability
7148400 i firmly believe this would enrich the lives of the pupils helping them to build confidence and self esteem
7148401 in particular these activities teach pupils leadership skills the need for responsible behaviour and how to deal with new challenges and risk factors
7148402 he would bring to any administration a tremendous credibility and talent
7148403 these are not just efficiency savings but real cuts to the health service totalling over 85m i am very concerned that patient care will suffer as a result if nicola sturgeon doesnt want to be branded the minister for health cuts she must make the nhs a genuine priority for the snp and find the money to fund it properly
7148404 the idea of setting up a team for the tour has always been conceptual
7148405 but now its a proper plan with the mission to win the tour with a clean drug free british rider our mentality would be the same as with the track its all or nothing the aim is to start in 2010
7148406 my view at the time was that mens professional road cycling was almost completely dominated by an underlying drug culture in the context of the programme i was charged with creating having a drug system or even a tolerance of a drug system just wasnt an option
7148407 its a hell of a project but if i thought it was impossible i wouldnt be progressing with it
7148408 as with the track programme wed set out to win and well be selling it to sponsors on that basis with the ambition of winning the tour
7148409 it was always a question of having the critical mass of riders but its looking more do able now we have the talent coming through ive no doubts about that
7148410 if my profile is higher then i would hope it can benefit not just me but my sport i feel passionately about promoting cycling its a great sport and from mark cavendishs success on the tour de france to our medals here in beijing i can sense a real feelgood factor
7148411 hopefully that means more people will ride bikes from kids cycling to school to people riding to work to those racing in many ways im just as passionate about people riding bikes for fun for me cycling isnt all about racing
7148412 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it we will have to see what other issues were present
7148413 work turn to the left work now turn to the right work sashay shante
7148414 marriage will be recognised in the tax system if i am davids chancellor which i fully expect to be then i will implement that
7148415 there is no disagreement there at all of course everyone is entitled to choose how to live their lives and some marriages do fail but we know that in general marriage is an institution that contributes to building a stronger society
7148416 that is why labour was wrong to stop supporting it through the tax system
7148417 but on the big fundamentals the changes necessary to the conservative party keeping the conservative party on the centre ground in british politics and the economic changes that we need to make we pretty much see eye to eye
7148418 i think when people are looking at the olympics in 2012 britain home of football where football was invented which we gave to the world i think people would be very surprised if there is an olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it
7148419 we are absolutely opposed to team gb we think it will threaten the independent status of the home nations

7148422 great whites can actually survive better in cold waters than other sharks

7148424 its a uk resident shark species and you get them all round the uk coast
7148425 this behaviour is much more typical of a porbeagle shark

7148431 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic yeah
7148432 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7148433 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off

7148439 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7148440 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7148441 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7148442 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7148443 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7148444 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7148445 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7148446 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on climate change

7148452 he has always been a friend to the underdog said obama
7148453 he looked former serbian leader slobodan milosevic in the eye and called him a war criminal joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman
7148454 hes brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him said obama a pre emptive answer to inevitable concerns that a consummate insider like biden doesnt fit with obamas mantra of change
7148455 we cannot as a nation stand four more years of this biden said to enthusiastic cheers from rally goers who stood for hours in 90 degree heat to witness the unveiling of the ticket
7148456 barack and i come from very different places but we share a common story said biden recounting how obama was raised by a single mother and how both men were poor at times in their childhoods
7148457 the next president before quickly demoting him back to running mate status
7148458 house divided speech obama supporters who first learned of the choice of biden hours earlier through news reports or text messages from the campaign appeared to generally supportive
7148459 biden is the bulldog we need said sharon hoffmann of st louis who traveled to springfield for the event
7148460 biden had a lot of criticism of obama in the primary race noted rally goer shane mills also of st

7148469 what in the world was the zoo doing allowing a female to breed
7148470 the post may be deaf to complaints about overheated rhetoric and insults to a civil rights hero but the plagiarism and quote fabrication charges cant be ignored
7148471 let alone the fact that your ethically challenged behavior is abhorrent to anyone who writes for a living regardless of their political stripes
7148472 i completely agree about the need to respect moral values if these charges are as well founded as they seem to be it will be interesting to see whether ben domenech has the guts to apply these principles to his own case or whether he deploys morality only against other people

7148485 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

7148511 my psyche and mentality is pretty much fixed on im the greatest race car driver to ever live
7148512 if you dont believe that you dont belong in a race car
7148513 i feel a little lonely in the decisions i have to make on many subjects at many different times
7148514 but carl demonstrated to me and as david ragan does and as matt kenseth did before him and greg biffle did that hes going to be as good in this business as anybody ive ever known
7148515 and hes going to stay there for a long time so i was right in recognizing he had potential and very quickly after he won his first race i told him ill stay in the business as long as you drive these cars i hope that ive got job security for a long time now on account of that
7148516 were getting to the point i feel personally that we can win at any racetrack we go to
7148517 im guardedly optimistic that well be able to put four cars in the chase
7148518 that wont be the same as when we put five in but carl based on the way that the structure of the chase is will be in better shape than any of the other guys can be
7148519 my aunt and uncle who i had not seen in four or five years came out and walked around today thats what its all about
7148520 hoje tivemos atitude e sa mos de cabe a erguida bem diferente da derrota para o coritiba eles fizeram o que eu tinha pedido durante esses dias tivemos um bom volume de jogo mas n o conseguimos fazer o gol o problema que deu tudo certo para o advers rio

7148523 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure
7148524 ol que b rbara venceste a todas com v rios pontos portanto n o sabes o qu o contentes estamos todos e claro muito emocionados
7148525 i knew i needed a break and he gave it to me all i can do is force him to run hard and he made a mistake im lucky
7148526 i just got loose down there and made a mistake and gave it away
7148527 the state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation
7148528 you have the power to make a united states senator
7148529 freudian slip that it said betrayed the 47 year old senator obamas unreadiness to serve as commander in chief
7148530 obama from the crowd in springfield illinois and a rueful smile from the vp hopeful
7148531 it isnt like there was a staff meeting to say this is the person we were all signed up for the text messages like you one of the aides said
7148532 obama biden banners made their debut in springfield as the 35 000 strong crowd gave a rapturous welcome to the two democrats standing on the same steps where senator obama launched his white house quest back in february 2007
7148533 i think obama could not have made a better choice
7148534 i talked to some around town this morning and were pleased
7148535 i think this is a non controversial choice and so democrats are very enthusiastic and biden is just going to strengthen the ticket
7148536 ive been seeing some really great doctors over the past few days and theyve all said the same things about the injury theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point playing this year is first and foremost thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7148537 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7148538 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7148539 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7148540 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
7148541 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
7148542 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7148543 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7148544 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7148545 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7148546 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7148547 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7148548 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7148549 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7148550 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7148551 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7148552 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7148553 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7148554 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7148555 for the first time in my adult life i am really proud of my country
7148556 jesse jackson won south carolina in 84 and 88 jackson ran a good campaign and obama ran a good campaign here
7148557 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
7148558 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7148559 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7148560 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7148561 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7148562 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7148563 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7148564 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7148565 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7148566 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7148567 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7148568 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills

7148570 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7148571 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7148572 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7148573 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7148574 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7148575 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7148576 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7148577 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7148578 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7148579 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7148580 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7148581 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7148582 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7148583 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7148584 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7148585 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7148586 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7148587 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7148588 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7148589 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7148590 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7148591 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7148592 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7148593 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7148594 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7148595 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7148596 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7148597 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7148598 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7148599 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7148600 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7148601 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7148602 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7148603 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7148604 elections have changed dramatically over the years money power and name recognition are the three basic ingredients for a winner whether or not that candidate has any qualifications
7148605 this is fine for the corporate world or the entertainment industry but not for democracy
7148606 voters are bombarded with repetitive subjective messages about the candidates personality and biography
7148607 the system seems designed to focus their attention on what the candidates look like or who is ahead rather than what they promise theyll do for the country with an awareness of the techniques campaigns use and how to find better information people can look beyond what the candidates want them to see and understand the truth about the people who are looking to represent them and how they propose to represent them
7148608 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7148609 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7148610 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7148611 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7148612 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7148613 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7148614 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7148615 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7148616 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7148617 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7148618 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7148619 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7148620 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7148621 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7148622 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7148623 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7148624 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7148625 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7148626 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7148627 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7148628 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7148629 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7148630 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7148631 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7148632 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7148633 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7148634 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7148635 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7148636 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7148637 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7148638 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7148639 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7148640 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7148641 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7148642 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7148643 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7148644 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7148645 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7148646 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7148647 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7148648 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7148649 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7148650 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7148651 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7148652 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7148653 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7148654 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7148655 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7148656 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7148657 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7148658 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7148659 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7148660 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7148661 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
7148662 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7148663 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7148664 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7148665 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7148666 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7148667 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7148668 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7148669 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7148670 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7148671 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7148672 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7148673 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7148674 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7148675 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7148676 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7148677 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7148678 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7148679 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7148680 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7148681 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7148682 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7148683 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7148684 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7148685 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7148686 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7148687 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7148688 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7148689 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7148690 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7148691 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7148692 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7148693 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7148694 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7148695 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7148696 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7148697 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7148698 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7148699 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7148700 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7148701 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7148702 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7148703 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7148704 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7148705 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7148706 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7148707 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7148708 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7148709 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7148710 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7148711 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7148712 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7148713 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7148714 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7148715 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7148716 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7148717 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7148718 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7148719 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7148720 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7148721 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7148722 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7148723 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7148724 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7148725 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7148726 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7148727 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7148728 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7148729 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7148730 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7148731 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7148732 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7148733 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7148734 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7148735 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7148736 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7148737 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7148738 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7148739 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7148740 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7148741 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7148742 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7148743 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7148744 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7148745 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7148746 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7148747 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7148748 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7148749 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7148750 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7148751 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7148752 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7148753 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7148754 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7148755 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7148756 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7148757 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7148758 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7148759 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7148760 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7148761 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7148762 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7148763 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7148764 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7148765 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7148766 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7148767 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7148768 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7148769 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7148770 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7148771 chelsea have agreed terms for andriy shevchenko to return to ac milan
7148772 after a series of frenetic phone calls during the whole day we reached an agreement with chelsea tomorrow he will be in milan monday he will undergo a medical and then sign a contract
7148773 all 22 guys showed great spirit and determination out there
7148774 that side won every trophy it competed for but this group of players is only in the beginning of the next phase for australian rugby
7148775 we let them back into the game with two soft tries at the end but then i must say we showed character and good composure to see it through
7148776 the big question now is whether we can back this up next week
7148777 we again created enough chances but just didnt finish off our execution was again a disappointment
7148778 the decision making was also not there tonight but i think it could be due to the fact many of the players are a bit flat theyre out on their feet after a long season but were on the right track
7148779 were world champions and weve lost two in a row so its understandable how the fans feel but it doesnt make it acceptable this is our job our passion we have to go and fix it
7148780 were looking forward to giving it a run and hopefully be one of the guys that will have a chance going into the back nine
7148781 so well see how it plays but it should be a very exciting finish to the first playoffs tournament
7148782 i was happy to kind of steal one from the rest of the field there
7148783 they were for the first two or three holes but then all of a sudden they changed dramatically with the heat and everything
7148784 they got extremely firm and it became quite difficult to be able to hit the ball somehow close to the hole and in some holes even to hit the green
7148785 overall i think its still a pretty good solid round it wasnt easy it wasnt playing easy at all so we have a good chance tomorrow so looking forward to that
7148786 thats what we work for it always gives you a little bit of confidence but youve just got to go out there and believe in yourself believe in your ability to play the game and hopefully play well enough to win if not at least have a chance at it and keep learning from it
7148787 if theres different winners if you manage to finish top five top three something like that i think you can have a chance
7148788 id love to obviously win a couple and make it a little bit easier on myself but if not the good thing i know is that theres still three weeks to go and you know just got to keep giving yourself chances
7148789 it will be a fun day for me streelman said
7148790 im interested to see how i kind of react to it and thats what ive been working for my whole life this has been a culmination of many many hours and years of hard work and a lot of miles traveled around many tours around the whole country and even world
7148791 like i said hopefully its just the beginning of many years of this but for many its kind of my first as of right now clubhouse lead going into sunday and if it goes well great and if not im going to try and learn as much like i did the day with tiger and try to get better tomorrow evening than i am right now
7148792 obviously you are probably going to lose more than youre going to win throughout your career if your name is not tiger woods said garcia who won the players in may
7148793 but its all about that you know he does that better than anybody else hes up there pretty much week in week out and thats what we all work for hoping the more chances we give to ourselves the greater the percentage we have of winning
7148794 that day with tiger was the greatest preparation i ever could have managed he said
7148795 i know it will be crazy tomorrow but i guarantee you it wont be quite as big as that day in san diego with tiger which was amazing it will be great preparation for me and if it works out tomorrow great and if not ill try to get myself in this position as many more times as possible
7148796 i dont think it affects anything i do you know ive been very focused on my own game the past three days and thats what ive got to continue to do tomorrow
7148797 but its entertaining i think the crowd doesnt know who to follow i think the tv guys dont know where to put the camera
7148798 i dont know im sure his first time there im sure he didnt do great as well streelman said
7148799 just like any profession just like you guys you when you wrote your first stories were not as good as you are now im sure
7148800 ill be praying for the widow all alone sewing clothes for a loaf of bread it is not my fault that she is hungry its my joy to make sure shes fed we are all related children of the king we may not have much but what we have we bring
7148801 this is the same president who talks about appeasement the same one who asks me to get on a plane and talk to qaddafi
7148802 the same president who made a deal with qaddafi he writes letters dear mr chairman to kim jong il
7148803 we should take zero backseat to this pres talking about appeasement under him israel is less safe
7148804 thats pretty damn good stuff and check out the idea that john mccain and joe lieberman are going to eliminate any vestige of iranian influence in iraq bless me father for i have sinned are they unaware of a border that has existed there for millennium are they unaware of the fact that our guy maliki is inviting ahmadinejad to baghdad and kissing him on both cheeks literally not figuratively are they unaware of the fact that this government in iraq feels compelled to visit tehran to explain what it is that they are attempting to do with a long term security agreement every single person out there that is of any consequence knows the vice president doesnt know what hes talking about i cant be more blunt than that
7148805 he is yet to be right one single time on iraq
7148806 the terrorists can win and quite often do and its global anarchy it sums up the randomness of geo politics pretty well
7148807 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
7148808 its absurd a beard can conceal someones identity are the police going to start banning beards
7148809 courage believe life in remembrance of john challis no 11
7148810 hes in love with you willow amp youre totally in love with him
7148811 tutto ordinato regolato dallalto ogni cosa che ti accade ti accade perch ha un senso
7148812 its more of an intensive situation than a regular dance class might be they really spend a great deal more time with each other they rehearse and take classes on weekends and throughout the week and really just learn a lot more about dance training they learn about the production of dance performances and really just get a closer nit experience with the group that gives them more opportunities to take outside classes masters classes and tour and things like that
7148813 your chances of getting raped in hollywood are slim unless you go to the
7148814 how can that be if i still have 5 more centimeters until im fully dilated
7148815 the barring of mr simpson from the centre raises issues of due process free speech and compliance with the policy of the centre
7148816 the letter from ms forbes roberts found mr simpson guilty of association with a blog entitled downtowneastsideenquirer blogspot com via links with blogspot com guilt by association is no basis for barring someone from a public facility and is an offensive concept with a long history of disrepute guilt by association is also contrary to the rule of law
7148817 i would have walked into the seniors lounge and devor would have been yelling at me to get out
7148818 began shouting at devor when a scene in a movie got loud
7148819 corroborated by 15 patrons in the lounge at that time
7148820 you wont find 15 people in the seniors lounge on any saturday afternoon when the suns shining
7148821 i went down there that day to use the computer cause i knew the place would be deserted i got a computer right away usually theres a waiting list
7148822 barring of me from the carnegie seniors computer room and third floor computer room be lifted
7148823 there is a requirement that members respect the policy off having no food or drink at the computer stations in order to avoid any damage to the machines particularly the keyboards i would encourage you to accept this policy as something that is for the benefit of all the users and you will then once again have access to the computers in the seniors centre
7148824 he got angry and he wouldnt talk to me about it
7148825 ive always loved the outdoors and am attracted to the visual composition and contrast of leaves snowflakes and plants
7148826 its not cool with the sort of rebellious punk street artist types to support something that is seen as a part of the system
7148827 obamas a rock star hes got a great brand and hes a very sexy candidate
7148828 its pretty unusual to find things that street artists and graffiti artists are in support of
7148829 i could go and volunteer at the campaign and make calls but thats probably not the best use of my skill set
7148830 a conscious effort to position obama in a certain way to position him as cool and to position him as hip
7148831 i try to document everything as we go along but i dont know ahead of time everything im going to paint i might have some portraits pictures of the boat pictures of water the main thing for me is to express the essence of what were doing
7148832 its quite suitable to the phoenicia expedition because thats where linen was originally grown and thats what the original sails would have been made out of 2 500 years ago
7148833 cartier the subtle magician who dangles slivers of the moon on a thread of sun
7148834 now 35 is the new 25 and in the industry everything is level so you can be your own boss
7148835 its a different landscape and the reality is yes we can survive doing this but it becomes more of a struggle
7148836 this weekend took a turn for the worst and now im a bit down
7148837 the drummer situation just imploded were back to square one we will be looking for drummers all week long we are here where are you
7148838 thats when i started thinking here i am in my 30s
7148839 its like society dictates by age 35 you have to have your own home and your family
7148840 wed be big for a week and they wouldnt miss us after the first show
7148841 im unlikely to see another nation come to maturity like china has with this olympics
7148842 theyre really staging this its really choreographed its not sustainable
7148843 but theres a lot that is fake its lost a lot of its unique character
7148844 i constantly get the feeling that i shouldnt say anything that could be a slur against china i feel a lot of pressure to get the image
7148845 id like to come back after the olympics and see what its really like
7148846 if brazil had a stronger central government wed probably avoid a lot of anarchy like robberies and people being kidnapped
7148847 a lot of people who wouldnt come to china will consider it now
7148848 it does bring the country into the fold of the international community
7148849 i asked her how could someone burn their own history
7148850 she became very uncomfortable she told me i wouldnt understand she didnt try to explain
7148851 claro que estamos a trabalhar numa expans o e esperamos poder lan la j no pr ximo ano ainda estamos ponderar a data de lan amento mas estamos confiantes de que ser segundo o previsto
7148852 o desenvolvimento est a correr muito bem as possibilidades e melhorias que vamos oferecer ser o sensacionais novos personagens locais ou armas s o alguns dos nossos principais pontos de trabalho
7148853 theres a lot of revenue thats made that you cant argue is illegal but fees dont have to be as high as they are
7148854 people feel they have to be nice and that if they upset the person across the table they wont get anything
7148855 a whole industry has grown up making money off families money
7148856 what has happened is over the last decade and probably more the trustee corporations have placed profit in front of ethics
7148857 most of this is through their management who regard fees as the most important part of the business rather than delivering service or looking after clients
7148858 under managements direction each branch was directed to come up with special fees which for an average branch would be around 250 000 upwards if they had four trust officers each trust officer was supposed to come up with so called special fees of around 20 000 per month
7148859 the key thing here is we dont charge for work that hasnt been completed
7148860 theres no question that we are a commercial organisation and we have shareholders and we intend to make a profit thats nothing to be ashamed about
7148861 in public trust we did see a real shift from an organisation that was very client centric to very much a revenue and profit driven organisation
7148862 trustee corporations would be similar to any other corporate where the powers that be the executives set their budgets for the organisation and have various ways to cascade that down
7148863 as long as i am chief executive we will never progress to the point of incentivising or creating the expectation of not selling to need
7148864 like many things in new zealand it has been left unattended for a long time
7148865 are estate companies better than each other i dont know but there needs to be a commission of inquiry a full shake out of trust and estate management in new zealand
7148866 is there a problem the fact you sunday star times

7148910 once i injured the ankle in trials i knew what lay in store still instead of backtracking i decided to give it a go after all this is olympics and i have put in a lot of efforts just for this occasion
7148911 but i guess once you injure your take off ankle you really dont have anything to do
7148912 no this is the first time that i hurt it its not a strain or twist but i hurt the joint and just could not take off and it only aggravated when the qualifying round started i could neither run nor take off gt
7148913 probably it was not great but then i did not go full throttle all i wanted to do was to peak at the right time and give my best where it matters most unfortunately my ankle held me back

7148935 i extracted some hair from the alleged corpse and examined it and had some concerns
7148936 we burned said sample and said hair sample melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair
7148937 at that time we contacted searching for bigfoot ceo tom biscardi who was present at the press conference who gave us permission to begin an expedited melting process
7148938 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head as i was now able to touch it i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
7148939 as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
7148940 later that day tom biscardi informed us that both matthew whitton and ricky dyer admitted it was a costume
7148941 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time
7148942 it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud in a felonious manner
7148943 its all about money with him it probably didnt matter to him whether it was real or not
7148944 mr whitton and mr dyer probably started out small as a way to promote their bigfoot tracking business and got in way over their heads
7148945 we were thinking we were going to see a lot of thin barley and a lot of feed barley as it turned it was just the opposite a higher percentage of malt barley which was a very welcome surprise vo continues haugeberg says the early wheat numbers are also looking good

7148954 thats the last she will see of him and thats the last you will see of him
7148955 tim is off on a search to rescue the princess she has been snatched by a horrible and evil monster this happened because tim made a mistake
7148956 not just one he made many mistakes during the time they spent together all those years ago memories of their relationship have become muddled replaced wholesale but one remains clear the princess turning sharply away her braid lashing at him with contempt
7148957 he knows she tried to be forgiving but who can just shrug away a guilty lie a stab in the back such a mistake will change a relationship irreversibly even if we have learned from the mistake and would never repeat it the princesss eyes grew narrower she became more distant
7148958 our world with its rules of causality has trained us to be miserly with forgiveness by forgiving them too readily we can be badly hurt but if weve learned from a mistake and became better for it shouldnt we be rewarded for the learning rather than punished for the mistake
7148959 what if our world worked differently suppose we could tell her i didnt mean what i just said and she would say its okay i understand and she would not turn away and life would really proceed as though we had never said that thing we could remove the damage but still be wiser for the experience
7148960 tim and the princess lounge in the castle garden laughing together giving names to the colorful birds their mistakes are hidden from each other tucked away between the folds of time safe
7148961 all those years ago tim had left the princess behind he had kissed her on the neck picked up his travel bag and walked out the door he regrets this to a degree now hes journeying to find her again to show her knows how sad it was but also to tell her how good it was
7148962 for a long time he thought they had been cultivating the perfect relationship he had been fiercely protective reversing all his mistakes so they would not touch her likewise keeping a tight rein on her own mistakes she always pleased him
7148963 but to be fully couched within the comfort of a friend is a mode of existence with severe implications to please you perfectly she must understand you perfectly thus you cannot defy her expectations or escape her reach her benevolence has circumscribed you and your lifes achievements will not reach beyond the map she has drawn
7148964 tim needed to be non manipulable he needed a hope of transcendence he needed sometimes to be immune to the princesss caring touch
7148965 off in the distance tim saw a castle where the flags flutter even when the wind has expired and the bread in the kitchen is always warm a little bit of magic
7148966 visiting his home for a holiday meal tim felt as though he had regressed to those long ago years when he lived under their roof oppressed by their insistence on upholding strange values which to him were meaningless back then bickering would erupt over drops of gravy spilt onto the tablecloth
7148967 escaping tim walked in the cool air toward the university hed attended after moving out of his parents home as he distanced himself from that troubling house he felt the embarrassment of childhood fading into the past but now he stepped into all the insecurities hed felt at the university all the panic of walking a social tightrope
7148968 tim only felt relieved after the whole visit was over sitting back home in the present steeped in contrast he saw how hed improved so much from those old days this improvement day by day takes him ever closer to finding the princess if she exists she must she will transform him and everyone
7148969 he felt on his trip that every place stirs up an emotion and every emotion invokes a memory a time and location so couldnt he find the princess now tonight just by wandering from place to place and noticing how he feels a trail of feelings of awe and inspiration should lead him to that castle in the future her arms enclosing him her scent fills him with excitement creates a moment so strong he can remember it in the past
7148970 immediately tim walked out his door the next morning toward whatever the new day held he felt something like optimism
7148971 she never understood the impulses that drove him never quite felt the intensity that over time chiseled lines into his face she never quite felt close enough to him but he held her as though she were whispered into her ear words that only a soul mate should receive
7148972 over the remnants of dinner they both knew the time had come he would have said i have to go find the princess but he didnt need to giving a final kiss hoisting a travel bag to his shoulder he walked out the door through all the nights that followed she still loved him as though he stayed to comfort her and protect her princess be damned
7148973 perhaps in a perfect world the ring would be a symbol of happiness its a sign of ceaselessness devotion even if he will never find the princess he will always be trying he still will wear the ring
7148974 but the thing makes its presence known it shines out to others like a beacon of warning it makes people slow to approach suspicion distrust interactions are torpedoed before tim can open his mouth
7148975 in time he learns to deal with the others carefully he matches their hesitant pace tracing a soft path through their defenses but this exhausts him and it only works to a limited degree it doesnt get him what he needs
7148976 tim begins to hide the ring in his pocket but he can hardly bear it too long tucked away that part of him might suffocate
7148977 at a cafe on a bright plaza most customers sit back feeling the warmth of the sun enjoying their cold drinks but not tim he barely notices the sun doesnt really taste his coffee for him this corner affords a good view of the city and in the teetering of the passers by in the arc of a hand as she displays tea to an interested gentleman tim hopes to see clues
7148978 that night at the cinema fictitious adventurers lunge implausibly across the screen the audience here is mixed some are patrons of the cafe now sitting excitedly in the plush chairs eager for another new flavor for distraction from the boredom of their easy lives other seats hold fisherman and farm workers hoping to forget their toils and rest their hands
7148979 tim is here too but he is scrutinizing the gloss on the lips on the screen measuring the angle of the plume of a distant helicopter crash he thinks he discerns a message when the cinema closes and most of the audience strolls down the plaza to the south tim goes north
7148980 people like tim seem to live oppositely from the other residents of the city tide and riptide flowing against each other
7148981 tim wants like nothing else to find the princess to know her at last for tim this would be momentous sparking an intense light that embraces the world a light that reveals the secrets long kept from us that illuminates or materializes a final palace where we can exist in peace
7148982 but how would this be perceived by the other residents of the city in the world that flows contrariwise the light would be intense and warm at the beginning but then flicker down to nothing taking the castle with it it would be like burning down the place weve always called home where we played so innocently as children destroying all hope of safety forever
7148983 the boy called for the girl to follow him and he took her hand he would protect her they would make their way through this oppressive castle fighting off the creatures made of smoke and doubt escaping to a life of freedom the boy wanted to protect the girl he held her hand or put his arm around her shoulders in a walking embrace to help her feel supported and close to him amid the impersonal throngs of manhattan they turned and made their way toward the canal st subway station and he picked a path through the jostling crowd
7148984 he worked his ruler and his compass he inferred he deduced he scrutinized the fall of an apple the twisting of metal orbs hanging from a thread he was searching for the princess and he would not stop until he found her for he was hungry he cut rats into pieces to examine their brains implanted tungsten posts into the skulls of water starved monkeys
7148985 he scrutinized the fall of an apple the twisting of metal orbs hanging from a thread through these clues he would find the princess see her face after an especially fervent night of tinkering he kneeled behind a bunker in the desert he held a piece of welders glass up to his eyes and waited
7148986 on that moment hung eternity time stood still space contracted to a pinpoint it was as though the earth had opened and the skies split one felt as though he had been privileged to witness the birth of the world
7148987 someone else said now we are all sons of bitches
7148988 the candy store everything he wanted was on the opposite side of that pane of glass the store was decorated in bright colors and the scents wafting out drove him crazy he tried to rush for the door or just get closer to the glass but he couldnt she held him back with great strength why would she hold him back how might he break free of her grasp he considered violence
7148989 he cannot say he has understood all of this possibly hes more confused now than ever but all these moments hes contemplated something has occurred the moments feel substantial in his mind like stones kneeling reaching down toward the closest one running his hand across it he finds it smooth and slightly cold
7148990 he tests the stones weight he finds he can lift in and the others too he can fit them together to create a foundation an embankment a castle
7148991 to build a castle of appropriate size he will need a great many stones

7149051 it was the only ball that was down he did a good job of hitting it

7149073 i had no idea who he was going to choose i was kind of hoping for evan bayh
7149074 im a little disappointed that were not going to have one of our own on the national ticket it would have been exciting for indiana to have a hoosier running for the vice presidency
7149075 i think probably senator obama realized that spending millions of dollars here with negative false negative ads and talking to senator bayh wouldnt be enough to win indiana
7149076 its important to note that bad news always sells well in the media but when companies are actually adding staff you very rarely see that
7149077 that creates a very unbalanced picture of whats actually happening
7149078 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7149079 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape yes its slowing but its not slowing unduly
7149080 genetic variation can have very subtle effects that are difficult to measure with even the most precise equipment for example when looking for big differences in perception scientists find people who distinguish between greens and reds but may be missing the subtle variations among people who can distinguish between reds and red oranges
7149081 every time i see a cute young co ed these days all i can think is potential babysitter

7149083 he was very confused and maybe even a little embarrassed and thought that maybe he had a plumbers crack showing he understood what i meant when i showed him this book
7149084 it doesnt matter if you win or loose as long as we beat new zealand
7149085 they are wrong and do not know what they are looking at
7149086 this is a guy who lives in my neighborhood whos a professor of english in chicago who i know and who i have not received some official endorsement from hes not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
7149087 and the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense george
7149088 so this kind of game in which anybody who i know regardless of how flimsy the relationship is is somehow somehow their ideas could be attributed to me i think the american people are smarter than that theyre not going to suggest somehow that that is reflective of my views because it obviously isnt
7149089 bill ayers lives in his neighborhood their kids attend the same school
7149090 theyre certainly friendly they know each other as anyone whose kids go to school together
7149091 you were 350 lbs when i married you and ugly enough to stop a train but now youre a babe i want out
7149092 screw that for an idea after six months of relative segregation its time to go out and par tay

7149094 barack obama introduced sen joe biden saturday as his vice presidential running mate positioning the senates fifth most senior member as
7149095 its always nine to 12 months in arrears every time there is an increase
7149096 they calculate the cpi in december then pay that out in april and thats for the previous 12 months so thats got to do us for the prices were getting over the next 12 months
7149097 we are looking at something but if it doesnt come off then we will carry on as we are
7149098 se vedesse questo farebbe del gran tossire e fingerebbe di morire per sfuggire al ridicolo ed io dovrei far mostra di curarlo perche se no per umiliarmi si lascerebbe veramente morire
7149099 kenoticism differs from socinianism fundamentally however in that socinianism took away from us only our divine christ while kenoticism takes away also our very god
7149100 its more of an artists community for a certain market segment that wanted something different theres been enough people that have come through that would say what a wonderful concept but then the market crashed and everyone went home

7149106 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
7149107 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7149108 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
7149109 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
7149110 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
7149111 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
7149112 the los angeles times kicked off a major series on forest fires heres part of what it said the governments long campaign to tame wildfires has perversely made the problem worse by stamping out most wildland blazes as quickly as possible the forest service has stymied natures housekeeping the frequent well behaved fires that once cleaned up the pine forests of the sierra nevada and the southwest now woodlands are tangled with thick growth and dead branches when fires break out they often explode sound familiar clearly the analogy between financial crises and forest fires is solid and i told tom that just as the feds growing tendency to solve every problem led people to take greater risks the policy of fighting fires early also created moral hazard by encouraging people to build homes further into the forest it fell to the community to keep those unwisely built structures safe just as the government now feels it has to rescue subprime borrowers and financial institutions capitalism can produce great results but participants have to be allowed to both win and lose

7149122 veel mensen hebben een beeld van het jongerencentrum als zou het een donker hol zijn waar jongeren alcohol drinken en drugs gebruiken
7149123 ik wil in elk geval graag voor agovv blijven voetballen bij stormvogels telstar liep ik een beetje met de pest in mijn lijf rond ik was fit en klaar om te spelen maar de trainer luc nijholt red koos steeds maar weer voor jan bruin ik heb veel respect voor jan hij heeft veel betekend voor telstar maar afgelopen seizoen bakte hij er weinig van toch kreeg jan steeds de voorkeur dat was ik beu en ik wilde wat anders
7149124 het is een leuke club en de spelersgroep zit goed in elkaar klopt ik heb nog niet zoveel gespeeld maar ruud ter heide verdiende natuurlijk de voorkeur nu ruud vertrekt naar cambuur zijn mijn kansen toegenomen ik hoop een contract te kunnen tekenen ik vraag echt niet de hoofdprijs ben best bereid om wat water bij de wijn te doen
7149125 wij zijn alleen niet uit op het maken van winst maar op het cre ren van werkgelegenheid
7149126 toch is het maken van winst belangrijk om een buffer op te bouwen we hebben tenslotte ook minder goede tijden gekend we hebben nu plannen voor een nieuwe kantine voor het personeel die aan alle arbo eisen voldoet verder moeten we nog wat aanpassingen doen in verband met brandveiligheidseisen
7149127 we hebben aangifte gedaan bij de politie maar er niets van teruggehoord de schade bedroeg inclusief de aanhangwagen 3 500 euro dat is vooral zuur voor de vrijwilligers die heel veel tijd hebben gestoken in het uit elkaar halen van alle spullen

7149138 yum yum yum can we have a piece of that
7149139 everything absolutely everything has been for this i knew it was a far chance but i did everything absolutely everything i could to give myself the best chance of doing it its actually happened i never thought it would
7149140 coming back and doing everything i did was to win an olympic gold medal when i was training every single day twice a day eleven sessions a week thirty hours a week before every single dive i said to myself i want to win an olympic gold
7149141 the reason i hadnt confirmed dates in australia is i really didnt know what i was getting into

7149143 the chinese people have done alot for us to learn from
7149144 look at beijing as a model for what theyve done and then consider how we can best address these questions for our city
7149145 whoever you are from wherever you are how you are
7149146 they will get to enjoy the city in the heart of the city
7149147 enjoyed the size of beijing very much but in our plan athletes can enjoy their travels because they will be in the center of the city
7149148 its very important to work closely with volunteers and to bring the same atmosphere to the games in tokyo
7149149 he would have needed a lot of skill to get to the ball and he has it

7149157 as far as israeli law is concerned it is a part of israel like tel aviv or haifa so why are we even talking about considering giving it back
7149158 freudian slip that it said betrayed the 47 year old senator obamas unreadiness to serve as commander in chief
7149159 obama from the crowd in springfield illinois and a rueful smile from the vp hopeful
7149160 it isnt like there was a staff meeting to say this is the person we were all signed up for the text messages like you one of the aides said
7149161 obama biden banners made their debut in springfield as the 35 000 strong crowd gave a rapturous welcome to the two democrats standing on the same steps where senator obama launched his white house quest back in february 2007

7149167 las estrellas que actualmente est n presentes alrededor de los gigantescos agujeros negros de nuestra galaxia son relativamente j venes unos 10 millones de a os lo que sugiere que este proceso es probablemente repetitivo
7149168 tal suplidor constante de estrellas en la vecindad de los agujeros negros y una dieta de gas acrecentada por el agujero negro podr a ayudarnos a entender el origen de estos gigantescos hoyos tanto en nuestra galaxia como en otras del universo

7149172 ladies and gentleman the reckoning is now the reality is we must answer the call or we will risk the harshest verdict and version in history these times call for a total change in washingtons world view these times call for more than just a good soldier
7149173 i would never serve under senator obama as a cabinet member
7149174 in the debates you said barack obama had no experience to be president of the united states
7149175 it is the driving engine of our growth and success as a community
7149176 viva la familia event wants to remind us all that the most important social institution is the family
7149177 the family formed when a man and woman marry for their common good and for the procreation and education of their children it is this spirit of celebrating and growing as hispanic families that we will gather

7149181 therefore put on gods complete armor that you may be able to resist and stand your ground on the evil day of danger and having done all the crisis demands to stand firmly in your place
7149182 stand therefore hold your ground having tightened the belt of truth around your loins and having put on the breastplate of integrity and of moral rectitude and right standing with god
7149183 and having shod your feet in preparation to face the enemy with the firm footed stability the promptness and the readiness produced by the good news of the gospel of peace
7149184 pray at all times on every occasion in every season in the spirit with all manner of prayer and entreaty to that end keep alert and watch with strong purpose and perseverance interceding in behalf of all the saints gods consecrated people
7149185 being a good corporate sponsor of the beijing games has sadly not meant being a good corporate citizen
7149186 after government attempts to appeal to employers sense of corporate social responsibility fell on deaf ears
7149187 mr corporate manager you are not only socially responsible for funding our olympic athletes you are also socially responsible for combating any political economic social or cultural ills that activists may discover in the host country
7149188 tangent and obsessing over it much more than i should and i gotta remember its
7149189 ah well theres nothing here for black people you know what i mean

7149192 if you bring a speaker in people hear the message once
7149193 but if you have cds people can hear it again and again
7149194 people generally understood the situation nobody quit and we said we hoped in the future that the situation will change
7149195 if you just focus on the doom and gloom everybody gets depressed if you focus on an inspiring message everybody thinks youre a pollyanna
7149196 you need to sympathize with the pain people are having yet demand high performance
7149197 when employees see the results of their efforts they understand how that helps the company and how it helps other employees
7149198 if its a toxic environment and youre my manager and you say good morning im thinking what does he really mean by that
7149199 you cant stop that from happening but shes out there every day with folks asking what are you hearing
7149200 its going to be hell and im going to be completely burnt out all the time

7149203 we missed that wave so were going to have to get started
7149204 and probably denver is the next place to do that
7149205 how many regular voters really care about some fat cats sitting in denver
7149206 you have people here who know the state it just makes sense to use them
7149207 it was a record turnout in a presidential preference primary that supposedly did not count
7149208 they feel like they have some skin in the game
7149209 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me
7149210 delegates here in denver are already buzzing with strong enthusiasm for the obama biden ticket
7149211 senator obamas selection shows that unlike the bush mccain way of doing politics obama is not afraid to have strong people around him helping to lead our great country
7149212 senator joe biden has always been a champion for children and public education
7149213 after eight disastrous years of the bush administrations failed education policies sen barack obamas selection of sen biden as his vice presidential running mate signals a true change in the way the federal government will support the children and educators of this nation
7149214 an obama biden ticket will staunchly support public schools lead to a stronger economy and a stronger more secure nation this team will lead us to a democratic victory in november
7149215 change to win members and leaders are excited to see senator biden added to a winning obama team
7149216 joe biden is a great choice for american workers and labor
7149217 change to win members have spent thousands of hours walking precincts making phone calls and passing out materials at our worksites since endorsing barack obama six months ago and todays announcement gives us a great boost as we prepare for the convention and the hard work ahead of us before victory for obama biden and americas workers on november 4th
7149218 the rncs new clock will count the hours minutes and seconds until bidens next slip up on the campaign trail

7149229 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7149230 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7149231 theres a lot of revenue thats made that you cant argue is illegal but fees dont have to be as high as they are
7149232 people feel they have to be nice and that if they upset the person across the table they wont get anything
7149233 a whole industry has grown up making money off families money
7149234 what has happened is over the last decade and probably more the trustee corporations have placed profit in front of ethics
7149235 most of this is through their management who regard fees as the most important part of the business rather than delivering service or looking after clients
7149236 under managements direction each branch was directed to come up with special fees which for an average branch would be around 250 000 upwards if they had four trust officers each trust officer was supposed to come up with so called special fees of around 20 000 per month
7149237 the key thing here is we dont charge for work that hasnt been completed
7149238 theres no question that we are a commercial organisation and we have shareholders and we intend to make a profit thats nothing to be ashamed about
7149239 in public trust we did see a real shift from an organisation that was very client centric to very much a revenue and profit driven organisation
7149240 trustee corporations would be similar to any other corporate where the powers that be the executives set their budgets for the organisation and have various ways to cascade that down
7149241 as long as i am chief executive we will never progress to the point of incentivising or creating the expectation of not selling to need
7149242 like many things in new zealand it has been left unattended for a long time

7149261 my name is ahmad shah andiwal from azizabad village i am talking from the area which was bombarded yesterday night we will continue our protest until we get a clear answer because nothing is left for us a man was killed a few months before and there was a religious ceremony for his death but someone had reported to the government officials that taliban fighters were brought up to the village to attack the airport of shendan district i was there and i did not witness any taliban fighters or al qaeda members

7149263 this weeks burn notice features the return of a client from the first season an ex navy seal called virgil
7149264 as a british citizen i am ashamed at my country
7149265 i dont talk about the 2009 roster while we are still in the middle of the 2008 season
7149266 very frustrating i can tell you if you have been doing this as long as i have i have had seasons like this in the past they are never fun again its easier truly its easier for me than it is for fans because i have been through it and i do understand the bigger picture which i always focus on on the other hand it is also more painful for me than fans because i need to win i want to win quicker than anybody quicker than any of our fans do so while the big picture gives me a comfort it does not make any individual day any easier i have never been able to sleep after a loss consequently i have had 11 rough days
7149267 some of it is rebuilding but lets face it anyone that observes this will look at some of the lineups weve put out there over these last few months and acknowledge that there was no way we were anticipating fielding those kind of lineups that was not anyones plan to field the lineups weve seen sometimes this year and there is no point reviewing why that is what has happened to us during the year but again there is nothing big picture wise that concerns me but the little picture the day to day has just been very painful
7149268 well it is because as i have said i have had 100 loss seasons before i may have one again this year maybe not hope not i have had tough years in hockey and basketball i have and as long as you are on the right course which i believe we are to making the right decisions i do know you get over it quickly once you turn the corner that is a comfort but it doesnt make today any easier
7149269 actually thats kind of the most amazing thing that i have been talking about all through this rough season our attendance keeps rising its an amazing phenomenon this past week we went over the 30 000 average mark in attendance all through our travails it re enforces what i believed when i first got here the fan base here has the potential to be enormous and steadfast like weve seen with other teams here and when we get our job done with respect to the team on the field this is going to be huge smiling ive always felt that i have always told you that when i came and whats happened this summer has re enforced my belief in that the fans have been fantastic
7149270 well of course there is there will be surely we want to keep everyone every team has a shakeout in year two of anything it happened in rfk in 2006 it wouldnt surprise me if it happened again here for 2009 it happens in every other market so i dont know exactly what to predict for next year but i feel very strongly that we get whatever attendance we deserve i never worry about high attendance levels we get what we deserve fans have shown they will do their job purchase tickets they will do their job if we first do our job field a competitive team so i dont worry about it as ive said they fans have responded above and beyond expectations i am not worried about fans they will do their job i worry about us first getting our job done
7149271 no not at all i find the criticisms here not harsh you know we have had this discussion before i have a couple of things i say about that i remind everyone the immortal words of hyman roth to michael corleone the godfather in that hotel in havana this is the life we chose criticism comes with it i also tell people i have been in this exact same spot before what i have learned from years is that they critics have invented no new insults chuckling i have been called everything before sohna laughing and there will be times when i am called it again you know all i can do is the best job i can so again big picture wise its been a very positive year below washington below the major league team in our system even though we have had some key injuries down there too its no where near as many as we have had up here
7149272 so i dont like criticism particularly i am disappointed when it turns personal and you see that from time to time more so because of the internet but not more here than in other cities i disagree with that premise the criticism is much milder here than in other cities
7149273 ok well that again is no new insult i have heard that before in my career i have heard that about people in other cities and in my other cities and i think the people who said that always wind up looking foolish
7149274 i have never experienced every single member of your opening day lineup going out for an extended period of time i dont think that has ever been done before hooray joking no i never have
7149275 i have heard that question i have my own questions we are going to look into all the appropriate questions to find the right answers but sure i understand those questions being asked
7149276 it is unusual its never intentional we always try to rush guys up to fill out the roster but we have guys that look like they have two or three day injuries then end up being out a week and then they linger into an injured list placement thats frustrating and we have had more of that than we have seen before i am not sure why and i am not happy about it there is no reason to play short so much it shouldnt happen and we need to figure out why that has happened
7149277 sohna all i can tell you is that i am told day to day i am not hiding anything i am told the same things and i have the same questions
7149278 i know i hear you jesus flores was day to day on sunday and he was back in the lineup last night tuesday i think we have an ethic in all sports about not missing games and going out there and playing hurt but i think everyones first reaction is to minimize the severity and length of an injury no matter how badly hurt they are i think we always try thats the first instinct to see how it is in a day or two well for that day or two until you are finally figuring out the diagnosis to be sure so that is part of the reason but still in all we have had more than our share of those situations which require some answers
7149279 i think that happened wily mo pena did the same thing and in retrospect i know they were trying to help themselves and the team it wound up not doing either any good we cant tell a guy he is hurt when he is claiming he is not hurt thats the other side of that but we never tell a guy to go out there to play when we know they are hurt you just cant do that
7149280 yes i know i was actually on vacation when that happened and i talked to jim bowden when i saw it jim felt bad about the circumstances of how that happened you know he did apologize jim felt bad about that too
7149281 i think jim would agree with you on that and did so by apologizing and i have since talked to chad myself i dont think there is any lingering issue with chad but i cant disagree with you on this
7149282 you would have to talk to jim on that nick is out for the year obviously or presumably out for the year chad is out for the year shawn hill is going to i think attempt to come back around the first of september
7149283 wily mo i think is gone for this season elijah dukes should make a re hab start within the week same with alberto gonzalez and dmitri i think within a week should be able to start in fact i had a good report about dmitri yesterday in both his weight and his diabetes if that has found the appropriate level and he can get back out on the field that would be a good thing for all the criticism he endured he was still like our most reliable hitter even in the 50 games he played this year he still gets on base like 40 of the time and on this team this year that would have been really valuable
7149284 it would worry me if that were a constant thing no one can say thats the way we treat people thats why it was an anomaly so i am not worried about that
7149285 i expect to get better and if its free agency trades or international signings we just have to get better and i dont think you care if the players we get are through free agency nor should you care you shouldnt accept excuses you shouldnt care how we do it you should just demand that we do it get better on the field like what i always say about payroll you dont care about what we pay these guys you just want the team to be good so yeah i am not ever going to rule anything out
7149286 big free agents small free agents this year we had a need a short term need we thought we filled that short term need with paul loduca who went off and got hurt the way that was suppose to work was paul was suppose to be our starter for at least a half a season if not the whole season while we moved jesus flores in if he had not gotten hurt thats how it would have worked out so we did go into the free agent market when we had that particular need i like building internally but you cant get it done by just building internally i know that i know that mainly we need to get good and we cant use any excuses for doing it one way over another way
7149287 yes i have heard this before thats an odd thing to be saying this year when there may be the lowest correlation between payroll and winning in decades there are two teams way at the top of the standings tampa amp minnesota with payrolls way below ours obviously there are teams that are way way at the top of payroll that are not going to make the post season so this is an odd year to still hang on to that claim
7149288 i didnt see that comment but how it that different from anything they have done in the past that is their operating philosophy not ours thats not a change to me that is what they believe in
7149289 but there was a backlash soon to follow with ronald reagan and margaret thatcher changing the world as perhaps no two other people did during the second half of the 20th century
7149290 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7149291 like so many people around the world i have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration
7149292 to all the participants and to everyone who has supported them so well i send my warmest congratulations
7149293 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7149294 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7149295 if the project an eu olympic team seems ambitious the concept is rather easy to understand at every international sports competition we realise that if the european countries medals were counted together the european union would have a much stronger weight in the traditional medals list and would be able to really compete with the usa china or russia
7149296 the german french italian and dutch teams have all done well too it is frankly bonkers to claim that all our countries athletes would do better if they were put into one team and made to compete under an eu flag
7149297 why on earth is the eu commission lavishing taxpayers money on these euro federalists to come up with nutty ideas like this
7149298 if player moves to postition x and is holding y then do z
7149299 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 cast iron damage proof
7149300 the contrast was all the more striking because until that point shed always had a memory like a website
7149301 from the fateful day of our lunch telltale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7149302 whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7149303 it might be something innocuous such as what time is my car coming or when am i going to the hairdresser but the fact she needed to repeat them opened a new and frightening chapter in our lives

7149327 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of two per cent

7149391 under managements direction each branch was directed to come up with special fees which for an average branch would be around 250 000 upwards if they had four trust officers each trust officer was supposed to come up with so called special fees of around 20 000 per month

7149462 i used to consider myself an anti racist i even once sat on the board of directors of an anti racist organization today i have trouble recognizing myself in what this belief system has become why did i identify with anti racism i saw it as a means to defend non european peoples who had become politically and demographically marginalized often to the brink of extinction this was and still is the case with canadas first nations but its also the case with many other peoples including some that are oppressed by governments in africa asia and latin america as an anthropologist in particular i saw anti racism as a moral duty i dont believe in conspiracy theories but i do believe that ideologies can be exploited to serve new ends in this case anti racism has gradually become an instrument of political disenfranchisement and demographic replacement in a word the very thing it used to combat this gradual change has turned what was once an ideology of the left into an ideology of the right anti racism now serves the interests of a corporate globalist elite for whom the free flow of labor dovetails with their belief in the free flow of capital and trade for these people it doesnt matter that their ideology will destroy long existing cultures and populations they dont even feel guilty about what theyre doing anti racism gives them a clean conscience
7149463 though few of the bits of human genetic code that vary between individuals have yet to be tied to physical or behavioural traits scientists have found that roughly 10 percent of them are more common in certain continental groups and can be used to distinguish people of different races
7149464 there are clear differences between people of different continental ancestries
7149465 its not there yet for things like i q but i can see it coming and it has the potential to spark a new era of racism if we do not start explaining it better
7149466 the authority that dna has earned through its use in freeing falsely convicted inmates preventing disease and reconstructing family ties leads people to wrongly elevate genetics over other explanations for differences between groups
7149467 ive spent the last 10 years of my life researching how much genetic variability there is between populations
7149468 but living in america it is so clear that the economic and social and educational differences have so much more influence than genes people just somehow fixate on genetics even if the influence is very small
7149469 but on the half sigma blog and elsewhere the conversation is already flashing forward to what might happen if genetically encoded racial differences in socially desirable or undesirable traits are identified
7149470 if i were to believe the facts in this post what should i do
7149471 should i advocate discrimination against blacks because they are less smart should i not hire them to my company because odds are i could find a smarter white person stop trying to prove that one group of people are genetically inferior to your group just stop
7149472 renata mcgriff 52 a health care consultant who had been encouraging black clients to volunteer genetic information to scientists said she and other african americans have lately been discussing
7149473 i dont want the children in my family to be born thinking they are less than someone else based on their dna
7149474 yet even some self described liberals argue that accepting that there may be genetic differences between races is important in preparing to address them politically
7149475 lets say the genetic data says well have to spend two times as much for every black child to close the achievement gap
7149476 can be given educational and occupational opportunities that work best for their unique talents and limitations
7149477 others hope that the genetic data may overturn preconceived notions of racial superiority by for example showing that africans are innately more intelligent than other groups
7149478 regardless of any such genetic variation it is our moral duty to treat all as equal before god and before the law
7149479 it is not necessary argued dr clark a retired neonatologist in leawood kan who is white to maintain the pretense that inborn racial differences do not exist
7149480 when was the last time a nonblack sprinter won the olympic 100 meters

7149482 race many sociologists and anthropologists have argued for decades is a social invention historically used to justify prejudice and persecution but when
7149483 before it was im white because i have white skin and grew up in white culture
7149484 now its i really know im white so white is this big neon sign hanging over my head its like oh no come on that wasnt the point
7149485 race matters and we should all be free to be who we are

7149496 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7149497 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7149498 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7149499 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7149500 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7149501 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7149502 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7149503 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7149504 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7149505 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7149506 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7149507 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7149508 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7149509 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7149510 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7149511 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7149512 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7149513 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7149514 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7149515 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7149516 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7149517 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7149518 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7149519 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7149520 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7149521 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7149522 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7149523 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7149524 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7149525 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7149526 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll

7149552 as only mother teresa can she prevailed upon me to take this baby and another baby to the united states for medical care

7149559 the russian federation and the united states are not about to enter a new cold war even if tensions between moscow and washington rise dramatically

7149571 they his young players have to work harder to get back into the game so it probably does deflate the young blokes
7149572 you dont necessarily need senior players that have been in the game for so long making off the ball decisions like they do
7149573 i am not going to blame just him for the loss
7149574 there were other aspects to it as well and jeff will take that loss as hard as anyone
7149575 but it just makes it so hard for the younger group to gain any sort of resolve when things like that farmers costly off the ball free kick happens
7149576 i dont want to commend losing and there were frustrating periods in the game which we just dont handle well
7149577 we went with a small forward line in the absence of pavlich and tarrant and quite often we caused a lot of confusion in the richmond defence and that was the pleasing part when you havent got the organisational skills of pavlich and tarrant down there

7149582 the korean team stayed at eight gold medals for a while then we added two more thursday clearly achieving our goal i want to take this opportunity to thank the athletes and the people for their support i hope there is renewed recognition for taekwondo and support in the nation
7149583 i want to thank all the people involved for their support i will do my best to earn a gold in london as well
7149584 thank you all along i felt that i was representing korea and thats why i believe i obtained the good result
7149585 i didnt sleep at all last night because i couldnt believe i won the gold
7149586 ill be more sure when i go back to korea
7149587 the day before the competition was my birthday because it was my birthday i thought something good would happen to me that id have a good day tomorrow that night i dreamed that a friend congratulated me for winning the gold

7149601 i think it goes back to sen obamas experience in community service and community organizing
7149602 were seeing a lot of money pouring into that race so that will be one to watch
7149603 theres a lot of frustration right now as a result of the budget cuts
7149604 we would certainly hope all the people who have registered with an eye on the november election will become enthusiastic voters and turn out for the aug 26 election as well
7149605 its possible the general excitement of the 2008 presidential election is going to bring more people to the polls for the primary but if those newly registered voters are really just waiting until nov 4 we could see a decrease in the percentage for turnout on tuesday
7149606 it was a brief conversation theyve known each other for years
7149607 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7149608 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7149609 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7149610 its not jazz that is dying clearly there are musicians worth seeing producing music worth the audience thats on life support
7149611 this is a scientific approach to highlight and explain stuff white people like they are pretty predictable
7149612 its not easy to make the infamous willie horton ad from the 1988 presidential campaign seem benign but suggesting that barack obama is the antichrist might just do it
7149613 the ad was the creation of fred davis one of mccains top media gurus as well as a close friend of former christian coalition head ralph reed and the nephew of conservative oklahoma senator james inhofe
7149614 the language in there is so similar to the language in the l eft behind books
7149615 the visual images in the ad which davis says has been viewed even more than the mccains
7149616 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance
7149617 those books have created a subliminal language and i think judgments will be made unconsciously about barack obama

7149643 from a safety point of view it was the right thing to do

7149645 satisfied the obligations and operated in strict compliance with all safety and licensing regulations

7149647 click here to continue following the interview style event easy setup
7149648 the idea is to keep it simple and let the java champions jc and java user group communities use these videos freely at their meetings and other activities to promote interest in java
7149649 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7149650 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7149651 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7149652 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7149653 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7149654 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7149655 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7149656 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7149657 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7149658 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7149659 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7149660 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7149661 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7149662 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7149663 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7149664 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7149665 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7149666 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7149667 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7149668 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7149669 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7149670 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7149671 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7149672 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7149673 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7149674 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7149675 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7149676 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7149677 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7149678 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7149679 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7149680 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7149681 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7149682 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7149683 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7149684 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7149685 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7149686 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7149687 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7149688 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7149689 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7149690 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7149691 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7149692 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7149693 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7149694 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7149695 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7149696 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7149697 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7149698 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7149699 who are open to doing something on the production side
7149700 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7149701 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7149702 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7149703 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7149704 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7149705 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7149706 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7149707 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7149708 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7149709 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7149710 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7149711 we feel bad for him because this is his senior season and hes a huge part of our team its a good thing that this isnt season ending ill take him for five games rather than for nothing at all
7149712 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7149713 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7149714 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7149715 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7149716 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7149717 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7149718 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7149719 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7149720 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7149721 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7149722 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7149723 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7149724 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7149725 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7149726 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7149727 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7149728 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7149729 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7149730 and i highly recommend it view the space as just that
7149731 wow websites are interesting but does it really do anything
7149732 se adapta permanentemente a las necesidades de un mercado que desde hace un a o demanda productos a un precio muy asequible sobre todo en los ltimos meses
7149733 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7149734 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7149735 this really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought
7149736 the caves havent been disturbed by anything we can see what happened on the scale of a few decades in lakes of the appalachian region youre looking more at the scale of a millennium
7149737 breathe less changing the mix of light and heavy carbon atoms in it
7149738 global warming will leave things like this in the dust the natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming

7149952 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
7149953 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected
7149954 we couldnt get someone on the phone in hawaii to tell us whether the number represented some secret information and we erred on the side of blacking it out since then weve found out its pretty irrelevant for the outside world

7149958 if im wrong im out of here but it is incumbent upon you to ask your candidate to confirm that he is a citizen and produce the necessary documentation and if he doesnt do it then this party is going to go down the drain
7149959 you know you were ten miles from the alabama border and if those news media people hadnt been there you might never have been heard from again

7149981 there are a number of small and important measures to which we are opposed and as a matter of principle we will oppose them
7149982 supplies much more advanced data services which include both internet based radio and video streams as well as
7149983 no its one of those things if its out there and you can get it you know go ahead im certainly not going to get into lars ulrich mode about this

7149995 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7149996 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7149997 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7149998 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7149999 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
